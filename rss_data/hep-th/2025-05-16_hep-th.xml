      <title>Topology and the Conformal Invariance of Nodal Lines in Two-Dimensional Active Scalar Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse cascade in two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence exhibits a mysterious phenomenon. Numerical simulations have shown that the nodal isolines of certain scalars actively transported in the flow (eg, the vorticity in Navier-Stokes theory) obey Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), which indicates the presence of conformal invariance. Therefore, these turbulent isolines are somehow in the same class as cluster boundaries in equilibrium statistical mechanical models at criticality, such as critical percolation. In this paper, we propose that the inverse cascade is characterized by a local energy (or in some cases, enstrophy) flux field that spontaneously breaks time reversal invariance. The turbulent state consists of random constant flux domains, with the nodal isolines acting as domain walls where the local flux vanishes. The generalized circulation of the domains is proportional to a topological winding number. We argue that these turbulent states are gapped states, in analogy with quantum Hall systems. The turbulent flow consists of many strongly coupled vortices that are analogous to quasi-particles. The nodal isolines are associated with the gapless topological degrees of freedom in the flow, where scale invariance is enhanced to conformal invariance. We introduce a concrete model of this behavior using a two-dimensional effective theory involving the canonical Clebsch scalars. This theory has patch solutions that exhibit power law scaling. The fractional winding number associated with the patches can be related to the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan scaling dimension of the corresponding fluid theory. We argue that the fully developed inverse cascade is a scale invariant gas of these patches. This theory has a conformally invariant sector described by a Liouville conformal field theory whose central charge is fixed by the fractional winding number.</description>

      <title>Defect Conformal Manifolds from Phantom (Non-Invertible) Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a general mechanism that allows (1+1)d CFTs to have interesting interface conformal manifolds even in the absence of any continuous internal symmetry or supersymmetry. This is made possible by the breaking of an enhanced continuous symmetry, which is generically non-invertible, arising in the folded theory. We provide several examples and showcase the power of the symmetry-based approach by computing the evolution of the reflection coefficient along the defect conformal manifold. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations and we comment on no-go theorems.</description>

      <title>Finite Cut-Off Holography and the DBI Counter-Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate some very special features of the Dirac-Born-Infeld--like (DBI) gravitational counter-term in AdS$_4$ spacetime, in the context of holography with a sharp radial cut-off. We show that the three-sphere partition function is not only independent of a constant radial cut-off, but also remains unchanged under deformations of the cut-off surface. We also consider the renormalized holographic entanglement entropy for an equatorial Ryu-Takayanagi surface with a cut-off with an arbitrary shape and show that it can also be independent of the cut-off under a special condition. We also numerically study the behavior of the renormalized entropy with different counter-terms and relate the results to monotonicity properties under holographic renormalization group flow. The DBI counter-term is always seen to be associated with integrating out fewer degrees of freedom compared to other counter-terms.</description>

      <title>Quantum censors: backreaction builds horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic censorship posits spacetime singularities remain concealed behind event horizons, preserving the determinism of General Relativity. While quantum gravity is expected to resolve singularities, we argue that cosmic censorship remains necessary whenever spacetime has a reliable semi-classical description. Using holography to construct exact solutions to semi-classical gravity, we show backreaction of quantum matter generates horizons -- quantum censors -- to thwart potential violations of censorship. Along with a quantum Penrose inequality, this provides compelling evidence cosmic censorship is robust, even nonperturbatively, in semi-classical gravity.</description>

      <title>Scale without Conformal Invariance in bottom-up Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In holography, the isometry group of the bulk spacetime corresponds to the symmetries of the boundary theory. We thus approach the question of whether (and when) scale invariance in combination with Poincar\'e invariance implies full conformal invariance in quantum field theory from a holographic bulk perspective. To do so, we study bulk spacetimes that include a warped extra dimension and in which the isometry group corresponds to scale without conformal invariance. Firstly, we show that the bulk Weyl tensor plays a pivotal role in distinguishing those metrics exhibiting conformal invariance (Weyl=0) from those merely exhibiting scale invariance (Weyl$\neq$0). Based on this, we then prove the following theorem: For putative boundary theories with $n\geq2$ dimensions, the bulk metric can not exhibit scale without conformal invariance if its warped extra dimension is compact and the null energy condition is required to hold. For $n=1$, we discuss that a more general ansatz for the bulk metric must be made, a detailed analysis of which is left for future research.</description>

      <title>Leading singularities and chambers of Correlahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Chamber dissection of the loop-geometry of Correlehedron, which encodes the loop integrand of four-point stress-energy correlators in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. We demonstrate that at four loops, continuing the pattern of lower loops, the integrand of four-point correlation function can be written as a sum over products of chamber-forms and local loop integrands. The chambers and their associated forms are identical to those of three-loops, indicating that the dissection may be complete to all loop orders. Furthermore, this suggests that the leading singularities to all loops are simply linear combinations of these chamber forms. This is especially intriguing at four loops since it contains elliptic functions. Interestingly, each elliptic function appears in a subset of chambers. Our geometric approach allows us to ``diagonalize" the representation, where the local integrals only possess a single leading singularity or elliptic cut. In such a representation, all integrals must evaluate to pure functions, including a single pure elliptic integral. Inspired by this picture, we also present a simplified form of the three-loop correlator in terms of two independent pure functions (weight-$6$ single-valued multiple polylogarithms), which are directly computed from local integrals with unit leading singularities, multiplied by the leading singularities from chamber forms.</description>

      <title>Matching high and low temperature regimes of massive scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the matching of high and low temperature expansions of the effective action of massive scalar fields confined between two infinite walls with different boundary conditions. One remarkable low temperature effect is the exponential decay of the vacuum energy with the separation of the walls and the fact that the rate of decay is half for the boundary conditions which involve a connection between the boundary conditions of the two walls. In particular, the rate for Dirichlet boundary conditions is double than that of periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Black Hole Interior from the Exterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that an observer outside the horizon can reconstruct the geometry of a black hole's interior through external measurements. This procedure builds on recent studies of the holographic duality of timelike entanglement entropy and its connection to spacelike entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we propose that this phenomenon reveals a fundamental correlation between the degrees of freedom inside and outside the black hole at the level of classical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Background fields in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of a general local gauge theory can be encoded in the structure of a so-called presymplectic gauge PDE -- an almost-$Q$ bundle over the spacetime exterior algebra, equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure. In the case of a trivial bundle and an invertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma model construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parameterised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant generalisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very concise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin gauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly discuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework using the simplest example of the Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>Mutual information and holographic entanglement entropy for strongly-coupled R-charged plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically evaluate, for slab entangling geometries, the mutual information and the holographic entanglement entropy between strongly interacting fields in different spatial regions for two different conformal holographic models at finite temperature and R-charge density. The 1 R-Charge Black Hole (1RCBH) model describes a strongly interacting fluid with a critical point in its phase diagram, while the 2 R-Charge Black Hole (2RCBH) model has no critical point. In both cases, we find that the mutual information in the thermodynamically stable branch of black hole solutions is reduced by increasing the value of the dimensionless ratio of R-charge chemical potential over temperature, $\mu/T$, indicating that the R-charge chemical potential acts as a suppressor of total correlations between fields in two disjoint spatial regions of a hot and dense strongly interacting medium. Moreover, the mutual information between the fields in the two disjoint regions is observed to be enhanced by increasing the size of these regions, with such an enhancement asymptotically saturating. The finite part of the entanglement entropy may change sign depending on the values of $\mu/T$ and the variable size $\ell$ of the entangling slab geometry, and it correctly detects the critical point of the 1RCBH model, a feature that is also adequately detected by the mutual information.</description>

      <title>Correlators of Line Defect and Local Operator in Conformal Field Theories with a Slightly Broken Higher-Spin Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three-dimensional conformal field theories with a large-$N$ limit. Leveraging the framework of slightly broken higher-spin symmetry, we bootstrap correlation functions between the single-trace, local operators and straight, conformal line defects with boundaries. These correlation functions, which depend on a single conformal cross-ratio, encapsulate all bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients. Concentrating on the quasi-fermionic theory, we explicitly compute all correlators involving the spin-zero and spin-one conserved currents, along with an infinite family of correlators involving the higher-spin currents. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dependence of these correlators on the defect's shape is fully determined by our bootstrap constraints.</description>

      <title>Classification of Feynman integral geometries for black-hole scattering at 5PM order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman integral geometries relevant to the scattering of two black holes at fifth order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, i.e. at four loops. The analysis includes integrals relevant to both the conservative and dissipative dynamics, as well as to all orders in the self-force (SF) expansion, i.e. the 0SF, 1SF and 2SF orders. By relating the geometries of integrals across different loop orders and integral families, we find that out of the 16,596 potentially contributing integral topologies, only 70 need to be analyzed in detail. By further computing their leading singularities using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation, we show that there only appear two different three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries and two different K3 surfaces at this loop order, which together characterize the space of functions beyond polylogarithms to which the 5PM integrals evaluate.</description>

      <title>Thermal holographic correlators and KMS condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal two-point functions in holographic CFTs receive contributions from two parts. One part comes from the identity, the stress tensor and multi-stress tensors and constitutes the stress-tensor sector. The other part consists of contributions from double-trace operators. The sum of these two parts must satisfy the KMS condition -- it has to be periodic in Euclidean time. The stress-tensor sector can be computed by analyzing the bulk equations of motions near the AdS boundary and is not periodic by itself. We show that starting from the expression for the stress-tensor sector one can impose the KMS condition to fix the double-trace part, and hence the whole correlator. We perform explicit calculations in the asymptotic approximation, where the stress-tensor sector can be computed exactly. One can either sum over the thermal images of the stress-tensor sector and subtract the singularities or solve for the KMS condition directly and perform the Borel resummation of the resulting double-trace data -- the results are the same.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that black holes microstates leave an imprint on the gravitational vacuum through their virtual fluctuations. This imprint yields a power law fall off -- rather than an exponential fall off -- for the entanglement of planck scale fluctuations at different points. These entanglements generate an extra energy when space stretches too {\it fast}, since causality prevents a relaxation of these entanglements to their vacuum values. We obtain semiclassical dynamics for slow processes like star formation, but a radical departure from semiclassicality when a black hole horizon forms even though curvatures remain low everywhere. This resolution of the information puzzle also implies an extra energy source at the scale of the cosmological horizon, which may explain the mysteries of dark energy and the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological observations of the recent universe suggest that dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is growing with time, departing from a cosmological constant for which $w=-1$. Standard quintessence models allow for a varying $w\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w&lt;-1$, is quickly reached in the past. Often discarded because of uncertainties or parametrisation, we rather propose here to embrace the reality of this phantom regime. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a coupling of quintessence field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation). We show that this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with string-inspired models, where $V=V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \varphi}$ and $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$. Those provide solutions in very good agreement with observations, including the phantom regime. We then discuss poles that can appear in $w$, making it diverge at recent times ($z\leq 4$), and that could be detected by observations. We finally comment on an Early Dark Energy-like feature, that systematically appears for free from the models considered, and could be of interest for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal theory in which baryon number is spontaneously broken at the low scale predicts new fermions, one of which is a dark matter candidate, from gauge anomaly cancellation. We discuss the production mechanisms and decays of these new fermions, which include channels with multi-leptons, and channels with long-lived charged fermions that can give rise to exotic signatures with 'kinked' tracks at the Large Hadron Collider. We evaluate the contraints on the theory from current LHC searches and measurements, and briefly comment on the excess in top pair production at threshold recently reported by CMS. We also discuss predictions for the $h \to \gamma Z_B$ decay, where $h$ is the SM-like Higgs and $Z_B$ is the new gauge boson associated with baryon number.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Squeezed States for One and Two Modes, and a No-Go Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and uniqueness of squeezed vacuum states defined by annihilation conditions of the form $(a - \alpha a^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ and their multimode generalizations. For $N=1$ and $N=2$, we rigorously show that these conditions uniquely define the standard single- and two-mode squeezed states in the Fock basis. We then analyze a cyclically coupled $N$-mode system governed by $(a_i - \alpha_i a_{i+1}^\dagger)|\psi\rangle = 0$ with $a_{N+1} \equiv a_1$. Although the recurrence structure restricts solutions to equal-photon-number states, we prove that for $N&gt;2$ no such state satisfies the full set of conditions. This establishes a sharp no-go result for multipartite squeezed states under cyclic annihilation constraints, underscoring a fundamental structural limitation beyond pairwise squeezing.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes from Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that regular black holes arise as the unique spherically symmetric solutions of broad families of generalizations of Einstein gravity involving infinite towers of higher-curvature corrections in $D\geq 5$ spacetime dimensions. In this paper we argue that such regular black holes arise as the byproduct of the gravitational collapse of pressureless dust stars. We show that, just like for Einstein gravity, the modified junction conditions for these models impose that the dust particles on the star surface follow geodesic trajectories on the corresponding black hole background. Generically, in these models the star collapses until it reaches a minimum size (and a maximum density) inside the inner horizon of the black hole it creates. Then, it bounces back and reappears through a white hole in a different universe, where it eventually reaches its original size and restarts the process. Along the way, we study FLRW cosmologies in the same theories that regularize black hole singularities. We find that the cosmological evolution is completely smooth, with the big bang and big crunch singularities predicted by Einstein gravity replaced by cosmological bounces.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we present a brief overview of connections between Chern-Simons theory and topological strings. A prominent role in this link has been played by large N dualities and holography. We demystify this by explaining why the Kahler form should be viewed as dual to the field strength associated with a 3-form gauge potential, sourced by Lagrangian D-branes. We explain how this leads to the computation of topological string amplitudes in terms of topological vertex for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. Furthermore, applications of topological strings to a conceptual derivation of Skein relations for link invariants as well as some of its physical applications to black hole physics are also reviewed.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the WIMP quality problem and R-parity violation in natural supersymmetry with all axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In supersymmetric models where the mu problem is solved via discrete R-symmetries, then both the global U(1)_{PQ} (Peccei-Quinn, needed to solve the strong CP problem) and R-parity conservation (RPC, needed for proton stability) are expected to arise as accidental, approximate symmetries. Then in some cases, SUSY dark matter is expected to be all axions since the relic lightest SUSY particles (LSPs) can decay away via small R-parity violating (RPV) couplings. We examine several aspects of this {\it all axion} SUSY dark matter scenario. 1. We catalogue the operator suppression which is gained from discrete R-symmetry breaking via four two-extra-field base models. 2. We present exact tree-level LSP decay rates including mixing and phase space effects and compare to results from simple, approximate formulae. 3. Natural SUSY models are characterized by light higgsinos with mass ~100-350 GeV so that the dominant sparticle production cross sections at LHC14 are expected to be higgsino pair production which occurs at the 10^2-10^4 fb level. Assuming nature is natural, the lack of an RPV signal from higgsino pair production in LHC data translates into rather strong upper bounds on nearly all trilinear RPV couplings in order to render the SUSY signal (nearly) invisible. Thus, in natural SUSY models with light higgsinos, the RPV-couplings must be small enough that the LSP has a rather high quality of RPC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate quasinormal modes in holographic QCD models from the perspective of the WKB approximation. We derive the generalized Bohr Sommerfeld quantization rules for quasi-stationary states in holographic QCD models. As a simple application of these formulas, we compute the quasinormal modes of scalar and vector fields in the soft wall model, where an analytic expression for the real part of the frequency can be found in the low temperature regime. Additionally, this study provides useful insights into the dissociation process in holographic QCD models.</description>

      <title>Two-local modifications of SYK model with quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model may provide us with a good starting point for the experimental study of quantum chaos and holography in the laboratory. Still, the four-local interaction of fermions makes quantum simulation challenging, and it would be good to search for simpler models that keep the essence. In this paper, we argue that the four-local interaction may not be important by introducing a few models that have two-local interactions. The first model is a generalization of the spin-SYK model, which is obtained by replacing the spin variables with SU($d$) generators. Simulations of this class of models might be straightforward on qudit-based quantum devices. We study the case of $d=3, 4, 5, 6$ numerically and observe quantum chaos already for two-local interactions in a wide energy range. We also introduce modifications of spin-SYK and SYK models that have similar structures to the SU($d$) model (e.g., $H=\sum_{p,q}J_{pq}\chi_p\chi_{p+1}\chi_q\chi_{q+1}$ instead of the original SYK Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{p,q,r,s}J_{pqrs}\chi_p\chi_q\chi_r\chi_{s}$), which shows strongly chaotic features although the interaction is essentially two-local. These models may be a good starting point for the quantum simulation of the original SYK model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type through the usage of ansatz for $U$-$V$ (Lax) pair with spectral parameter satisfying the semi-discrete Zakharov-Shabat equation. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. Equations of motion are obtained using a set of $R$-matrix identities. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equations.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.04911 \pm 0.00084$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001~159~652~183~56(76)$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Charged wormholes in (anti-)de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of charged, traversable wormhole solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant. In de Sitter spacetime, two types of wormhole throats can exist--referred to as typical and cosmological throat--located at small and large radial values, respectively. In anti-de Sitter spacetime, the throat geometry allows for positive, zero, or negative curvature, enabling the possibility of an infinite throat area. We analyze the flare-out condition, a key requirement for the existence of traversable wormholes, which imposes constraints on the equation of state parameters governing the supporting matter. These solutions are shown to be of Petrov type D. Furthermore, we examine radial geodesics of null and timelike particles. In the de Sitter case, particles traverse the wormhole, passing from one throat to the other. In contrast, in the anti-de Sitter case, particles exhibit recurrent oscillatory motion between two asymptotic regions, cyclically disappearing and reappearing across the throats.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquids: the nonperturbative renormalization group perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a thorough theoretical framework based on the nonperturvative renormalization group (RG) a la Wetterich to tackle the interplay of coupled fermionic and order-parameter fluctuations at metallic quantum critical points with ordering wavevectors $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$. We consistently treat the dynamical emergence of the Landau damping of the bosonic mode and non-Fermi liquid scaling of fermions upon lowering the cutoff scale. The loop integrals of the present theory involve only contributions from fluctuations above the cutoff scale, which drive the system to a non-Fermi liquid RG fixed point of different scaling properties from those obtained within the random phase approximation (RPA) or expansions around it. In particular the scaling exponent for the Fermi self-energy acquires the value $\alpha\approx 0.50$ rather than the anticipated $\alpha\approx 0.66$, while the bosonic dynamical exponent $z\approx 2$. We demonstrate how results characteristic for the RPA-type fixed-point scaling are recovered in our framework by a questionable procedure of removing the fermionic cutoff much faster than the bosonic one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double Field Theory (DFT) has emerged as a comprehensive framework for gravity, presenting a testable and robust alternative to General Relativity (GR), rooted in the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry principle of string theory. These lecture notes aim to provide an accessible introduction to DFT, structured in a manner similar to traditional GR courses. Key topics include doubled-yet-gauged coordinates, Riemannian versus non-Riemannian parametrisations of fundamental fields, covariant derivatives, curvatures, and the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric augmentation of the Einstein field equation, identified as the unified field equation for the closed string massless sector. By offering a novel perspective, DFT addresses unresolved questions in GR and enables the exploration of diverse physical phenomena, paving the way for significant future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Randall-Sundrum model with the Higgs localized on the IR brane solves the gauge hierarchy problem. However, the associated low cutoff ($\Lambda \sim 10$ TeV) generically leads to unacceptably rapid nucleon decay and excessively large Majorana neutrino masses. Achieving consistency while simultaneously explaining the Yukawa hierarchy requires either a horizontal symmetry or a discrete gauged symmetry. We demonstrate that eliminating all dangerous operators within a horizontal symmetry framework must come with large and unattractive charge assignments, if possible at all. Hence, we consider an exact discrete gauged $\mathbf{Z}_N$ symmetry, with fermion mass hierarchies generated via wavefunction overlap. We employ this to reproduce the current CKM and PMNS structures. Under minimal assumptions, it predicts Dirac neutrinos with a total mass $\sim 66$ meV. Since the $\mathbf{Z}_N$ charges must be generation-blind, flavor observables serve as key probes.</description>

      <title>Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</description>

Abstract: The Dicke model, renowned for its superradiant quantum phase transition (QPT), also exhibits a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics. In this work, we provide a systematic, comparative study of static and dynamical indicators of chaos for the closed and open Dicke model. In the closed Dicke model, we find that indicators of chaos sensitive to long-range correlations in the energy spectrum such as the the spectral form factor can deviate from the Poissonian random matrix theory (RMT) predictions and show a dip-ramp-plateau feature even in the normal region of the Dicke model unless very large values of the spin size are chosen. Thus, care is needed in using such indicators of chaos. In the open Dicke model with cavity damping, we find that the dissipative spectral form factor emerges as a robust diagnostic displaying a quadratic dip-ramp-plateau behavior in agreement with the Ginebre Unitary Ensemble (GinUE) RMT in the superradiant regime. Moreover, by examining the spectral properties of the Liouvillian, we provide indirect evidence for the concurrence of the dissipative superradiant quantum phase transition and the change in Liouvillian eigenvalue statistics from 2-D Poissonian to GinUE RMT behavior.</description>

      <title>A $T_2 \times R^2$ roadmap to Confinement in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of \SU{2} Yang-Mills fields on a $T_2\times R^2$ geometry where the two-torus is equipped with twisted boundary conditions. We monitor the evolution of the dynamics of the system as a function of the torus size $l_s$. For small sizes the behaviour of the system is well understood in terms of semiclassical predictions. In our case, the long distance structure is that of a two-dimensional gas of vortex-like fractional instantons with size and density growing with $l_s$. Our lattice Monte Carlo simulations confirm the semiclassical predictions and allow the determination of the relevant scale signalling the transition to the non-dilute situation. At low densities the string tension takes the standard value of a 2D center-vortex gas, growing with the density and approaching the value measured at infinite volume. Our work includes preliminary studies of the extension to \SU{N} and to the region of large sizes in which boundary conditions are irrelevant, and all physical scales are determined by the $\Lambda$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Causality and stability of magnetohydrodynamics for an ultrarelativistic locally neutral two-component gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the causality and stability of the relativistic theory of magnetohydrodynamics derived in Phys. Rev. D 109, 096021 (2024) to describe a locally neutral two-component plasma of massless particles. We show that this formalism is linearly causal and stable around global equilibrium, for any value of the magnetic field and discuss its qualitative differences to the traditional Israel-Stewart formalism in the linear regime. Finally, we compare this framework with the magnetohydrodynamic model used in the study of astrophysical plasmas, in which only the longitudinal component of the shear-stress tensor is considered. We discuss the domain of applicability of this type of framework in the context of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in the Two-Site SYK and SYK Chain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent study of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions suggested that the model does not rapidly thermalize, despite being maximally chaotic. In this work, I examine the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for both the SYK chain and the two-site SYK models using exact diagonalization. I show that single realizations of both models approximately satisfy ETH conditions, while ensemble averages strictly satisfy ETH. Therefore, I conclude that the finite-size SYK chain and two-site SYK models can rapidly thermalize with respect to generic few-body operators through the ETH mechanism. This suggests that the subthermal behavior observed in previous studies of R\'enyi entanglement entropy does not manifest in finite-size systems, and that these systems can thermalize rapidly via their light modes. It also indicates that the proposed gravitational dual may undergo rapid thermalization.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lecture notes bridge a gap between introductory quantum field theory (QFT) courses and state-of-the-art research in scattering amplitudes. They cover the path from basic definitions of QFT to amplitudes relevant for processes in the Standard Model of particle physics. The book begins with a concise yet self-contained introduction into QFT, including perturbative quantum gravity. It then presents modern methods for calculating scattering amplitudes, focusing on tree-level amplitudes, loop-level integrands and loop-integration techniques. These methods help reveal intriguing relations between gauge and gravity amplitudes, and are of increasing importance for obtaining high-precision predictions for collider experiments, such as those at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, as well as for foundational mathematical physics studies in QFT, including recent applications to gravitational wave physics. These course-tested lecture notes include numerous exercises with detailed solutions. Requiring only minimal knowledge of QFT, they are well-suited for MSc and PhD students as a preparation for research projects in theoretical particle physics. They can be used as a one-semester graduate level course, or as a self-study guide for researchers interested in fundamental aspects of QFT. Supplementary material, Mathematica notebooks, corrections and further information are provided and maintained at the dedicated website https://scattering-amplitudes.mpp.mpg.de/scattering-amplitudes-in-qft/ .</description>

      <title>Isospin precession in non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of pseudoclassical isospin is illustrated by the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect proposed by Wu and Yang in 1975. The spatial motion is free however the isospin precesses when the enclosed magnetic flux and the incoming particle's isosopin are not parallel. The non-Abelian phase factor $\mathfrak{F}$ of Wu and Yang acts on the isospin as an S-matrix. The scattering becomes side-independent when the enclosed flux is quantized, ${\Phi}_N=N\Phi_0$ with $N$ an integer. The gauge group $SU(2)$ is an internal symmetry and generates conserved charges only when the flux is quantized, which then splits into two series: for $N=2k$ $SU(2)$ acts trivially but for $N=1+2k$ the implementation is twisted. The orbital and the internal angular momenta are separately conserved. The double rotational symmetry is broken to $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ when $N$ odd. For unquantized flux there are no internal symmetries, the charge is not conserved and protons can be turned into neutrons.</description>

      <title>Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.</description>

      <title>Towards celestial chiral algebras of self-dual black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits.</description>

      <title>Towards new relativistic doubly $\kappa$-deformed D=4 quantum phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new noncommutative models of quantum phase spaces, containing a pair of $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebras, with two independent double ($\kappa,\tilde{\kappa}$)-deformations in space-time and four-momenta sectors. The first such quantum phase space can be obtained by contractions $M,R\to \infty$ of recently introduced doubly $\kappa$-deformed $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-Yang models, with the parameters $M,R$ describing inverse space-time and four-momenta curvatures and constant four-vectors $a_\mu, b_\mu$ determining nine types of $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-deformations. The second considered model is provided by the nonlinear doubly $\kappa$-deformed TSR algebra spanned by 14 coset $\hat{o}(1,5)/\hat {o}(2)$ generators. The basic algebraic difference between the two models is the following: the first one, described by $\hat{o}(1,5)$ Lie algebra can be supplemented by the Hopf algebra structure, while the second model contains the quantum phase space commutators $[\hat{x}_\mu,\hat{q}_\nu]$, with the standard numerical $i\hbar\eta_{\mu\nu}$ term; therefore it describes the quantum-deformed Heisenberg algebra relations which cannot be equipped with the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Poincare field theory for massless particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main proposition is that field equations for all spins can be obtained from Casimir eigenvalue equations for Poincare group. We have already confirm that statement for massive scalar, spinor and vector fields in Ref.[1]. In the present article we are going to confirm this statement for massless vector, second and fourth rang tensor fields. In particular we will obtain Maxwell equations and Einstein equation in weak field approximation.
  As is well known, Wigner define a particles as irreducible representation of Poincare group [2,3]. But, as Weinberg noted in [4] irreducible representations for massless vector field with helicities $\pm 1$ do not exist. In the present article we will conform this statement for a wide class of massless fields. They are not Lorentz invariant since their Lorentz transformations have additional term in the form of gauge transformations. Such fields can appear in the theory only in the form which do not depend on corresponding gauge parameters. These forms are our equations of motion and they are by definition gauge invariant. So, the massless case is significantly different from massive one. In the end we will show that our approach can reproduce main contributions from well known articles with highest helicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity amplitudes in fully compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular, finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable, meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported by a wide variety of string theory examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, we incorporate non-localities introduced via the inverse of the d'Alembert operators acting on the scalar curvature. We analyse the dynamical structure of the theory and, adopting a scalar-tensor perspective, assess the stability conditions to ensure the absence of ghost instabilities. Focusing on a special class of well-defined hybrid actions -- where local and non-local contributions are carried by distinct types of curvature -- we investigate the feasibility of inflation within the resulting Einstein-frame multi-field scenario. We examine how the non-minimal kinetic couplings between the fields, reflecting the non-local structure of the original frame, influence the number of e-folds and the field trajectories. To clarify the physical interpretation of our results, we draw analogies with benchmark single-field inflation scenarios that include spectator fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the transition rates for the decay of $W^{\pm}$ bosons into leptons in de Sitter spacetime. From the results obtained in the de Sitter geometry we recover the Minkowski limits of the transition rates. We also study the emission of $W^{\pm}$ bosons by leptons, a process which is possible only in the large expansion conditions of the early universe. These results are obtainable due to perturbative methods which allow us to compute the transition amplitudes in the first order of perturbation theory. The resulting probabilities and rates depend on the particle masses and the Hubble parameter. In order to establish finite expressions for the probabilities and transition rates, we make use of dimensional regularization and the minimal substraction method.</description>

Abstract: In strongly-deformed planar ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, or fishnet theory, a point-split single-trace correlation function of four dimension-$m$ scalar operators is given by a single Feynman integral, which involves integrating over locations of a $m\times m$ grid of points. We show that for any integer $m$ this square fishnet graph is invariant under the combined action of a kinematic map and the antipode map of the Hopf algebra on multiple polylogarithms, i.e. it possesses an antipodal self-duality.</description>

An amplitude for such a tunneling process might be constructed as $\mathsf{T}_{i\to j}\sim e^{-S_{\mathrm{ inst}}}{\mathbf{v}}_j^{+}{\mathbf{v}}_i^{-}$, where there is canonical instanton action suppression, and $\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$ annihilates a particle in the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum, whereas $\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ creates a particle in the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum. Adiabatic change of the wells leads to a Berry-phase evolution of the couplings, which is described by the zero-curvature Gauss-Manin connection i.e. by a quantum $R$-matrix. Zero-curvature is actually a consequence of level repulsion or topological protection, and its implication is the Yang-Baxter relation for the $R$-matrices. In the simplest case the story is pure Abelian and not very exciting. But when the model becomes more involved, incorporates supersymmetry, gauge and other symmetries, such amplitudes obtain more intricate structures. Operators $\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$, $\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ might also evolve from ordinary Heisenberg operators into a more sophisticated algebraic object -- a ``tunneling algebra''. The result for the tunneling algebra would depend strongly on geometry of the QFT we started with, and, unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to solve the reverse engineering problem. In this note we revise few successful cases of the aforementioned correspondence: quantum algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ and affine Yangians $Y(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. For affine Yangians we demonstrate explicitly how instantons ``perform'' equivariant integrals over associated quiver moduli spaces appearing in the alternative geometric construction.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries of two-dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global symmetries can be generalised to transformations generated by topological operators, including cases in which the topological operator does not have an inverse. A family of such topological operators are intimately related to dualities via the procedure of half-space gauging. In this work we discuss the construction of non-invertible defects based on T-duality in two dimensions, generalising the well-known case of the free compact boson to any Non-Linear Sigma Model with Wess-Zumino term which is T-dualisable. This requires that the target space has an isometry with compact orbits that acts without fixed points. Our approach allows us to include target spaces without non-trivial 1-cycles, does not require the NLSM to be conformal, and when it is conformal it does not need to be rational; moreover, it highlights the microscopic origin of the topological terms that are responsible for the non-invertibility of the defect. An interesting class of examples are Wess-Zumino-Witten models, which are self-dual under a discrete gauging of a subgroup of the isometry symmetry and so host a topological defect line with Tambara-Yamagami fusion. Along the way, we discuss how the usual 0-form symmetries match across T-dual models in target spaces without 1-cycles, and how global obstructions can prevent locally conserved currents from giving rise to topological operators.</description>

Abstract: Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker factor, that can also be repackaged as solutions of 4d models, i.e. as 4d consistent truncations. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universal cosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential. For an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature), these models generally possess many desirable features: parametric control of e-folds, late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials (i.e. in accordance with swampland bounds), small string-loop and $\alpha'$-corrections, scale separation and/or absence of decompactification.</description>

Abstract: For a plane gravitational wave whose profile is given, in Brinkmann coordinates, by a $2\times2$ symmetric traceless matrix $K(U)$, the matrix Sturm-Liouville equation $\ddot{P}=KP$ plays a multiple and central r\^ole: (i) it determines the isometries, (ii) it appears as the key tool for switching from Brinkmann to BJR coordinates and vice versa, (iii) it determines the trajectories of particles initially at rest. All trajectories can be obtained from trivial "Carrollian" ones by a suitable action of the (broken) Carrollian isometry group.</description>

Abstract: Kepler's rescaling becomes, when "Eisenhart-Duval lifted" to $5$-dimensional "Bargmann" gravitational wave spacetime, an ordinary spacetime symmetry for motion along null geodesics, which are the lifts of Keplerian trajectories. The lifted rescaling generates a well-behaved conserved Noether charge upstairs, which takes an unconventional form when expressed in conventional terms. This conserved quantity seems to have escaped attention so far. Applications include the Virial Theorem and also Kepler's Third Law. The lifted Kepler rescaling is a Chrono-Projective transformation. The results extend to celestial mechanics and Newtonian Cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.00838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bialynicki-Birula and Charzynski argued that a gravitational wave emitted during the merger of a black hole binary may be approximated by a circularly polarized wave which may in turn trap particles [1]. In this paper we consider particle motion in a class of gravitational waves which includes, besides circularly polarized periodic waves (CPP) [2], also the one proposed by Lukash [3] to study anisotropic cosmological models. Both waves have a 7-parameter conformal symmetry which contains, in addition to the generic 5-parameter (broken) Carroll group, also a 6th isometry. The Lukash spacetime can be transformed by a conformal rescaling of time to a perturbed CPP problem. Bounded geodesics, found both analytically and numerically, arise when the Lukash wave is of Bianchi type VI. Their symmetries can also be derived from the Lukash-CPP relation. Particle trapping is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide an efficient description of quantum evolution and quantum chaos, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>

Abstract: Holographic models that consider classical vector fields in a 5-d background provide successful effective descriptions for heavy vector meson spectra. This holds both in the vacuum and in a thermal medium, like the quark gluon plasma. However, it is somehow mysterious the way that these phenomenological models work. In particular, what is the role of the fifth dimension and what is the relation between the holographic 5-d background and the physical (4-d) heavy mesons. Hadrons, in contrast to leptons, are composite particles with some internal structure, that depends on the energy at which they are observed. In this work, a static meson is represented by a heavy quark-antiquark pair with an interaction described by a Nambu Goto string living in the same 5-d background that provides field solutions leading to masses and decay constants of charmonium states. The interaction potential that shows up is linear for large distances with a string tension consistent with the effective Cornell potential. Introducing temperature $T$ in the background it is found, for the $J/\psi$ case, that there is a deconfining transition at some critical value of $T$. The results obtained indicate that the 5-d background is effectively representing the internal structure of the (static) charmonium (quasi) states.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>A string loop origin for dark radiation and superheavy dark matter in type IIB compactifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the significance of string loop corrections, in a perturbative moduli stabilization scenario, focusing on their role in unraveling the origin of dark radiation in the late cosmological epoch and their correlation to dark matter. More specifically, a detailed analysis is provided in which the mass hierarchy of the normalized fields in the K{\"a}hler moduli sector is determined by the scales of the integer fluxes and the quantum corrections. Furthermore, we compute the previously underestimated contributions to the decay rates of moduli to axions, which behave as dark radiation, highlighting their connection to the aforementioned higher-order corrections. Two contrasting reheating scenarios (low-scale and high-scale) are provided, depending on the decay rate of the longest-lived particle into the Standard Model degrees of freedom through a Giudice-Masiero mechanism, while the effective number of neutrino species $\Delta N_{eff}$ remains below the respective bounds. Finally, a non-thermal dark matter scenario is proposed based on the decays of heavy scalar fields, where the main production mechanisms are investigated, leading to a dark matter candidate mass ranging from a few $GeV$ up to $10^{12}\; GeV$.</description>

Abstract: We present a diffeomorphism-invariant formulation of differential entropy for Riemannian spaces, providing a fine-grained, coordinate-independent notion of quantum information for continuous variables in physical space. To this end, we consider the generalization of the Wigner quasiprobability density function to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds and analytically continue Shannon's differential entropy to account for contributions from intermediate virtual quantum states. We illustrate the framework by computing the quantum phase-space entropy of harmonic oscillator energy eigenstates in both Minkowski and anti-de Sitter geometries. Furthermore, we derive a generalized entropic uncertainty relation, extending the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski inequality to curved backgrounds. By bridging concepts from information theory, differential geometry, and quantum physics, our work provides a systematic approach to studying continuous-variable quantum information in curved spaces.</description>

Abstract: Domain walls represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of gravitational waves produced by scalar perturbations generated from the gravitational wave network. Our findings indicate that the gravitational wave spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future gravitational wave experiments aimed at exploring the role of domain walls in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores gravitational phenomena associated with a non-commutative black hole. Geodesic equations are derived, and a thin accretion disk is analyzed to model the black hole shadow image, considering an optically thin, radiating, and infalling gas. Retrolensing effects are examined to trace photon emission configurations, while gravitational lensing is investigated through weak and strong deflection limits, with lensing equations and observables applied to Sagittarius A*. The study also includes calculations of time delay, energy deposition rate from neutrino annihilation, phase and probability of neutrino oscillation, and neutrino gravitational lensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field ($\mathbf E$) or/and temperature gradient ($\nabla_{\mathbf r} T$) is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. The anisotropy is caused by (1) differing Fermi velocities along the two mutually perpendicular momentum axes, and (2) tilting parameters. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field $\mathbf B$. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator, appearing in the linearized Boltzmann equation. The solution has to be found in a recursive manner, which produces terms in powers of $|\mathbf B|$. We discuss the validity of the Mott relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law for the Lorentz-operator-induced parts.</description>

      <title>Stochastic origin of primordial fluctuations in the Sky</title>

Abstract: We provide a study of the effects of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalisation of stochastic inflation on the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a model-independent single-field context. We demonstrate how the scalar perturbations' Infra-Red (IR) contributions and the emerging Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution characterise the Langevin equations for the ``soft" modes in the quasi-de Sitter background. Both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion-dominated regimes undergo a specific analysis of the distribution function using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, which helps us to evade a no-go theorem on the PBH mass. Using the EFT-induced alterations, we evaluate the local non-Gaussian parameters in the drift-dominated limit.</description>

      <title>Natural Top Quark Condensation (a Redux)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the multi-TeV mass scales and possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>

      <title>Deflection Angle in the Strong Deflection Limit and Quasinormal Modes in Stationary Axisymmetric Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a coordinate-invariant expression for the photon deflection angle in the strong deflection limit (SDL) of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. The key logarithmic-divergence coefficient is shown to depend only on quantities locally measurable by a zero-angular-momentum observer -- curvature scalars, the circumferential radius, and the proper angular velocity. The same coefficient governs the damping rate of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal limit, establishing a curvature-based, model-independent connection between QNMs and lensing in the SDL near rotating compact objects.</description>

      <title>Resonance of black hole quasinormal modes in coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) can exhibit resonant excitations associated with avoided crossings in their complex frequency spectrum. Such resonance phenomena can serve as novel signatures for probing new physics, where additional degrees of freedom are commonly introduced. Motivated by this possibility, we investigate QNMs in systems where multiple degrees of freedom are coupled with each other, and introduce a definition of excitation factors suitable for such systems. To demonstrate our formulation, we apply it to a black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theory, where we find that avoided crossings can appear even between longest-lived modes originating from the fundamental modes of different degrees of freedom, in contrast to the Kerr case in General Relativity. We show that the excitation factors are indeed amplified as a manifestation of resonance at parameter values corresponding to the avoided crossings.</description>
