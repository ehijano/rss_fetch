      <title>A Case Study on the Performance Metrics of Integrated Photonic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic processors use optical signals for computation, leveraging the high bandwidth and low loss of optical links. While many approaches have been proposed, including in memory photonic circuits, most efforts have focused on the physical design of photonic components rather than full architectural integration with electronic peripheral circuitry. In this work, we present a microarchitecture level study that estimates the compute efficiency and density of three prominent photonic computing architectures. Our evaluation accounts for both the photonic circuits and the essential peripheral electronics required for optoelectronic and analog to digital conversions. We further demonstrate a heterogenous photonic electronic in memory processing approach for low latency neural network inference. These results provide a better understanding of the design aspects of photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation and Optical Manipulation of Exciton-polariton Parametric Scattering Lasing in Temporal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid light-matter character of exciton-polaritons gives rise to distinct polariton parametric scattering (PPS) process, which holds promise for frontier applications in polaritonic quantum devices. However, the stable excitation and coherent optical manipulation of PPS remain challenging due to scattering bottlenecks and rapid dephasing effect in polariton many-body systems. In this study, we first report the direct observation and optical amplification of non-degenerate intermode PPS lasing at room temperature (RT). The specific polariton branch of strong-coupled nanobelt planar microcavity is resonantly excited by a near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser via two-photon absorption (TPA) scheme, and the non-degenerate signal- and idler-states are stimulated. Angle-resolved dispersion patterns clearly reveal the evolution of the pump-, signal-, and idler-states under different excitation powers. Based on our self-constructed ultrafast femtosecond resonant optical trigger set-up, a selective enhancement and modulation of the signal-state is realized. Furthermore, the dynamic measurements of nonlinear signal-state enhancement process demonstrate a sub-picosecond response time (0.4ps), confirming its potential for ultrafast optical manipulation. Our work establishes a platform for exploring TPA-driven PPS laser and provides a novel optical modulation route for polariton-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbor Tight-Binding Realization of Hyperbolic Lattices with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauge Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic framework for realizing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge extensions of hyperbolic lattices within the nearest-neighbor tight-binding formalism is developed. Using the triangle group $\Delta(2,8,8)$ as an example, we classify all inequivalent projective symmetry groups by computing the second cohomology group $H^2(\Delta(2,8,8),\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Each class corresponds to a distinct flux configuration and can be constructed by tight-binding models to verify the symmetry relations of the extended group. The translation subgroups of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extended lattices are associated with high genus surfaces, which follows the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. By applying the Abelian hyperbolic band theory, we find the all-flat dispersions along specific directions in momentum space and van Hove singularities correlated with discrete eigenenergies. Our results establish a general route to investigate gauge-extended hyperbolic lattices and provide a foundation for further studying symmetry fractionalization and spin liquid phases in non-Euclidean geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical nonreciprocity on a magnetic-free photonic chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking reciprocity enables new regimes of light-matter interaction with broad implications for fundamental physics and emerging quantum technologies. Although various approaches have been explored to achieve optical nonreciprocity, realizing it at the single-photon level has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate magnetic-free optical nonreciprocity -- including both isolation and circulation -- in the quantum regime, enabled by efficient and noiseless all-optical frequency conversion on an integrated photonic chip. Our device preserves the quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons while delivering exceptional performance parameters, meeting the stringent demands of classical and quantum information systems. This realization of quantum optical nonreciprocity in a scalable photonic platform opens a pathway toward directional quantum communication and noise-resilient quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Hyperentanglement in Nanophotonic Systems with Discrete Rotational Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate hyperentanglement between photons carrying angular momentum in nanophotonic systems with discrete rotational symmetry. Coupling free-space photons into surface plasmon polaritons by a polygonal-shaped grating restricts the basis of the generated near-field modes to a finite set, thus creating a new mechanism for spatial mode entanglement. By encoding the incoming photons with spin and orbital angular momenta, we find that the system preserves the high-dimensional Hilbert space, in contrast to rotationally symmetric nanophotonic platforms, where the inseparability of spin and orbital degrees of freedom results in loss of information. We further show that by properly engineering the phase of the photons to conform to the polygonal boundary conditions, we achieve a new scheme for generating hyperentangled states, utilizing both the vector-field nature of the nanophotonic modes and the finite basis of states in polygonal boundary conditions. Our approach paves the way for on-chip quantum communication by expanding the Hilbert space used in computation.</description>

      <title>Encoding orbital angular momentum of light in space with optical catastrophes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) possess an unbounded set of orthogonal modes, offering significant potential for optical communication and security. However, exploiting OAM beams in space has been hindered by the lack of a versatile design toolkit. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to tailor OAM across multiple transverse planes by shaping optical caustics leveraging on catastrophe theory. With complex-amplitude metasurfaces fabricated using two-photon polymerization lithography, we construct these caustics to steer Poynting vectors and achieve arbitrary shapes of OAM beams. Interestingly, we use such an approach to realize hidden OAM along the propagation trajectory, where the intensity of the beam is spread out thus avoiding detection. The OAM of these beams can be intrinsic, which avoids OAM distortions arising from the mixing of intrinsic and extrinsic components. By exploiting this intrinsic nature of OAM, we demonstrate the detection of encoded information in optical encryption. Our approach provides a unique framework for dynamic control of OAM in space, with promising applications in optical trapping and sensing, high-capacity data storage, and optical information security.</description>

      <title>Graphene enabled metamaterial absorber terahertz refractive-index sensor for biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a graphene enabled terahertz (THz) metamaterial (MTM) absorber configured as a refractive index (RI) sensor with electrically reconfigurable response and broadband index coverage. The unit cell is designed for impedance-matched absorption and modeled using full wave 3D electromagnetic simulation; S parameter and absorption analyses confirm a sharp resonance whose frequency is linearly responsive to the analyte RI. Angle and polarization studies, as well as geometry sweeps, establish robustness to incidence/polarization and identify the most sensitive geometric degrees of freedom; material sweeps further demonstrate controllability via graphene relaxation time and chemical potential. The device achieves a resonance at 8.436 THz with 99.99% absorption followed by FWHM = 0.626 THz, Q factor of 13.476, sensitivity of 1698 GHz/RIU, and FOM = 2.712 $RIU^{-1}$, maintaining a calibrated ultra wide RI operating range of 1.0-2.0 suitable for gases, solvents, polymers, oils, and higher index dielectrics, while naturally subsuming the biomedical window (1.30-1.39) for label-free biosensing. An equivalent circuit model reproduces the simulated spectra, validating the resonance mechanism. These results highlight the synergy of graphene's tunable conductivity with MTM field confinement to deliver a compact, high FOM THz RI sensor that is both electrically reconfigurable and broadly applicable across chemical, environmental, industrial, and biomedical domains.</description>

      <title>Intensity and Phase correction Enhanced interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric scattering microscopy was widely applied in nanoscopic detection and tracking due to its high sensitivity and label-free manner. The sensitivity is limited by contrast. Oblique illumination provided high contrast with lower power density. However, no model has been established to illustrate the schematic and complex rotation setup was needed. Here, we established a model of contrast and the unexpected reflections both in intensity and phase modulation. Then, the contrast enhancement was verified in oblique illumination. To provide a uniform contrast measurement, the phase map of oblique illumination was calibrated through scanning without the need for rotation. Our work gives new insights in oblique illumination and may inspire new idea to enhance contrast with phase and intensity modulation.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spatiotemporal wave packets with Gouy phase dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal (ST) wave packets refer to a broad class of optical pulses whose spatial and temporal dependence cannot be treated separately. Such space time non-separability can induce exotic physical effects such as non-diffraction, non-transverse waves, and sub or superluminal propagation. Here, a family of ST non-separable pulses is presented, where a modal order is proposed to extend their spatiotemporal structural complexity, analogous to the spatial higher-order Gaussian modes. The modal order is strongly coupled to the Gouy phase, which can unveil anomalous spatiotemporal dynamics, including ultrafast cycle-switching evolution, ST self-healing, and sub- or super-luminal propagation. We further introduce a stretch parameter that stretches the temporal envelope while keeping the Gouy-phase coefficient unchanged. This stretch invariance decouples pulse duration from modal order, allowing us to tune the few-cycle width without shifting temporal-revival positions or altering the phase or group-velocity laws. Moreover, an approach to analyzing the phase velocity and group velocity of the higher-order ST modes is proposed to quantitatively characterize the sub- or supe-luminal effects. The method is universal for a larger group of complex structured ultrafast pulses, laying the basis for both fundamental physics and advanced applications in ultrafast optics and structured light.</description>

      <title>NIR-II Fluorescence Project Technology for Augmented Reality Surgical Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NIR-II fluorescence imaging provides superior tissue penetration and clarity, yet its clinical use in surgical navigation is hindered by a critical workflow issue. Surgeons must divert their attention between the operative field and external monitors, increasing cognitive load and disrupting procedures. Current strategies have failed to resolve this fundamental problem. Here, we developed a co-axial NIR-II fluorescence projection navigation system to enable real-time, in situ visualization. This system creates an intraoperative augmented reality by directly projecting high-precision, pseudocolored fluorescence images onto the surgical field, spatially integrating functional signals with patient anatomy. Validated through in vitro, in vivo, and clinical patient studies, our system eliminates visual field switching, reduces intraoperative distraction, and preserves natural stereoscopic vision. This approach represents a paradigm shift toward a more coherent, efficient, and ergonomically optimized optical imaging modality for surgical navigation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Transfer Matrix Method for Exceptional-Point Media via Canonical Basis Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized temporal transfer matrix method (TTMM) for time-varying media that accurately captures wave dynamics in media operating at exceptional points (EPs). The method expands wave fields in the canonical basis of each temporal layer and derives the complete time evolution of all basis vectors. Temporal matching and phase-delay matrices are constructed from the generalized modal matrices and their corresponding eigenvalues. Additionally, an amplitude-boosting matrix is introduced to account for the power-law amplification of field amplitudes associated with EP dynamics. This matrix depends only on the order of the EP and naturally reduces to the identity matrix in its absence. The proposed TTMM is validated through two representative EP media, demonstrating its accuracy and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Direct Mapping of Intrinsic Topology of Bound States in the Continuum via Nonlinear Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct mapping of the intrinsic topology in a leaky photonic band is crucial and challenging in topological photonics. For instance, observables in bound states in the continuum (BICs) feature complex topological textures such as a polarization vortex in momentum space, which nonetheless is difficult to be characterized in far-field scattering, especially considering the dominant direct channel. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid nonlinear metasurface that enables a direct visualization of the intrinsic topology in BICs via second-harmonic generation (SHG). The enhanced local-source of SHG from the ultrathin indium tin oxide can effectively excite the emissions from the eigenmodes of a TiO2 photonics crystal slab, achieving three-order enhancement of SHG magnitudes. Importantly, these enhanced SH emissions carry topological polarization textures of BICs to the far field. With this, we can directly construct polarization vector maps of symmetry-protected BICs and chiral symmetry-broken quasi-BICs, clearly visualizing the winding structure around V points, the generation and evolution of chiral C points. This work provides a universal approach for characterizing topological photonic systems via coherent nonlinearity processes, opening new avenues for studying topological phenomena in non-Hermitian photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Broadly Tunable Quantum Enhanced Raman Microscopy for Advancing Bioimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy has emerged as a powerful technique for probing the spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular bonds with exceptional sensitivity, resolution, and speed. However, classically, its performance remains fundamentally constrained by optical shot noise, which imposes a strict limit on detection sensitivity and speed. Here, we demonstrate a quantum-enhanced SRS microscopy platform that circumvents this barrier by harnessing amplitude-squeezed light. Specifically, we generate a Stokes beam with $5.2~\mathrm{dB}$ of amplitude squeezing using traveling-wave optical parametric amplification in second-order nonlinear waveguides, and combine it with a tunable coherent pump to access vibrational modes spanning from $1000$ to $3100~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Applied to quantum imaging of metabolites in biological tissue (pork muscle), our quantum-enhanced Raman microscope achieves an average noise suppression of $3.6~\mathrm{dB}$ and a $51\%$ enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) -- to the best of our knowledge, the largest improvement reported to date in quantum-enhanced SRS microscopy of biological samples.</description>

      <title>SOI-Compatible Degenerate Band Edge Photonic Structure: Design Rules and Robustness Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical periodic structures exhibiting a degenerate band edge (DBE) are of significant interest for various applications such as switching, sensing, high-power amplification, and lasing. At the edge of the bandgap in such structures, a fourth-order exceptional point degeneracy arises, leading to an extremely flat dispersion band. We propose and study a Silicon-on-Insulator-compatible structure composed of two coupled waveguides with asymmetric gratings. The dispersion relations and the field profiles are obtained using three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations, and we provide a set of practical guidelines for the design and optimization of such structures, in order to obtain a DBE. We analyze the transmission and reflection spectra of finite-size devices, and investigate their spectral properties near the stationary points. The scaling of the resonance quality factor with the number of unit cells is studied, revealing a performance that surpasses that of conventional periodic structures. Finally, we examine the robustness of the DBE with respect to fabrication tolerances and structural imperfections.</description>

      <title>Photonic Doping of Epsilon-Near-Zero Bragg Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) photonics provides a unique route to extreme dispersion, strong field confinement, and unconventional wave phenomena. Among its most intriguing concepts is photonic doping, where subwavelength dielectric inclusions embedded in ENZ media unlock exotic responses such as perfect magnetic conductor behavior and simultaneous epsilon-and-mu-near-zero properties. While prior demonstrations of photonic doping have been limited to microwave and far-infrared domains due to material losses, we demonstrate the feasibility of photonic doping at optical frequencies. Specifically, we implement photonic doping by embedding nanoparticle Mie resonators into an ultra-low-loss, all-dielectric ENZ platform realized with near-cutoff Bragg-reflection microcavities. We reveal the emergence of hybrid Bragg-Mie, near-zero-index modes whose fields localize within or between the nanoparticles. These modes exhibit substantially higher quality (Q) and Purcell factors than either the standalone nanoparticle array or the bare cavity. This mechanism enables the formation of highly isolated, spectrally pure electric and magnetic modes with dipolar or multipolar character. In representative photonically doped Bragg cavities, we predict Q factors on the order of 10000 and magnetic-dipole Purcell factors exceeding 4000 in the near-infrared region, associated with strong and high-Q magnetic hot spots localized within the nanoparticles. These results establish photonic doping of ENZ Bragg cavities as a powerful paradigm for achieving ultra-narrow-bandwidth, pure electric or magnetic Mie resonances, with exceptional potential for low-threshold nonlinear optics, magnetic dipole spectroscopy in atomic systems, and strong quantum optical light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Topological Expansion of Boehm's Brushes via Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a novel entoptic phenomenon in which the classical two-lobed Boehm's brushes are transformed into a multi-lobed structure by projecting spin-orbit coupled light onto the human retina. These structured beams, composed of non-separable superpositions of circular polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM), produce azimuthally modulated entoptic patterns through polarization-dependent scattering in the retina. Unlike Haidinger's brushes, which arise from dichroic absorption in the macula, the observed effect is driven by angular variations in scattering strength relative to the local polarization direction. In regions where scattering centers exhibit polarization orientations that converge toward a common point, their combined contributions reinforce one another, producing brighter and more sharply defined entoptic lobes whose number and orientation vary systematically with the topology of the spin-orbit stimulus. Psychophysical measurements across retinal eccentricities from 0.5$^\circ$ to 4$^\circ$ in eleven participants revealed that contrast detection thresholds decreased exponentially with eccentricity, consistent with polarization-sensitive scattering by isotropic structures in the non-foveal retinal regions. From the psychophysical fits, the mean eccentricity at which the entoptic pattern reached a 50 % threshold was $r_{50} = 1.03^\circ$ with a 95 % confidence interval of [0.72, 1.34]$^\circ$, indicating that the spin-orbit-induced entoptic structure becomes perceptually robust at approximately 1$^\circ$ retinal eccentricity. Together, these findings demonstrate that spin-orbit light modulates scattering-based visual phenomena in previously unrecognized ways, enabling new approaches for probing retinal structure and visual processing using topological features of light.</description>

      <title>Topological Soliton Frequency Comb in Nanophotonic Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized metrology, ranging, and optical clocks, which have motivated substantial efforts on the development of chip-scale comb sources. The on-chip comb sources are currently based on electro-optic modulation, mode-locked lasers, quantum cascade lasers, or soliton formation via Kerr nonlinearity. However, the widespread deployment of on-chip comb sources has remained elusive as they still require RF sources, high-Q resonators, or complex stabilization schemes while facing efficiency challenges. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip source of frequency comb based on the integration of a lithium niobate nanophotonic circuit with a semiconductor laser that can alleviate these challenges. For the first time, we show the formation of temporal topological solitons in a on-chip nanophotonic parametric oscillator with quadratic nonlinearity and low finesse. These solitons, independent of the dispersion regime, consist of phase defects separating two $\pi$-out-of-phase continuous wave solutions at the signal frequency, which is at half the input pump frequency. We use on-chip cross-correlation for temporal measurements and confirm formation of topological solitons as short as 60 fs around 2 $\mu$m, in agreement with a generalized parametrically forced Ginzburg-Landau theory. Moreover, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept turn-key operation of a hybrid-integrated source of topological frequency comb. Topological solitons offer a new paradigm for integrated comb sources, which are dispersion-sign agnostic and do not require high-Q resonators or high-speed modulators and can provide access to hard-to-access spectral regions, including mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>Observation of Ion-wave Satellites to Laser Harmonics in Intense Picosecond Laser-Solid Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detailed spectra of harmonics produced from ultra-intense, sub-picosecond, high-contrast laser pulses incident on solid targets have shown the first observation of regular red- and blue-shifted satellites. Their frequency shift is slightly less than the frequency of a nominal, pure ion-plasma wave associated with electron critical density, where an ion-acoustic wave would be expected. We explain this as the result of a substantial reduction of Debye shielding as the intense optical fields compete to drive electrons in large-amplitude oscillations. This general effect leads to a larger, dynamical and anisotropic Debye length, which should have a broad impact on plasma physics in this regime.</description>

      <title>Free-space multi-user quantum network with high key rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00466v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent quantum networks are the essential ingredient for securely connecting multiple users worldwide, extensively deployed in both fibre and free-space. An essential element is the multiplexing of entanglement to multiple users, overcoming the peer-to-peer restriction of quantum key distribution (QKD), so far successfully shown in fibre-based architectures. Here, we demonstrate a free-space quantum space division multiplexing architecture using just one entanglement source to realise a fully connected twelve-channel quantum network for seamless QKD connections between six users. The network achieves record coincidence rates exceeding $3 \times 10^{4}$ s$^{-1}$ between any pair of nodes on the network, for sifted key rate of over 400 kbps. Our approach overcomes the active switching hurdle that has hindered the free-space deployment of quantum multiplexing, is fully passive, easily scalable to more nodes and compatible with fibre-based integration, thus opening a new path to scalable and resource-efficient quantum networks that utilise free-space links.</description>

      <title>Polarization-sensitive GeSn Mid-Infrared Membrane Photodetectors with Integrated Plasmonic Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium-Tin (GeSn) semiconductors are promising for mid-infrared optoelectronics owing to their silicon compatibility, tunable bandgap, and potential for room-temperature operation. Released GeSn membranes provide an additional degree of freedom to extend the operation wavelength through epitaxial strain relaxation, while their transferability expands design flexibility. On the other hand, metasurfaces have become an effective strategy to engineer light--matter interaction, and their integration with photodetectors can enhance performance and introduce new functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a mid-infrared photodetector consisting of a transfer-printed Ge$_{0.89}$Sn$_{0.11}$ membrane integrated with an Au plasmonic metasurface. The photodetector exhibits a wavelength cutoff exceeding 3.0~$\mu$m with nearly fourfold increase in responsivity at 2.5~$\mu$m as compared to unreleased films, attributed to Fabry--P\'erot resonance. Furthermore, the integration with an anisotropic metasurface yields detectors with strong polarization sensitivity, achieving a measured contrast ratio of $\sim$4:1 between orthogonal polarizations. Moreover, the operation wavelength of the photodetector can be selectively tuned by varying the geometric scale of the metasurface. The experimental results show excellent agreement with simulations, confirming the effectiveness and versatility of this integrated metasurface--membrane design.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic multigrid solver for partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations is crucial to analysing and predicting complex, large-scale physical systems but pushes conventional high-performance computers to their limits. Application specific photonic processors are an exciting computing paradigm for building efficient, ultrafast hardware accelerators. Here, we investigate the synergy between multigrid based partial differential equations solvers and low latency photonic matrix vector multipliers. We propose a mixed-precision photonic multigrid solver, that offloads the computationally demanding smoothening procedure to the optical domain. We test our approach on an integrated photonic accelerator operating at 2 GSPS solving a Poisson and Schr\"odinger equation. By offloading the smoothening operation to the photonic system, we can reduce the digital operation by more than 80%. Finally, we show that the photonic multigrid solver potentially reduces digital operations by up to 97 % in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations, enabling an order-of-magnitude gain in computational speed and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved reconstruction of single-photon emitter locations from $g^{(2)}(0)$ maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are vital for emerging quantum technologies. In particular, Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising due to their room-temperature stability, long spin coherence, and compatibility with nanophotonic structures. A key challenge, however, is the reliable identification of isolated NV centers, since conventional confocal microscopy is diffraction-limited and cannot resolve emitter distributions within a focal spot. Besides, the associated intensity scanning is a time-expensive procedure. Here, we introduce a raster-scanned $g^{(2)}(0)$ mapping technique combined with an inversion-based reconstruction algorithm. By directly measuring local photon antibunching across the field of view, we extract the effective emitter number within each focal spot and reconstruct occupancy maps on a sub-focal-spot grid. This enables recovery of the number and spatial distribution of emitters within regions smaller than the confocal focal spot, thereby offering possibilities of going beyond the diffraction limit. Our simulations confirm robust reconstruction of NV-center distributions. The method provides a practical diagnostic tool for locating single-photon sources in an efficient and accurate manner, at much lesser time and effort compared to conventional intensity scanning. It offers valuable feedback for nanophotonic device fabrication, supporting more precise and scalable integration of NV-based quantum photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: A briefly formulated update of the recently published review [1] on the topic of multidimensional solitons (chiefly, in nonlinear optics and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)) is presented. The update briefly summarizes some notable results on this topic that have been reported very recently, and offers a compact outline of the directions of the current experiment and theoretical work in this and related fields. In particular, as concerns newest experimental findings, included are the creation of multiple quantum droplets in prolate BEC, and the observation of expanding toroidal light structures in linear optics. The update of theoretical results includes the analysis of 2D solitons in the optical system with the quadratic nonlinearity and fractional diffraction, and the prediction of stable 3D vortex solitons in various BEC schemes with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Framework for In Silico Thrombus Generation and Photoacoustic Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thrombus microstructure plays a critical role in determining the treatment success for thrombus-related diseases such as stroke and deep vein thrombosis. However, no in vivo diagnostic method can fully capture thrombus microstructure yet. Photoacoustic imaging is uniquely positioned to provide information on thrombi composition as it relays optical absorption information from diffuse photons at acoustic propagation depths. Computational modeling enables systematic exploration of microstructural effects on imaging signals, offering insights into developing improved in vivo diagnostic techniques. However, no photoacoustic simulation platform can model microstructural features within centimeter-scale phantoms at reasonable computational cost. Here, we present REFINE, a topology-driven framework for generating in silico thrombi replicating its key replicating their key microstructural traits. REFINE enables controlled, recursive optimization of thrombus topology, making it suitable for accurate photoacoustic modeling and potentially powerful for biomechanical analyses. These digital thrombi are embedded into a multiscale photoacoustic simulation platform that bridges microscale acoustic modeling with macroscale thrombus geometries, enabling efficient and realistic simulation of photoacoustic signal responses. We created unique thrombi microstructure for various compositions and porosities. Our simulation framework effectively links microstructural features to macroscale imaging outcomes, in agreement with previous empirical studies. Our results demonstrate that thrombus microstructure significantly affects photoacoustic spectral responses and can be modeled in silico. These findings highlight that multiscale photoacoustic simulation is a powerful tool for characterizing tissue microstructure and that our framework enables in silico thrombi analysis and diagnostic imaging strategy development</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity and security of entanglement-based QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyse the relation between non-Gaussianity and security of entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, namely device-independent (DI) and entanglement-based BB$84$. A similar analysis has already been made for prepare-and-measure (P\&amp;M) protocols \cite{Lasota2017}. In addition, we consider imperfect detection with dark counts and limited efficiency. We assume a perfect source of entangled Bell states as produced by quantum-dot type sources, depolarisation in the channel and different noise statistics, namely thermal and Poissonian. We consider single-photon avalanche photodiodes (SPAD) and photon number resolving detectors (PNRD) and use their respective criteria for non-Gaussianity. The results show cross-regions for both security and non-Gaussianity, hence, the possibility to conclude about the suitability of a given channel for secret key distribution. Our results can be useful as a pre-check for the implementation of QKD protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic crystal fibres (PCFs) are optical fibres that guide light using a modulated dielectric medium. They provide an exceptionally versatile platform for various applications, thanks to the flexibility with which light-guiding can be customised by modifying the fibre geometry. Here, we realise a PCF with guided modes produced by photonic bandstructure topology rather than conventional mode-trapping mechanisms. The design, which is compatible with the stack-and-draw fabrication process, consists of a cross-sectional photonic topological crystalline insulator with a disclination. A bulk-defect correspondence produces degenerate topological modes, lying below the cladding light line. We use various theoretical methods to confirm their topological origins, including a spectral localiser that makes minimal assumptions about the bandstructure. Our experiments on the fabricated topological fibre show it transmitting visible to near-infrared light with low losses of 10--20 dB/km, which do not increase much when the fibre is bent. A comparable solid-core PCF of conventional design exhibits substantially higher bending losses. Optical fibres based on topological modes thus hold promise for improved performance and novel functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping enables precise control of light propagation through multimode fibers (MMFs), facilitating diffraction-limited focusing for applications such as high-resolution single-fiber imaging and high-power fiber amplifiers. While the theoretical intensity enhancement at the focal point is dictated by the number of input degrees of freedom, practical constraints-such as phase-only modulation and experimental noise-impose significant limitations. Despite its importance, the upper bounds of enhancement under these constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to predict the fundamental limits of intensity enhancement with phase-only modulation in the presence of noise-induced phase errors, and we experimentally demonstrate wavefront shaping that approaches these limits. Our experimental results confirm an enhancement factor of 5000 in a large-core MMF, approaching the theoretical upper bound, enabled by noise-tolerant wavefront shaping. These findings provide key insights into the limits of phase-only control in MMFs, with profound implications for single-fiber imaging, optical communication, high-power broad-area fiber amplification, and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular fluorescence microscopy is a leading approach to super-resolution and nanoscale imaging in life and material sciences. However, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is often bottlenecked by system-specific calibrations and long acquisitions of sparsely blinking molecules. We present a deep-learning approach that reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single diffraction-limited camera frame. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic data encompassing a wide range of optical and sample parameters, enabling robust generalization across microscopes and experimental conditions. Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization ability of the developed model and its resilience across a broad range of noise levels, numerical apertures, and optical aberrations. By delivering unprecedented details from a single short camera exposure without prior information and calibration, our approach enables plug-and-play super-resolution imaging of fast, dense, or light-sensitive samples on standard wide-field setups.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Characterization of Materials' Plasmonic Properties using Fabry-Perot Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00521</link>

Abstract: Accurate characterization of plasmonic materials' dispersion and efficiency remains a key challenge for next-generation nanophotonic devices. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the plasmon dispersion relation at a metal-dielectric interface can be reconstructed from the resonance peaks of transmission spectra obtained in a series of extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) experiments on plasmonic gratings. A proof-of-concept of direct E-k dispersion mapping is numerically implemented by systematically varying the grating's unit cell size, with each grating serving as a discrete probe in momentum space. The resulting plasmon dispersion curves are derived from the frequencies of Fabry-Perot (FP) resonances localized within subwavelength apertures, scaled by a correction factor that accounts for the interplay between the resonant mechanisms driving enhanced transmission. This factor highlights the aperture's role in mode confinement and resonance shifting, which we examine in both idealized perfect electric conductor (PEC) and realistic dispersive metal regimes. To elucidate eigenstates of the plasmonic system and quantify the modal hybridization within its apertures, we perform a non-Hermitian modal decomposition using the finite element method (FEM) and corroborate it with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. The proposed framework enables an angle-insensitive, real-time, and in-situ characterization platform suitable for wafer-scale evaluation of established and emerging plasmonic materials.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh\,day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2\,m-class phased array at 1064\,nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6--0.8\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ to a 1\,m$^2$ receiver (about 28\,W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$\,kW delivers $\sim$30--50\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

      <title>Probing the collective excitations of excitonic insulators in an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The light--matter interaction in optical cavities offers a promising ground to create hybrid states and manipulate material properties. In this work, we examine the effect of light-matter coupling in the excitonic insulator phase using a quasi one-dimensional lattice model with two opposite parity orbitals at each site. We show that the model allows for a coupling between the collective phase mode and cavity photons. Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter interaction on photon propagation in the presence of excitonic collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Monitoring microplastics in live reef-building corals with microscopic laser particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20014v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micro- and nanoplastics pose a growing threat to marine organisms, such as reef-building corals. Yet, our understanding of microplastic uptake, interaction with coral tissue, and incorporation into coral skeletons remains limited, mainly due to the invasiveness of existing methods for detecting microplastics. Here, we exploit optical resonances in polymer spheres to transform microplastic particles into microscopic lasers. The bright, distinctive, and stable spectral signatures emitted by the microscopic laser particles function as optical barcodes, allowing extended tracking of microplastics transport through optically opaque coral tissue. Simultaneously, the lasers provide real-time sensing of dynamic changes at the microplastic surface with nanoscale resolution. Using confocal hyperspectral imaging, we establish the technical and analytical framework to capture coral anatomy and combine tracking and surface sensing into an integrated, non-invasive approach. With this, we explore the transport and internalization of individual microplastics in live corals, opening new avenues for understanding their ecological impact.</description>

      <title>Bipartite entanglement extracted from multimode squeezed light generated in lossy waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entangled two-mode Gaussian states constitute an important building block for continuous variable quantum computing and communication protocols. In this work, we theoretically study two-mode bipartite states which are extracted from multimode light generated via type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) in lossy waveguides. For these states, we demonstrate that the squeezing quantifies entanglement and we construct a measurement basis which results in the maximal bipartite entanglement. We illustrate our findings by numerically solving the spatial master equation for PDC in a Markovian environment. The optimal measurement modes are compared with two widely-used broadband bases: the Mercer-Wolf basis (the first-order coherence basis) and the Williamson-Euler basis.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Propagation of intense squeezed vacuum light in non-linear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on the microscopic interaction with a single atom, neglecting the crucial macroscopic aspect of light propagation through the media. This raises a key question: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media and how this affects the generation of non-linear optical signals? We address this question by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media. We find that atomic ionization caused by strong BSV fluctuations and the associated infrared photon losses introduce decoherence effects that can substantially limit the propagation length in the medium, reduce the harmonic yield, and decrease the number of emitted harmonics at high intensities. However, these effects are not detrimental. We identify conditions under which propagation-induced decoherence is minimized while the generated harmonics remain clearly detectable--an issue of particular importance for future studies exploring the connection between strong-field physics and quantum optics. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation through all states of matter in a fully quantized framework.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>
