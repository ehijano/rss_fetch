      <title>Testing the standardizability of, and deriving cosmological constraints from, a new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst data compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data to simultaneously constrain Amati correlation parameters and cosmological parameters in six spatially-flat and nonflat dark energy cosmological models, we show that an updated 220 GRB version of the Jia et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 516, 2575 (2022)] GRB data compilation are standardizable through the Amati correlation and so can be used for cosmological analyses. However, the resulting GRB data constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter, $\Omega_{m0}$, are in $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most of the cosmological models we consider, indicating that these GRB data cannot be jointly used with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO data to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Mounds: towards a realistic description of dark matter overdensities around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter overdensities around black holes can be searched for by looking at the characteristic imprint they leave on the gravitational waveform of binary black hole mergers. Current theoretical predictions of the density profile of dark matter overdensities are based on highly idealised formation scenarios, in which black holes are assumed to grow adiabatically from an infinitesimal seed to their final mass, compressing dark matter cusps at the center of galactic halos into very dense `spikes'. These scenarios were suitable for dark matter indirect detection studies, since annihilating dark matter cannot reach very high densities, but they fail to capture the dark matter distribution in the innermost regions where the gravitational wave signal is produced. We present here a more realistic formation scenario where black holes form from the collapse of supermassive stars, and follow the evolution of the dark matter density as the supermassive star grows and collapses to a black hole. We show that in this case dark matter forms shallower `mounds', instead of `spikes', on scales comparable with the size of the supermassive stars originating them. We discuss the implications for the detectability of these systems.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on future rip scenarios with holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>

      <title>Relation between the local width and linear halo mass density of cosmic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale cosmic filaments may have played an important role in shaping the properties of galaxies. Meanwhile, cosmic filaments are believed to harbor a substantial portion of the missing baryons at redshift z &lt; 2. To inspect the role of filaments in these issues, many properties of filaments need to be examined, including their lengths, thicknesses, and density profiles. However, measuring some of these properties poses challenges. This study concentrates on estimating filament width/thickness, investigating potential correlations between the local width of filaments and the properties of dark matter halos within filaments. We find that the local width of filaments generally increases with the mass of dark matter halos embedded in filaments per unit length, roughly following a secondorder polynomial, although with notable scatter. We probe and discuss means that may refine our findings. After further verification and improvements, this relation could be applied to filament samples constructed from the observed galaxy distribution, aiding in understanding the roles of cosmic filaments in galaxy evolution and uncovering the missing baryons.</description>

      <title>Investigating Cosmic Homogeneity Using Multi-fractal Analysis of the SDSS-IV eBOSS DR16 Quasar Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the volume-limited subsamples extracted from the sixteenth data release of the SDSS-IV eBOSS quasar survey spanning a redshift interval of $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.2$, to estimate the scale of transition to homogeneity in the Universe. The multi-fractal analysis used for this purpose considers the scaling behavior of different moments of quasar distribution in different density environments. This analysis gives the spectrum of generalized dimension $D_q$, where positive values of $q$ characterize the scaling behavior in over-dense regions and the negative ones in under-dense regions. We expect fractal correlation dimension $D_q(r) = 3$, for a homogeneous, random point distribution in 3-Dimensions. The fractal correlation dimension $D_q(r)$, corresponding to $q=2$ obtained in our study stabilizes in the range (2.8-2.9) for scales $r&gt;80$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The observed quasar distribution shows consistency with the simulated mock data and the random distribution of quasars within one sigma. Further, the generalized dimension spectrum $D_q(r)$ also reveals transition to homogeneity beyond $&gt;110$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, and the dominance of clustering at small scales $r&lt;80$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Consequently, our study provides strong evidence for the homogeneity in SDSS quasar distribution, offering insights into large-scale structure properties and, thus can play a pivotal role in scrutinizing the clustering properties of quasars and its evolution in various upcoming surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).</description>

      <title>Disentangling modified gravity from a dark force with gravitational redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach to test for deviations from General Relativity on cosmological scales is to combine measurements of the growth rate of structure with gravitational lensing. In this study, we show that this method suffers from an important limitation with regard to these two probes: models of dark matter with additional interactions can lead to the very same observational signatures found in modified gravity (and viceversa). Using synthetic data of redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background, we demonstrate that this degeneracy is inevitable between modifications of gravity and a dark fifth force. We then show that the coming generation of surveys, in particular the Square Kilometer Array, will allow us to break the degeneracy between such models through measurements of gravitational redshift. Performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the synthetic data set, we quantify the extent to which gravitational redshift can distinguish between two representative classes of models, Generalized Brans-Dicke (modified gravity) and Coupled Quintessence (fifth force).</description>

      <title>Systematic Effects in Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing with DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey will measure spectroscopic redshifts for millions of galaxies across roughly $14,000 \, \mathrm{deg}^2$ of the sky. Cross-correlating targets in the DESI survey with complementary imaging surveys allows us to measure and analyze shear distortions caused by gravitational lensing in unprecedented detail. In this work, we analyze a series of mock catalogs with ray-traced gravitational lensing and increasing sophistication to estimate systematic effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing estimators such as the tangential shear $\gamma_{\mathrm{t}}$ and the excess surface density $\Delta\Sigma$. We employ mock catalogs tailored to the specific imaging surveys overlapping with the DESI survey: the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey, and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). Among others, we find that fiber incompleteness can have significant effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing estimators but can be corrected effectively by up-weighting DESI targets with fibers by the inverse of the fiber assignment probability. Similarly, we show that intrinsic alignment and lens magnification are expected to be statistically significant given the precision forecasted for the DESI year-1 data set. Our study informs several analysis choices for upcoming cross-correlation studies of DESI with DES, HSC, and KiDS.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Cosmological Parameter Inference from Dark Matter Halo Density Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (lCNN) to estimate cosmological parameters from simulated three-dimensional DM halo distributions and associated statistics. The training dataset comprises 2000 realizations of a cubic box with a side length of 1000 $h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, and interpolated over a cubic grid of $300^3$ voxels, with each simulation produced using $512^3$ DM particles and $512^3$ neutrinos . Under the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, simulations vary standard six cosmological parameters including $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $w$, along with the neutrino mass sum, $M_\nu$. We find that: 1) within the framework of lCNN, extracting large-scale structure information is more efficient from the halo density field compared to relying on the statistical quantities including the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, and the coefficients from wavelet scattering transform; 2) combining the halo density field with its Fourier transformed counterpart enhances predictions, while augmenting the training dataset with measured statistics further improves performance; 3) achieving high accuracy in inferring $\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sigma_8$ by the neural network model, while being inefficient in predicting $\Omega_b$,$M_\nu$ and $w$; 4) compared to the simple random forest network trained with three statistical quantities, lCNN yields unbiased estimations with reduced statistical errors: approximately 33.3\% for $\Omega_m$, 20.0\% for $h$, 8.3\% for $n_s$, and 40.0\% for $\sigma_8$. Our study emphasizes this lCNN-based novel approach in extracting large-scale structure information and estimating cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Quasar Microlensing Statistics and Flux-Ratio Anomalies in Lens Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise lens modeling is a critical step in time delay studies of multiply imaged quasars, which are key for measuring some important cosmological parameters (specially $H_0$). However, lens models (in particular those semi-automatically generated) often show discrepancies with the observed flux-ratios between the different quasar images. These flux-ratio anomalies are usually explained through differential effects between images (mainly microlensing) that alter the intrinsic magnification ratios predicted by the models. To check this hypothesis, we collect direct measurements of microlensing to obtain the histogram of microlensing magnifications. We compare this histogram with recently published model flux-ratio anomalies and conclude that they cannot be statistically explained by microlensing. The average value of the model anomalies ($0.74\,$magnitudes) significantly exceeds the mean impact of microlensing ($0.33\,$magnitudes). Moreover, the histogram of model anomalies presents a significant tail with high anomalies ($|\Delta m| \ge 0.7$ magnitudes) which is completely unexpected from the statistics of microlensing observations. Microlensing simulations neither predict the high mean nor the fat tail of the histogram of model anomalies. We perform several statistical tests which exclude that microlensing can explain the observed flux-ratio anomalies (although Kolmogorov-Smirnov, which is less sensitive to the tail of the distributions, is not always conclusive). Thus, microlensing cannot statistically explain the bulk of flux-ratio anomalies, and models may explore different alternatives to try to reduce them. In particular, we propose to complement photometric observations with accurate flux ratios of the broad emission lines obtained from integral field spectroscopy to check and, ideally, constrain lens models.</description>

      <title>The Quasar Catalogue for S-PLUS DR4 (QuCatS) and the estimation of photometric redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of massive broad-band photometric surveys enabled photometric redshift estimates for unprecedented numbers of galaxies and quasars. These estimates can be improved using better algorithms or by obtaining complementary data such as narrow-band photometry, and broad-band photometry over an extended wavelength range. We investigate the impact of both approaches on photometric redshifts for quasars using data from S-PLUS DR4, GALEX DR6/7, and unWISE in three machine learning methods: Random Forest (RF), FlexCoDE, and Bayesian Mixture Density Network (BMDN). Including narrow-band photometry improves the root-mean-square error by 11% in comparison to a model trained with only broad-band photometry. Narrow-band information only provided an improvement of 3.8% when GALEX and WISE colours were included. Thus narrow bands play a more important role for objects that do not have GALEX or WISE counterparts, which respectively makes 92% and 25% of S-PLUS data considered here. Nevertheless, the inclusion of narrow-band information provided better estimates of the probability density functions obtained with FlexCoDE and BMDN. We publicly release a value-added catalogue of photometrically-selected quasars with the photo-z predictions from all methods studied here. The catalogue provided with this work covers the S-PLUS DR4 area (~3000deg$^2$), containing 645 980, 244 912, 144 991 sources with the probability of being a quasar higher than, 80%, 90%, 95% up to r &lt; 21.3 and good photometry quality in the detection image. More quasar candidates can be retrieved from the S-PLUS database by considering less restrictive selection criteria.</description>

      <title>On the Galactic radio signal from stimulated decay of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13653v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the full-sky distribution of the radio emission from the stimulated decay of axions which are assumed to compose the dark matter in the Galaxy. Besides the constant extragalactic and CMB components, the decays are stimulated by a Galactic radio emission with a spatial distribution that we empirically determine from observations. We compare the diffuse emission to the counterimages of the brightest supernovae remnants, and take into account the effects of free-free absorption. We show that, if the dark matter halo is described by a cuspy NFW profile, the expected signal from the Galactic center is the strongest. Interestingly, the emission from the Galactic anti-center provides competitive constraints that do not depend on assumptions on the uncertain dark matter density in the inner region. Furthermore, the anti-center of the Galaxy is the brightest spot if the Galactic dark matter density follows a cored profile. The expected signal from stimulated decays of axions of mass $m _{a} \sim 10 ^{-6}$ eV is within reach of the Square Kilometer Array for an axion-photon coupling $g _{a\gamma} \gtrsim (2-3) \times 10 ^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries have emerged as a tool for developing viable and physically coherent models, particularly in scenarios incorporating a negative cosmological constant. This study demonstrates that when the bulk geometry accommodates a set of $10$ Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which operate on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (be they spacelike or timelike), it leads to the existence of two distinct families of five-dimensional spacetimes. These spacetimes represent the general solutions to the bulk field equations. An aspect of these models is the composition of their energy-momentum tensor, which includes two key components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure $p_{\parallel}$ aligned with the extra spatial dimension. This framework can be perceived as a $5D$ extension of the recently identified Spatially Inhomogeneous and Irrotational spacetimes. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the Randall-Sundrum theory. This exploration is essential for deepening our understanding of the role of higher dimensions in cosmological models.</description>

Abstract: To describe the dark side of the Universe, we adopt a novel approach where dark energy is explained as an electrically charged majority of dark matter. Dark energy, as such, does not exist. The Friedmann equation at the present time coincides with that in a conventional approach, although the cosmological "constant" in the Electromagnetic Accelerating Universe (EAU) Model shares a time dependence with the matter component. Its equation of state is $\omega \equiv P/\rho \equiv -1$ within observational accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now: both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the early epoch of the evolution. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this contribution. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary epoch and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of GUP distortion.</description>

      <title>The Physalis system: Discovery of ORC-like radio shells around a massive pair of interacting early-type galaxies with offset X-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of large radio shells around a massive pair of interacting galaxies and extended diffuse X-ray emission within the shells. The radio data were obtained with the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in two frequency bands centred at 944 MHz and 1.4 GHz, respectively, while the X-ray data are from the XMM-Newton observatory. The host galaxy pair, which consists of the early-type galaxies ESO 184-G042 and LEDA 418116, is part of a loose group at a distance of only 75 Mpc (redshift z = 0.017). The observed outer radio shells (diameter ~ 145 kpc) and ridge-like central emission of the system, ASKAP J1914-5433 (Physalis), are likely associated with merger shocks during the formation of the central galaxy (ESO 184-G042) and resemble the new class of odd radio circles (ORCs). This is supported by the brightest X-ray emission found offset from the centre of the Physalis system, instead centered at the less massive galaxy, LEDA 418116. The host galaxy pair is embedded in an irregular envelope of diffuse light, highlighting on-going interactions. We complement our combined radio and X-ray study with high-resolution simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxy mergers from the Magneticum project to analyse the evolutionary state of the Physalis system. We argue that ORCs / radio shells could be produced by a combination of energy release from the central AGN and subsequent lightening up in radio emission by merger shocks traveling through the CGM of these systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators with Double Massive Exchanges: Bootstrap Equation and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the recently developed cosmological bootstrap method, we compute the exact analytical solution for the seed integral appearing in cosmological correlators with double massive scalar exchanges. The result is explicit, valid in any kinematic configuration, and free from spurious divergences. It is applicable to any number of fields' species with any masses. With an appropriate choice of variables, the results contain only single-layer summations. We also propose simple approximate formulas valid in different limits, enabling direct and instantaneous evaluation.Supported by exact numerical results using CosmoFlow, we explore the phenomenology of double massive exchange diagrams. Contrary to single-exchange diagrams with ubiquitous Lorentz-covariant interactions, the size of the cubic coupling constant can be large while respecting perturbativity bounds. Because of this property, the primordial bispectrum from double-exchange diagrams can be as large as, coincidentally, current observational constraints. In addition to being sizable on equilateral configurations, we show that the primordial bispectrum exhibits a large cosmological collider signal in the squeezed limit, making the double massive exchanges interesting channels for the detection of massive primordial fields. We propose to decisively disentangle double-exchange channels from single-exchange ones with cosmological observations by exploiting the phase information of the cosmological collider signal, the inflationary flavor oscillations from multiple fields' species exchanges and the double soft limit in the primordial trispectrum.</description>

      <title>Exploring field-evolution and dynamical-capture coalescing binary black holes in GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuously expanding sample of gravitational-wave observations is revealing the formation and evolutionary mechanism of merging compact binaries. Two primary channels, namely, isolated field binary evolution and dynamical capture, are widely accepted as potential producers of merging binary black holes (BBHs), which are distinguishable with the spin-orientation distributions of the BBHs. We investigate the two formation channels in GWTC-3, with a dedicated semi-parametric population model, i.e., a mixture of two sub-populations with different spin-orientation distributions (one is nearly-aligned and the other is nearly-isotropic). It turns out that the two sub-populations have different mass and mass-ratio distributions. The nearly-aligned sub-population, which is consistent with the isolated field formation channels, has a less preference for symmetric systems, and likely dominate the 10-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function. While the isotropic sub-population shows a stronger preference for symmetric systems, and mainly contribute to the 35-solar-mass peak in the primary-mass function, consistent with the dynamical channels. Moreover, our results show that the purely isotropic-spin and the single well-aligned (i.e., the width of $\cos\theta$ distribution $\sigma_{\rm t}&lt;0.5$) scenario are ruled out (by a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B}=5.2$ and $\ln\mathcal{B}=9.8$).</description>

      <title>Finding Lensed Radio Sources with the VLA Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio observations of strongly lensed objects are valuable as cosmological probes. Lensed radio sources have proven difficult to identify in large part due to the limited depth and angular resolution of the previous generation of radio sky surveys, and as such, only a few dozen lensed radio sources are known. In this work we present the results of a pilot study using the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) in combination with optical data to more efficiently identify lensed radio sources. We obtain high-resolution (0.2") VLA follow-up observations for 11 targets that we identify using three different techniques: i) a search for compact radio sources offset from galaxies with high lensing potential, ii) VLASS detections of known lensed galaxies, iii) VLASS detections of known lensed quasars. 5 of our targets show radio emission from the lensed images, including 100% of the lensed optical quasar systems. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining deep and high-resolution wide-area radio and optical survey data to efficiently find lensed radio sources, and we discuss the potential impact of such an approach using next-generation surveys with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Dark matter solution to the $H_{0}$ and $S_{8}$ tensions, and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe void anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a phenomenological model of dark matter with an equation-of-state $w$ that is negative and changing at late times. We show this couples the $H_{0}$ and $S_{8}$ tensions, alleviating them both simultaneously, reducing the $H_{0}$ tension from $\sim5\sigma$ to $\sim3\sigma$ and the $S_{8}$ tension from $\sim3\sigma$ to $\sim1\sigma$. Furthermore, the model provides an explanation for the anomalously large integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from cosmic voids, a unique consequence of the changing and negative equation-of-state. Observations of high ISW from cosmic voids may therefore be evidence that dark matter plays a significant role in both the $H_{0}$ and $S_{8}$ tensions. We predict the ISW from cosmic voids to be a factor of up to $\sim2$ greater in this model than what is expected from the standard model $\Lambda$CDM. These results extend to other degenerate models of dark matter, such as unified or interacting dark matter and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Role of Future SNIa Data from Rubin LSST in Reinvestigating Cosmological Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how future Type-Ia supernovae (SNIa) standard candles detected by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) can constrain some cosmological models. We use a realistic three-year SNIa simulated dataset generated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Time Domain pipeline, which includes a mix of spectroscopic and photometrically identified candidates. We combine this data with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements to estimate the dark energy model parameters for two models -- the baseline $\Lambda$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) dark energy parametrization. We compare them with the current constraints obtained from joint analysis of the latest real data from the Pantheon SNIa compilation, CMB from Planck 2018 and BAO. Our analysis finds tighter constraints on the model parameters along with a significant reduction of correlation between $H_0$ and $\sigma_{8,0}$. We find that LSST is expected to significantly improve upon the existing SNIa data in the critical analysis of cosmological models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We do a detailed analysis of a well-theoretically motivated interacting dark energy scalar field model with a time-varying interaction term. Using current cosmological datasets from CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers, angular diameter measurements from Megamasers, growth measurements, and local SH0ES measurements, we found that dark energy component may act differently than a cosmological constant at early times. The observational data also does not disfavor a small interaction between dark energy and dark matter at late times. When using all these datasets in combination, our value of $H_0$ agrees well with SH0ES results but in 2.5$\sigma$ tension with Planck results. We also did AIC and BIC analysis, and we found that the cosmological data prefer coupled quintessence model over $\Lambda$CDM, although the chi-square per number of degrees of freedom test prefers the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inflation is a highly favoured theory for the early Universe. It is compatible with current observations of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure and is a driver in the quest to detect primordial gravitational waves. It is also, given the current quality of the data, highly under-determined with a large number of candidate implementations. We use a new method in symbolic regression to generate all possible simple scalar field potentials for one of two possible basis sets of operators. Treating these as single-field, slow-roll inflationary models we then score them with an information-theoretic metric ("minimum description length") that quantifies their efficiency in compressing the information in current data. We explore two possible priors on the parameter space of potentials, one related to the functions' structural complexity and one that uses a Katz back-off language model to prefer functions that may be theoretically motivated. This enables us to identify the inflaton potentials that optimally balance simplicity with accuracy at explaining current data, which may subsequently find theoretical motivation. Our exploratory study opens the door to extraction of fundamental physics directly from data, and may be augmented with more refined theoretical priors in the quest for a complete understanding of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptive Graph Neural Networks for Constraining Cosmological Parameters Across Multiple Data Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to outperform methods that rely on summary statistics, like the power spectrum, in extracting information from complex cosmological data sets. However, due to differences in the subgrid physics implementation and numerical approximations across different simulation suites, models trained on data from one cosmological simulation show a drop in performance when tested on another. Similarly, models trained on any of the simulations would also likely experience a drop in performance when applied to observational data. Training on data from two different suites of the CAMELS hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, we examine the generalization capabilities of Domain Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (DA-GNNs). By utilizing GNNs, we capitalize on their capacity to capture structured scale-free cosmological information from galaxy distributions. Moreover, by including unsupervised domain adaptation via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), we enable our models to extract domain-invariant features. We demonstrate that DA-GNN achieves higher accuracy and robustness on cross-dataset tasks (up to $28\%$ better relative error and up to almost an order of magnitude better $\chi^2$). Using data visualizations, we show the effects of domain adaptation on proper latent space data alignment. This shows that DA-GNNs are a promising method for extracting domain-independent cosmological information, a vital step toward robust deep learning for real cosmic survey data.</description>

Abstract: We show that a mass-varying neutrino model driven by scalar field dark energy relaxes the existing upper bound on the current neutrino mass to ${\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.72}$ eV. We extend the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model by introducing two parameters: the rate of change of the scalar field with the number of $e$-folds and the coupling between neutrinos and the field. We investigate how they affect the matter power spectrum, the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and its lensing potential. The model is tested against Planck observations of temperature, polarization, and lensing, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements that constrain the background evolution. The results indicate that small couplings favor a cosmological constant, while larger couplings favor a dynamical dark energy, weakening the upper bound on current neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>A precise symbolic emulator of the linear matter power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters can be prohibitively slow in cosmological analyses, hence emulating this calculation is desirable. Previous analytic approximations are insufficiently accurate for modern applications, so black-box, uninterpretable emulators are often used. We utilise an efficient genetic programming based symbolic regression framework to explore the space of potential mathematical expressions which can approximate the power spectrum and $\sigma_8$. We learn the ratio between an existing low-accuracy fitting function for $P(k)$ and that obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations and thus still incorporate the physics which motivated this earlier approximation. We obtain an analytic approximation to the linear power spectrum with a root mean squared fractional error of 0.2% between $k = 9\times10^{-3} - 9 \, h{\rm \, Mpc^{-1}}$ and across a wide range of cosmological parameters, and we provide physical interpretations for various terms in the expression. Our analytic approximation is 950 times faster to evaluate than camb and 36 times faster than the neural network based matter power spectrum emulator BACCO. We also provide a simple analytic approximation for $\sigma_8$ with a similar accuracy, with a root mean squared fractional error of just 0.1% when evaluated across the same range of cosmologies. This function is easily invertible to obtain $A_{\rm s}$ as a function of $\sigma_8$ and the other cosmological parameters, if preferred. It is possible to obtain symbolic approximations to a seemingly complex function at a precision required for current and future cosmological analyses without resorting to deep-learning techniques, thus avoiding their black-box nature and large number of parameters. Our emulator will be usable long after the codes on which numerical approximations are built become outdated.</description>

      <title>Constraining general multi-field inflation using the SPHEREx all-sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how well the SPHEREx all-sky survey can constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity beyond the parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ using galaxy power spectra. We forecast joint constraints on the parameters $f_{\text{NL}}$, $g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$ obtained assuming a simple two-field curvaton model of inflation. The parameters $f_{\text{NL}}$ and $g_{\text{NL}}$ characterise the squeezed limits of the primordial bispectrum and trispectrum respectively, and lead to a characteristic scale-dependence of the galaxy bias that increases out to arbitrarily large scales. Values of the parameter $\tau_{\text{NL}}&gt; (\frac{6}{5}f_{\text{NL}})^{2}$ cause the galaxy power spectrum to have a stochastic component which also increases out to arbitrarily large scales. Our MCMC forecasts indicate that SPHEREx can provide joint constraints on any two of the three parameters $f_{\text{NL}}, \ g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$. Due to strong degeneracies among these parameters, measurements of the galaxy power spectra alone may not be sufficient to jointly constrain all three. Constraints on $f_{\text{NL}}, \ g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$ obtained from galaxy power spectrum observations depend on the modelling of underlying nuisance parameters. We study the robustness of our forecast constraints to modelling choices and note that even with relatively conservative modelling assumptions, SPHEREx galaxy power spectra can provide strong evidence of local non-Gaussianity, even if the particular values of $f_{\text{NL}}$ and $g_{\text{NL}}$ cannot be measured precisely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate evaluation of the nonlinear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters and redshift is of fundamental importance in cosmology. Analytic approximations provide an interpretable solution, yet current approximations are neither fast nor accurate relative to numerical emulators. We use symbolic regression to obtain simple analytic approximations to the nonlinear scale, $k_\sigma$, the effective spectral index, $n_{\rm eff}$, and the curvature, $C$, which are required for the halofit model. We then re-optimise the coefficients of halofit to fit a wide range of cosmologies and redshifts. We explore the space of analytic expressions to fit the residuals between $P(k)$ and the optimised predictions of halofit. Our results are designed to match the predictions of EuclidEmulator2, but are validated against $N$-body simulations. Our symbolic expressions for $k_\sigma$, $n_{\rm eff}$ and $C$ have root mean squared fractional errors of 0.8%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, for redshifts below 3 and a wide range of cosmologies. The re-optimised halofit parameters reduce the root mean squared fractional error (compared to EuclidEmulator2) from 3% to below 2% for wavenumbers $k=9\times10^{-3}-9 \, h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. We introduce syren-halofit (symbolic-regression-enhanced halofit), an extension to halofit containing a short symbolic correction which improves this error to 1%. Our method is 2350 and 3170 times faster than current halofit and hmcode implementations, respectively, and 2680 and 64 times faster than EuclidEmulator2 (which requires running class) and the BACCO emulator. We obtain comparable accuracy to EuclidEmulator2 and BACCO when tested on $N$-body simulations. Our work greatly increases the speed and accuracy of symbolic approximations to $P(k)$, making them significantly faster than their numerical counterparts without loss of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We present a superfluid dark star model consisting of relativistic dark bosons with two-body self-interaction. The obtained masses, radii, and tidal deformability depend in a simple way on the boson mass and interaction strength. We report first results on binary mergers: the distinctive amplitude and frequency of the emitted gravitational waves are well within reach of terrestrial interferometers.</description>

      <title>No need to know: astrophysics-free gravitational-wave cosmology</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging compact objects encode direct information about the luminosity distance to the binary. When paired with a redshift measurement, this enables standard-siren cosmology: a Hubble diagram can be constructed to directly probe the Universe's expansion. This can be done in the absence of electromagnetic measurements as features in the mass distribution of GW sources provide self-calibrating redshift measurements without the need for a definite or probabilistic host galaxy association. This technique has thus far only been applied with simple parametric representations of the mass distribution. However, the use of an inaccurate representation leads to biases in the cosmological inference, an acute problem given the current uncertainties in true source population. Furthermore, it is commonly presumed that the form of the mass distribution must be known a priori to obtain unbiased measurements of cosmological parameters in this fashion. Here, we demonstrate that spectral sirens can accurately infer cosmological parameters without such prior assumptions. We apply a flexible, non-parametric model for the mass distribution of compact binaries to a simulated catalog of 1,000 gravitational-wave events, consistent with expectations for the next LVK observing run. We find that, despite our model's flexibility, both the source mass model and cosmological parameters are correctly reconstructed. We predict a $5.8\%$ measurement of $H_0$, keeping all other cosmological parameters fixed, and a $6.4\%$ measurement of $H(z=0.9)$ when fitting for multiple cosmological parameters ($1\sigma$ uncertainties). This astrophysically-agnostic spectral siren technique will be essential to arrive at precise and unbiased cosmological constraints from GW source populations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reconstruction of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations for DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide a robust standard ruler to measure the expansion history of the Universe through galaxy clustering. Density-field reconstruction is now a widely adopted procedure for increasing the precision and accuracy of the BAO detection. With the goal of finding the optimal reconstruction settings to be used in the DESI 2024 galaxy BAO analysis, we assess the sensitivity of the post-reconstruction BAO constraints to different choices in our analysis configuration, performing tests on blinded data from the first year of DESI observations (DR1), as well as on mocks that mimic the expected clustering and selection properties of the DESI DR1 target samples. Overall, we find that BAO constraints remain robust against multiple aspects in the reconstruction process, including the choice of smoothing scale, treatment of redshift-space distortions, fiber assignment incompleteness, and parameterizations of the BAO model. We also present a series of tests that DESI followed in order to assess the maturity of the end-to-end galaxy BAO pipeline before the unblinding of the large-scale structure catalogs.</description>

      <title>HOD-Dependent Systematics in Emission Line Galaxies for the DESI 2024 BAO analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will provide precise measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to constrain the expansion history of the Universe and set stringent constraints on dark energy. Therefore, precise control of the global error budget due to various systematic effects is required for the DESI 2024 BAO analysis. In this work, we focus on the robustness of the BAO analysis against the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling for the Emission Line Galaxy (ELG) tracer. Based on a common dark matter simulation, our analysis relies on HOD mocks tuned to early DESI data, namely the One-Percent survey data. To build the mocks, we use several HOD models for the ELG tracer as well as extensions to the baseline HOD models. Among these extensions, we consider distinct recipes for galactic conformity and assembly bias. We perform two independent analyses in the Fourier space and in the configuration space. We recover the BAO signal from two-point measurements after performing reconstruction on our mocks. Additionally, we also apply the control variates technique to reduce sample variance noise. Our BAO analysis can recover the isotropic BAO parameter $\alpha_\text{iso}$ within 0.1\% and the Alcock Paczynski parameter $\alpha_\text{AP}$ within 0.3\%. Overall, we find that our systematic error due to the HOD dependence is below 0.17\%, with the Fourier space analysis being more robust against the HOD systematics. We conclude that our analysis pipeline is robust enough against the HOD systematics for the ELG tracer in the DESI 2024 BAO analysis.</description>

Abstract: We develop methods to extract key dark energy information from cosmic distance measurements including the BAO scales and supernovae luminosity distances. Demonstrated using simulated datasets of the complete DESI, LSST and Roman surveys designed for BAO and SNe distance measurements, we show that using our method, the dynamical behaviour of the energy, pressure, equation of state (with its time derivative) of dark energy and the cosmic deceleration function can all be accurately recovered from high-quality data, which allows for robust diagnostic tests for dark energy models.</description>

Abstract: We extract key information of dark energy from current observations of BAO, OHD and $H_0$, and find hints of dynamical behaviour of dark energy. In particular, a dynamical dark energy model whose equation of state crosses $-1$ is favoured by observations.

      <title>Comparing Compressed and Full-modeling Analyses with FOLPS: Implications for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will provide unprecedented information about the large-scale structure of our Universe. In this work, we study the robustness of the theoretical modelling of the power spectrum of FOLPS, a novel effective field theory-based package for evaluating the redshift space power spectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos. We perform this validation by fitting the AbacusSummit high-accuracy $N$-body simulations for Luminous Red Galaxies, Emission Line Galaxies and Quasar tracers, calibrated to describe DESI observations. We quantify the potential systematic error budget of FOLPS, finding that the modelling errors are fully sub-dominant for the DESI statistical precision within the studied range of scales. Additionally, we study two complementary approaches to fit and analyse the power spectrum data, one based on direct Full-Modelling fits and the other on the ShapeFit compression variables, both resulting in very good agreement in precision and accuracy. In each of these approaches, we study a set of potential systematic errors induced by several assumptions, such as the choice of template cosmology, the effect of prior choice in the nuisance parameters of the model, or the range of scales used in the analysis. Furthermore, we show how opening up the parameter space beyond the vanilla $\Lambda$CDM model affects the DESI observables. These studies include the addition of massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, and dark energy equation of state. We also examine how relaxing the usual Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis priors on the primordial spectral index and the baryonic matter abundance, respectively, impacts the inference on the rest of the parameters of interest. This paper pathways towards performing a robust and reliable analysis of the shape of the power spectrum of DESI galaxy and quasar clustering using FOLPS.</description>

      <title>A comparison of effective field theory models of redshift space galaxy power spectra for DESI 2024 and future surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In preparation for the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys, and in particular the year-one data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we investigate the consistency of a variety of effective field theory models that describe the galaxy-galaxy power spectra in redshift space into the quasi-linear regime using 1-loop perturbation theory. These models are employed in the pipelines \texttt{velocileptors}, \texttt{PyBird}, and \texttt{Folps$\nu$}. While these models have been validated independently, a detailed comparison with consistent choices has not been attempted. After briefly discussing the theoretical differences between the models we describe how to provide a more apples-to-apples comparison between them. We present the results of fitting mock spectra from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} suite of N-body simulations provided in three redshift bins to mimic the types of dark time tracers targeted by the DESI survey. We show that the theories behave similarly and give consistent constraints in both the forward-modeling and ShapeFit compressed fitting approaches. We additionally generate (noiseless) synthetic data from each pipeline to be fit by the others, varying the scale cuts in order to show that the models agree within the range of scales for which we expect 1-loop perturbation theory to be applicable. This work lays the foundation of Full-Shape analysis with DESI Y1 galaxy samples where in the tests we performed, we found no systematic error associated with the modeling of the galaxy redshift space power spectrum for this volume.</description>

      <title>Validating the Galaxy and Quasar Catalog-Level Blinding Scheme for the DESI 2024 analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of precision cosmology, ensuring the integrity of data analysis through blinding techniques is paramount -- a challenge particularly relevant for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). DESI represents a monumental effort to map the cosmic web, with the goal to measure the redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies and quasars. Given the data volume and the impact of the findings, the potential for confirmation bias poses a significant challenge. To address this, we implement and validate a comprehensive blind analysis strategy for DESI Data Release 1 (DR1), tailored to the specific observables DESI is most sensitive to: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) and primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). We carry out the blinding at the catalog level, implementing shifts in the redshifts of the observed galaxies to blind for BAO and RSD signals and weights to blind for PNG through a scale-dependent bias. We validate the blinding technique on mocks, as well as on data by applying a second blinding layer to perform a battery of sanity checks. We find that the blinding strategy alters the data vector in a controlled way such that the BAO and RSD analysis choices do not need any modification before and after unblinding. The successful validation of the blinding strategy paves the way for the unblinded DESI DR1 analysis, alongside future blind analyses with DESI and other surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DESI aims to provide one of the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters by analyzing the clustering of more than thirty million galaxies. However, obtaining such constraints requires special care in validating the analysis methods, and efforts to reduce the computational time required through techniques such as data compression and emulation. In this work, we perform a precision validation of the PyBird power spectrum modelling code with both a traditional, but emulated, Full-Modelling approach and the model-independent Shapefit compression approach. Using cubic simulations, which accurately reproduce the clustering and precision of the DESI survey, we find that the cosmological constraints from Shapefit and Full-Modelling are consistent with each other at the $\sim0.3\sigma$ level. Both Shapefit and Full-Modelling are also consistent with the true $\Lambda$CDM simulation cosmology, even when including the hexadecapole, down to a scale $k_{\mathrm{max}} = 0.20 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. For extended models such as the $w$CDM and the $o$CDM models, we find including the hexadecapole can significantly improve the constraints and reduce the systematic errors with the same $k_{\mathrm{max}}$. Furthermore, we also show that the constraints on cosmological parameters with the correlation function evaluated from PyBird down to $s_{\mathrm{min}} = 30 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$ are unbiased, and consistent with the constraints from the power spectrum.</description>

      <title>An analysis of parameter compression and full-modeling techniques with Velocileptors for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In anticipation of forthcoming data releases of current and future spectroscopic surveys, we present the validation tests and analysis of systematic effects within \texttt{velocileptors} modeling pipeline when fitting mock data from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} N-body simulations. We compare the constraints obtained from parameter compression methods to the direct fitting (Full-Modeling) approaches of modeling the galaxy power spectra, and show that the ShapeFit extension to the traditional template method is consistent with the Full-Modeling method within the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameter space. We show the dependence on scale cuts when fitting the different redshift bins using the ShapeFit and Full-Modeling methods. We test the ability to jointly fit data from multiple redshift bins as well as joint analysis of the pre-reconstruction power spectrum with the post-reconstruction BAO correlation function signal. We further demonstrate the behavior of the model when opening up the parameter space beyond $\Lambda$CDM and also when combining likelihoods with external datasets, namely the Planck CMB priors. Finally, we describe different parametrization options for the galaxy bias, counterterm, and stochastic parameters, and employ the halo model in order to physically motivate suitable priors that are necessary to ensure the stability of the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Bounds from multi-messenger astronomy on the Super Heavy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purely gravitational evidence supporting the need for dark matter (DM) particles is compelling and based on Galactic to cosmological scale observations. Thus far, the promising weakly interacting massive particles scenarios have eluded detection, motivating alternative models for DM. We consider the scenarios involving the superheavy dark matter (SHDM) that potentially can be emitted by primordial black holes (PBHs) and can decay or annihilate into ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrinos and photons. The observation of a population of photons with energies $E\ge 10^{11}$ GeV would imply the existence of completely new physical phenomena, or shed some light on DM models. Only the ultra-high energy cosmic ray observatories have the capabilities to detect such UHE decay products via the measurements of UHE photon induced extensive air showers. Using the upper bound on the flux of UHE cosmic rays beyond $10^{11.3}$ GeV implying $J(&gt;10^{11.3}~{\rm{GeV}})&lt; 3.6\times 10^{-5}$ km$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$y$^{-1}$, at the $90\%$ C.L. reported by the Pierre Auger Observatory, we obtain global limits on the lifetime of the DM particles with masses $10^{15}\le M_{X} \le 10^{17}$ GeV. The constraints derived here are new and cover a region of the parameter space not yet explored. We compare our results with the projected constraints from future POEMMA and JEM-EUSO experiments, in order to quantify the improvement that will be obtained by these missions.
  Moreover, assuming that an epoch of early PBHs domination introduces a unique spectral break, $f_{\ast}$, in the gravitational wave spectrum, the frequency of which is related to the SHDM mass, we map potential probes and limits of the DM particles masses on the $f_{\ast}-M_{X}$ parameter space.</description>

      <title>Holographic origin of TCC and the Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the unique features of quantum gravity is the lack of local observables and the completeness of boundary observables. We show that the existence of boundary observables for particles with mass $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m}{H}=\infty$ in scalar field cosmologies where $a(t)\sim t^{p}$ is equivalent to TCC, which implies $p\leq 1$. Moreover, the mass of weakly-coupled particles must decay like $m\lesssim t^{1-2p}$ to ensure that they yield non-trivial boundary observables. This condition can be expressed in terms of the scalar field that drives the cosmology as $m\lesssim\exp(-c\phi)$ where $c$ depends on the scalar potential. The strongest bound we find is achieved for $V\sim \exp(-2\phi/\sqrt{d-2})$ where $c=1/\sqrt{d-2}$. These results connect some of the most phenomenologically interesting Swampland conjectures to the most basic version of holography.</description>

      <title>Unimodular Proca Theory: Breaking the U(1) gauge symmetry of unimodular gravity via a mass term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian structure of unimodular-like theories, where the cosmological constant (or other supposed constants of nature) are demoted from fixed parameters to classical constants of motion. No new local degrees of freedom are present as a result of a $U(1)$ gauge invariance of the theory. Hamiltonian analysis of the action reveals that the only possible gauge fixing that can be enforced is setting the spatial components of the four-volume time vector ${\cal T}^{i}\approx0$. As a consequence of this, the gauge-fixed unimodular path integral is equivalent to the minisuperspace unimodular path integral. However, should we break the $U(1)$ gauge invariance, two things happen: a massless propagating degree of freedom appears, and the (gauge-invariant) zero-mode receives modified dynamics. The implications are investigated, with the phenomenology depending crucially on the target ``constant''.</description>

      <title>An Approximate Kerr-Newman-like Metric Endowed with a Magnetic Dipole and Mass Quadrupole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate all-terrain spacetimes for astrophysical applications are presented. The metrics possess five relativistic multipole moments, namely mass, rotation, mass quadrupole, charge, and magnetic dipole moment. All these spacetimes approximately satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell field equations. The first metric is generated by means of the Hoenselaers-Perj\'es method from given relativistic multipoles. The second metric is a perturbation of the Kerr-Newman metric, which makes it a relevant approximation for astrophysical calculations. The last metric is an extension of the Hartle-Thorne metric that is important for obtaining internal models of compact objects perturbatively. The electromagnetic field is calculated using Cartan forms for locally nonrotating observers. These spacetimes are relevant to infer properties of compact objects from astrophysical observations. Furthermore, the numerical implementations of these metrics are straightforward, making them versatile for simulating the potential astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>ALP-Assisted Strong First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition and Baryogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can be naturally lighter than the electroweak scale. We consider an ALP that couples to the Standard Model Higgs to achieve the strong first-order electroweak phase transition. We discuss the two-field dynamics of the phase transition and the associated computation in detail and identify the viable parameter space. The ALP mass can be from the MeV to GeV scale. Baryon asymmetry can be explained by local baryogenesis without violating the current electron and atom electric dipole moment bound in most of the viable parameter space. The viable parameter space can be probed through Higgs exotic decay, rare kaon decay, the electron and atomic electric dipole moment, and the effective number of neutrinos in the cosmic microwave background in the future. The gravitational-wave signal is too weak to be detected.</description>

      <title>Can we distinguish black holes with electric and magnetic charges from quasinormal modes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes (BHs) with electric and magnetic charges. For the electrically charged case, the dynamics of perturbations separates into the odd- and even-parity sectors with two coupled differential equations in each sector. In the presence of both electric and magnetic charges, the differential equations of four dynamical degrees of freedom are coupled with each other between odd- and even-parity perturbations. Despite this notable modification, we show that, for a given total charge and mass, a BH with mixed electric and magnetic charges gives rise to the same quasinormal frequencies for fundamental modes. This includes the case in which two BHs have equal electric and magnetic charges for each of them. Thus, the gravitational-wave observations of quasinormal modes during the ringdown phase alone do not distinguish between electrically and magnetically charged BHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of primordial black holes can be affected by the non-Gaussian statistics of the density fluctuations that generate them. Therefore, it is important to have good theoretical control of the higher-order correlation functions for primordial curvature perturbations. By working at leading order in a $1/|\eta|$ expansion, we analytically determine the bispectrum of curvature fluctuations for single field inflationary scenarios producing primordial black holes. The bispectrum has a rich scale and shape dependence, and its features depend on the dynamics of the would-be decaying mode. We apply our analytical results to study gravitational waves induced at second order by enhanced curvature fluctuations. Their statistical properties are derived in terms of convolution integrals over wide momentum ranges, and they are sensitive on the scale and shape dependence of the curvature bispectrum we analytically computed.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of a dark energy model in Rastall gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a cosmological model in Rastall's theory of gravity in the framework of the flat FLRW metric. We formulate the value of the Hubble parameter, which contains two model parameters, $ \alpha $ and $ j $. Employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, we determine the values of these model parameters along with their uncertainties. Moreover, we derive the equation of state (EoS) parameter, which converges around the quintessence region. We perform a dynamical system analysis using the linearization technique to validate the results independently. Also, we discuss various physical attributes of the model, highlighting the transition to acceleration and the violation of the strong energy condition (SEC) in the late stages of evolution. In conclusion, our model mimics the behavior of a dark matter fluid during the past epoch and transitions into a quintessence dark energy model in the future epoch.</description>

      <title>Falsifying Anthropics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since axion misalignment must be induced by Brownian drift in (quasi)de Sitter space, this could invalidate the anthropic prediction of the dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>
