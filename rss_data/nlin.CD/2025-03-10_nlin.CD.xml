      <title>Landscape computations for the edge of chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic sampling approach to identify stability boundaries in general dynamical systems. The global landscape of Lyapunov exponent in multi-dimensional parameter space provides transition boundaries for stable/unstable trajectories, i.e., the edge of chaos. Despite its usefulness, it is generally difficult to derive analytically. In this study, we reveal the transition boundaries by leveraging the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm coupled directly with the numerical integration of nonlinear differential/difference equation. It is demonstrated that a posteriori modeling for parameter subspace along the edge of chaos determines an inherent constrained dynamical system to flexibly activate or de-activate the chaotic tra jectories.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of Environmental Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small, forested catchments are prototypes of terrestrial ecosystems and have been studied in several disciplines of environmental sciences since several decades. Time series of water and matter fluxes and nutrient concentrations from these systems exhibit a bewildering diversity of spatio-temporal patterns, indicating the intricate nature of processes acting on a large range of time scales. Nonlinear dynamics is an obvious framework to investigate catchment time series. We analyze selected long-term data from three headwater catchments in the Bramke valley, Harz mountains, Lower Saxony in Germany at common biweekly resolution for the period 1991 to 2023. For every time series, we perform gap filling, detrending and removal of the annual cycle using Singular System Analysis (SSA), and then calculate metrics based on ordinal pattern statistics: the permutation entropy, permutation complexity and Fisher information, as well as their generalized versions (q-entropy and {\alpha}-entropy). Further, the position of each variable in Tarnopolski diagrams is displayed and compared to reference stochastic processes, like fractional Brownian motion, fractional Gaussian noise, and \b{eta} noise. Still another way of distinguishing deterministic chaos and structured noise, and quantifying the latter, is provided by the complexity from ordinal pattern positioned slopes (COPPS). We also construct Horizontal Visibility Graphs and estimate the exponent of the decay of the degree distribution. Taken together, the analyses create a characterization of the dynamics of these systems which can be scrutinized for universality, either across variables or between the three geographically very close catchments.</description>

      <title>The study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"odinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We refer to our method as cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic functions can be quantized with arbitrary precision. Crucially, our method is exact. Being free from any approximations, cascade quantization dispenses with simplifying assumptions such as the weakly-nonlinear limit, or semiclassical dynamics in the quantized system -- both of which have been critical in facilitating quantization in the literature. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over the existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Inductively coupled Josephson junctions: a platform for rich neuromorphic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are by nature neuromorphic hardware devices capable of mimicking excitability and spiking dynamics. When coupled together or combined with other superconducting elements, they can emulate additional behaviors found in biological neurons. From a technological point of view, JJ-based neuromorphic systems are particularly appealing since they present THz-speed processing and they operate with near-zero power dissipation. In this work we study a system of inductively coupled JJs and focus on the nonlinear dynamical aspects of its neurocomputational properties. In particular, we report on spiking behavior related to a saddle-node \emph{off} invariant cycle bifurcation and excitability type \RNum{2}, synchronization, first spike latency effects, and multistability. Special emphasis is placed on the bursting dynamics the system is capable of reproducing, and a new underlying mechanism is proposed beyond the approach followed in prior works.</description>
