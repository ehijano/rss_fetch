      <title>On the Edge of Safety: Charge-Charge Correlation in the Back-to-Back Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Charge-Charge Correlation (QQC) in electron-positron annihilation as a probe of charge dynamics in Quantum Chromodynamics. While generally divergent beyond leading order, we show that the QQC is infrared and collinear safe in the back-to-back limit, a property that we dub leading-power safety. This enables an analytic perturbative treatment that bypasses the reliance on non-perturbative track or fragmentation functions. Using Soft-Collinear Effective Field Theory, we derive a factorization theorem and determine its logarithmic behavior analytically up to four loops in QCD, uncovering remarkable connections with the Energy-Energy Correlation (EEC). Prior to this work, the behavior of the QQC beyond leading order was entirely unknown; we now establish its resummation to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^4$LL) accuracy, placing it among the observables with the highest perturbative precision alongside the EEC. Our results are validated through a numerical analysis using Event2, exhibiting excellent agreement with the predicted singular terms. This work establishes the QQC as a novel, calculable probe of charge dynamics and unveils a new window into the inner workings of non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>(Non-)Perturbative Dynamics of a Light QCD Axion: Dark Matter and the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considerable theoretical efforts have gone into expanding the reach of the QCD axion beyond its canonical mass--decay-constant relation. The $Z_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion model reduces the QCD axion mass naturally, by invoking a discrete $Z_\mathcal{N}$ symmetry through which the axion field is coupled to $\mathcal{N}$ copies of the Standard Model. Before the QCD phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm QCD}$, the $Z_\mathcal{N}$ potential has a minimum at misalignment angle $\theta=\pi$. At $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta =\pi$ becomes a maximum; the axion potential becomes exponentially suppressed and develops $\mathcal{N}$ minima -- only one of which actually solves the strong CP problem. Before $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta$ relaxes towards $\pi$. After $T_{\rm QCD}$, the axion field starts from around the hilltop and may have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the newly suppressed potential barriers. Such a field evolution leads to nonlinear effects via the self-interactions near the hilltop, which can cause the exponential growth of fluctuations and backreaction on the coherent motion. This behavior can influence the relic density of the field and the minimum in which it settles. We conduct the first lattice simulations of the $Z_{\mathcal{N}}$ QCD axion using ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice to accurately calculate dark matter abundances and find nonlinear dynamics reduce the abundance by up to a factor of two. We furthermore find that the probability of solving the strong CP problem tends to diverge considerably from the naive expectation of $1/\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <title>Complementary Planetary Spectroscopy Probes of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM) interactions via spectroscopic signatures of energy injection in planetary environments. We develop a general framework to account for how DM energy injection signals depend on the DM spatial distribution, planetary structure, and DM energy deposition profile. We combine UV airglow data on the Solar System's gas giants from the Voyager and New Horizons flybys, and ionospheric measurements from AMS-02 and ELFIN CubeSat on Earth, with internal heat flow data from Cassini, Voyager, and terrestrial boreholes, to constrain DM-nucleon scattering across both heavy and light mediator scenarios. We show that Earth, gas giants, and ice giants probe complementary DM masses and mediator properties, and forecast the reach of a free-floating Super-Jupiter. These results establish planetary spectroscopy as a powerful and versatile probe of the dark sector, complementary to direct detection, cosmology, and collider searches.</description>

      <title>Symbolic regression and precision LHC physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of symbolic regression to derive compact analytical expressions for angular observables relevant to electroweak boson production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Focusing on the angular coefficients that govern the decay distributions of $W$ and $Z$ bosons, we investigate whether symbolic models can well approximate these quantities, typically computed via computationally costly numerical procedures, with high fidelity and interpretability. Using the PySR package, we first validate the approach in controlled settings, namely in angular distributions in lepton-lepton collisions in QED and in leading-order Drell-Yan production at the LHC. We then apply symbolic regression to extract closed-form expressions for the angular coefficients $A_i$ as functions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and invariant mass, using next-to-leading order simulations of $pp \to \ell^+\ell^-$ events. Our results demonstrate that symbolic regression can produce accurate and generalisable expressions that match Monte Carlo predictions within uncertainties, while preserving interpretability and providing insight into the kinematic dependence of angular observables.</description>

      <title>Re-optimization of a deep neural network model for electron-carbon scattering using new experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated deep neural network model for inclusive electron-carbon scattering. Using the bootstrap model [Phys.Rev.C 110 (2024) 2, 025501] as a prior, we incorporate recent experimental data, as well as older measurements in the deep inelastic scattering region, to derive a re-optimized posterior model. We examine the impact of these new inputs on model predictions and associated uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the resulting cross-section predictions in the kinematic range relevant to the Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE experiments.</description>

      <title>Assessing the lattice QCD space diffusion coefficient and the thermalization time of charm quark by mean of D meson observables at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal in the study of heavy-flavour production is to determine the interaction strength between Heavy Quarks (HQs) and the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), quantified by the spatial diffusion coefficient $D_s(T)$. Recent lattice QCD (lQCD) results with dynamical fermions suggest a remarkably low value of $2\pi T D_s \approx 1$ at $T=T_c$ for charm quarks - significantly lower than both quenched QCD estimates and most phenomenological models - which typically yield $2\pi T D_s \approx 3.5 - 5$. This discrepancy raises the question of whether such a small $D_s(T)$, corresponding to a thermalization time $\tau_{th} \approx 1 - 1.5$ fm/c, is compatible with experimental measurements of key observables like the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, the elliptic and triangular flow coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ for D mesons. Using an event-by-event Langevin transport framework, we analyze several scenarios and highlight the pivotal role played by the momentum dependence of the drag coefficient $A(p) = \tau_{th}^{-1}(p)$. Our findings show that a small $2\pi T D_s (p\rightarrow 0)\approx 1 - 2$ values can align with experimental data \emph{only} if a significant momentum dependence in $\tau_{th}(p)=1/A(p)$ is included, as predicted by T-matrix approaches, or by the extended Quasi-Particle Model (QPMp). In contrast, assuming a momentum-independent $\tau_{th} = M_c D_s^{\text{lQCD}} / T$, it fails to reproduce the observed phenomenology. Furthermore, a short thermalization time of $\tau_{th} \approx 1.5$ fm/c implies a loss of sensitivity of the final-state observables to the initial charm-quark momentum distribution up $p_T \approx M_c$, suggesting a possible universal behavior driven by a dynamical attractor.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of two-photon interaction at high energies: accessing dilute and high parton density of the photon structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, gamma-gamma interactions in electron-positron collisions are studied across both low- and high-energy regimes. The analysis includes contributions from the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) model (via Reggeon exchange), the Quark Parton Model (via box diagrams), and the gluonic component (described using the dipole formalism), which becomes dominant at high energies. A key feature of the dipole picture is that a photon can fluctuate into a quark-antiquark (qqbar) pair, forming a color dipole. The dipole-dipole cross section is modeled using two different prescriptions. We analyze the impact of these models on several key observables: the total cross section for real photons, including heavy quark production; for virtual photons; and the photon structure function. Both prescriptions express the dipole-dipole interaction in terms of the dipole-proton scattering amplitude, used in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). This amplitude is obtained by solving the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) non-linear evolution equation, incorporating running coupling and various models that differ in their treatment of the transition between the dilute and saturation regimes. These approaches exhibit distinct behaviors in photon-photon interactions at high energies: while one prescription describes the photon as a smaller and denser system, the other treats it as a larger and more dilute configuration. Accordingly, they predict greater and lesser hadron production in the final state, respectively, at the energies of future colliders. These characteristics become more significant with increasing photon virtuality.</description>

      <title>Screening Masses for Scalar and Pseudoscalar Mesons and their Diquark Partners: Insights from the Contact Interaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate the screening masses of forty spin-zero meson and diquark states composed of light, heavy and heavy-light quarks, within a symmetry-preserving framework based on Dyson-Schwinger equations and a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction. This effective interaction reproduces hadron static properties at $T=0$ MeV that are in close agreement with experimental data and results from more sophisticated interaction kernels. Our analysis reveals that, at temperatures above the critical temperature, the dressed quark masses of the lightest mesons converge toward their respective current quark masses. Our work extends this study up to $T=500$ MeV. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the screening masses of meson parity partners become degenerate above a characteristic temperature, a phenomenon that is likewise reflected in the thermal evolution of their associated Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes (BSAs), providing robust evidence for chiral symmetry restoration. A similar trend is observed for scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks, whose screening masses also converge at high temperatures. As a consequence, these diquarks shall contribute equally to the baryon screening masses in the high-temperature regime. Wherever results from other approaches are available, we perform direct comparisons and observe consistency with our findings.</description>

      <title>Detection of Dark Matter Axions via the Quantum Hall Effect in a Resonant Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for detecting dark matter axions using a resonant cavity coupled with a quantum Hall system. When a sample exhibiting quantum Hall effect is placed inside the cavity and the cavity is tuned to resonance, two-dimensional electrons absorb the amplified radiation, leading to a rise in the sample's temperature. By monitoring this temperature increase, the mass $m_a$ of the axion can be inferred. As an example, consider a GaAs sample with small thickness $d = 0.1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ and its heat capacity $C_s$ at temperature $T = 20\,\mathrm{mK}$. According to the QCD axion model, because the energy flux of the incoming radiation is $P_{ra}\sim 10^{-18}g_{\gamma}^2\mbox{W cm}^{-2}(10^{-5}\mbox{eV}/m_a)(B/1.5\times 10^5\mbox{Gauss})^2 (\rho_d/0.3\rm GeV cm^{-3})$ at the resonance with $g_{\gamma}(\rm KSVZ)=-0.96$ and $g_{\gamma}(\rm DFSZ)=0.37$, the temperature increase $(P_{ra}/C_s)\times \tau$ is approximately $\simeq 0.25(\mbox{mK})(\tau/10\mbox{ms})\,g_{\gamma}^2\,(20\mbox{mK}/T)^3(10^{-5}\mbox{eV}/m_a)(B/1.5\times 10^5\mbox{Gauss})^2(0.1\mu \mbox{m}/d)$, where $\tau$ is the time constant associated with the heat dissipation into thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Violating Higgs Decays in a Minimal Doublet Left-Right Symmetric Model with an Inverse Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work , we study the Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV) of Higgs decays in the context of the Doublet Left-Right Symmetric model (DLRSM), based on the gauge group $SU\left(2\right)_{L}\otimes SU\left(2\right)_{R}\otimes U\left(1\right)_{B-L}$. The enlarged gauge and Higgs sectors induce new charged currents interactions. Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in two stages, with a new scale arising from the vacuum expectation value $v_{R}$ of the right-handed doublet. We consider scenarios where $v_{R}$ is above the electroweak scale. Neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism, leading to LFV through neutrino mixing. We diagonalize the full neutrino mass matrix and express the mixing in terms of physical parameters. We also explore the scalar sector to reproduce the observed Higgs mass and compute LFV Higgs decays rates as functions of the heavy neutrino scale.</description>

      <title>Implications of a dark grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that dark matter and normal matter are nontrivially unified in a grand unified theory, called dark grand unification, we derive novel residual theories at low energy explaining dark matter and neutrino mass. The first chain of which is $E_6\to SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L\otimes SU(3)_R$, which contains a matter parity by itself stabilizing a dark matter candidate and producing neutrino mass via a seesaw. The second chain is $\mathrm{Trinification}\to SU(3)_C \otimes SU(3)_L\otimes U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_N$, which results in a novel family-universal 3-3-1-1 model, opposite to the normal 3-3-1-1 (or corresponding 3-3-1) model. Surprisingly, it is a variant of both minimal 3-3-1 model and 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos since both $e_R$ and $\nu_R$ are located at the bottoms of lepton triplets. Since this universal 3-3-1-1 model is properly embedded in the trinification, the above matter parity works governing dark matter stability as well as suppressing unwanted fermion mixings. Further, neutrino masses are naturally generated by a canonical seesaw too.</description>

      <title>Boosting Sensitivity to $HH\to b\bar{b} \gamma\gamma$ with Graph Neural Networks and XGBoost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance the sensitivity of double Higgs boson searches in the \( HH \to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma \) decay channel at $\sqrt{s} = $ 13.6 TeV. Two ML models are implemented and compared: a tree-based classifier using XGBoost, and a geometrical-based graph neural network classifier (GNN). We show that the geometrical model outperform the traditional XGBoost classifier improving the expected 95\% CL upper limit on the double Higgs boson production cross-section by 28\%. Our results are compared to the latest ATLAS experiment results, showing significant improvement of both upper limit and Higgs boson self-coupling ($\kappa_{\lambda}$) constraints.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions and gravitational form factors at large momentum transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the soft collinear effective theory (SCET), we derive a factorization theorem which resums Sudakov logarithms $(\alpha_s\ln^2(-t))^n$ to all orders in the quark-in-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) at large momentum transfer $t$, and perform a consistency check to one-loop. We show that the same Sudakov factor appear in the `Feynman' contribution to the GPDs of the nucleon. Our result enables the resummation of all the large logarithms $\ln Q^2$ and $\ln^2t$ in exclusive processes with two hard scales $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^2\ll |t| \ll Q^2$. We also present a SCET power counting analysis of the Feynman contributions to the GPDs and show that the $x$-dependence of GPDs factorizes at large-$t$ with controlled corrections. This in particular implies that any ratio of GPD moments such as the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors (GFF) is perturbatively calculable in this approximation. Furthermore, we identify a novel ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ power-law $t$-dependence in the GPD and the $D$-type GFF that will dominate over the standard ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ leading twist asymptotic contribution in the phenomenologically relevant region of $t$.</description>

Abstract: The $X(3872)$ is theoretically predicted to have a spin-0 partner state denoted as $X_0$. Assuming the $X_0$ as a $D\bar{D}$ molecular bound state, we calculate the decay widths of $X_0\to VV$ and $X_0 \to PP$ ($V$ and $P$ stand for light vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively) via intermediate charmed meson loops. Three different configurations of the $X_0$, i.e., pure neutral components ($\theta = 0$), isospin singlet ($\theta = \pi/4$) and pure charged components ($\theta = \pi/2$), are investigated. Within a commonly accepted range of the model parameter $\alpha$, the predicted decay widths of $X_0 \to VV$ are on the order of a few hundred $\mathrm{keV}$, while the decay widths of $X_0 \to PP$ can reach several $\mathrm{MeV}$. The $X_0 \to \rho\rho$ and $\pi\pi$ have larger decay rates. The relative width ratios between the channels are nearly model-independent. Moreover, among those channels only with isovector or isoscalar mesons, the relevant ratios are also independent of the phase angle. The predicted ratios are helpful for searching the $X_0$ in the future experiments at BESIII and Belle II.</description>

      <title>Investigation of nonlinear dipole cross sections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear corrections to the Golec-Biernat Wusthoff (GBW) and Bartels- Golec- Kowalski (BGK) models, as discussed by Peredo-Hentschinski [M.A.Peredo and M.Hentschinski, Phys.Rev.D{109}, 014032 (2024)], are analyzed in terms of the gluon density$^{,}$s nonlinear behavior. We incorporate these nonlinear corrections into the low $x$ gluon distribution of the modified BGK model for electron-ion colliders. By verifying that these results allow for a more direct assessment of the relevance of nonlinear corrections in describing the dipole cross section of heavy nuclei, we determine the dipole cross section at a fixed $\sqrt{s}$ and $Q^2$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$ of the center-of-mass energy of electron-ion colliders. Additionally, we examine the nonlinear gluon density in the photoproduction cross sections of vector mesons $\Psi(2s)$ and $J/\Psi$ on a lead nucleus.</description>

      <title>Plasma Dynamics in Higher-Derivative Electrodynamics: A Renormalised Two-Loop Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-temperature study of Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics, following electron-proton plasmas through one- and two-loop order with dimensional regularisation and hard-thermal-loop resummation. The higher-derivative operator is found to generate no new ultraviolet divergences; all counter-terms reduce to the single photon wave-function factor of ordinary QED. The static inter-particle force acquires a double-Yukawa profile, the familiar Debye term plus an opposite-signed contribution from the heavy Podolsky pole that removes the Coulomb singularity at sub-femtometre distances, providing an intrinsic ultraviolet completion of electrostatics. Gauge symmetry drives the transverse photon self-energy to zero at vanishing momentum, so no magnetic screening mass appears at any perturbative order. In a covariantly constant background the full two-loop sunset diagram yields a single, dimension-eight operator suppressed by T^2/M^2, implying permille-level shifts in thermodynamic quantities for realistic plasmas. The exact Debye mass and a leading-log calculation show the dc electrical conductivity exceeds its QED value by less than 10^-4. Conditions for observable Podolsky plasmons and cosmological constraints are identified, supplying precise benchmarks for future strong-field, collider and lattice investigations.</description>

      <title>Polarization analysis in $e^+e^-\rightarrow J/\psi\rightarrow$ baryon-antibaryon pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive polarization analysis for the process $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow J/\psi \rightarrow$ baryon-antibaryon pairs~$B_{1}\bar{B}_{2}$. All possible helicity amplitudes for $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow J/\psi$ and $J/\psi \rightarrow B_{1} \bar{B}_{2}$ are provided, along with their transformation properties under parity and $CP$ operations. Taking full account of beam polarization, we analyze the polarization of the $J/\psi$ produced in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation and show that all eight independent polarization components can be nonzero. By introducing a polarization transfer matrix, we propose a novel method to compute the polarization transfer in the decay $J/\psi \rightarrow B_{1} \bar{B}_{2}$. Considering both hadronic and radiative baryon decay models, we derive the joint angular distribution of the final-state particles. Focusing on the process $J/\psi \rightarrow \Lambda \bar{\Sigma}^{0}$, we provide statistical sensitivity estimates for probing $CP$ violation in associated production of different baryons. This work establishes a complete framework for studying the parity and $CP$ violations present in baryon productions and decays within the helicity formalism.</description>

      <title>Diffractive electroproduction of light vector particles: leading Fock-state contribution in the presence of significant higher Fock-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exclusive diffractive production of vector mesons and photon using the color dipole model with leading Fock state light front wave functions derived from Dyson Schwinger and Bethe Salpeter equations. New results for the $\phi$ meson and real photon are presented. Without data fitting, our calculation well matches HERA data in certain kinematical domains. The key finding of this paper is that in a color dipole model study for $\rho/\gamma$ and $\phi$, where light quarks are involved, the leading $q\bar{q}$ approximation is valid only when $Q^2$ exceeds $20$ and 10 GeV$^2$ respectively, unlike $J/\psi$ which can be well described for $Q^2\approx 0$ GeV$^2$. This underscores the special role of $\phi$ electroproduction in color dipole picture: it strikes a balance between the large dipole size typical of light mesons and the smaller size associated with high $Q^2$ photons, making it potentially well suited for probing gluon saturation effects.</description>

      <title>Searches for new light particles at the Troitsk Meson Factory (TiMoFey)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The project of a new accelerator complex at the Institute for Nuclear Research of RAS in Troitsk has recently been included in the Russian National Program ``Fundamental Properties of Matter". It will sustain a proton beam with a current of 300 (100) $\mu$A and a proton kinetic energy of $T_p=423\,(1300)$ MeV at the first (second) stage of operation. The complex is multidisciplinary, and here we investigate its prospects in exploring new physics with light, feebly interacting particles. We find that TiMoFey can access new regions of parameter space of models with light axion-like particles and models with hidden photons, provided by a generic multipurpose detector installed downstream the proton beam dump. The signature to be exploited is the decay of a new particle into a pair of known particles inside the detector. Likewise, TiMoFey can probe previously unreachable ranges of parameters of models with millicharged particles obtained in measurements with detectors recognizing energy deposits associated with elastic scattering of new particles, passing through the detector volume. The latter detector may be useful for dark matter searches, as well as for studies of neutrino physics suggested at the facility in the Program framework.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Polynomial Hybrid Inflation: Planck and ACT Compatibility via Radiative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of one-loop radiative corrections in a non-supersymmetric model of hybrid inflation with a chaotic (polynomial-like) potential,$V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p$, in the light of the latest constraints from \textit{Planck} and \textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope} (ACT) observations. Here, $V_0$ denotes the energy scale of inflation, and $\lambda_p$ is a coupling associated with the polynomial term of power $p$. These corrections can naturally arise from couplings of the inflaton to other matter fields, which also facilitate the reheating process. At the tree level, the predictions of such models for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ typically lie outside the current observational bounds. However, incorporating one-loop radiative corrections modifies the potential to, \[ V(\phi) = V_0 + \lambda_p \phi^p + A \phi^4 \ln (\phi/ \mu), \] where $A$ characterizes the strength of the inflaton's coupling to other fields, and \(\mu\) is an appropriate renormalization scale. This radiatively corrected potential can reconcile the model with the combined \textit{Planck}+ACT data over a suitable range of parameter space explored in this work. In particular, radiative corrections from fermionic loops ($A &lt; 0$) suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, while simultaneously yielding a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s &lt; 1$, even for sub-Planckian field excursions. This brings the prediction in line with current observations, while still allowing for potentially detectable signatures of primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, the inflaton's couplings enable successful reheating and naturally accommodate non-thermal leptogenesis, providing a unified framework for inflation and baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Direct Evaluation of CP Phase of CKM matrix, General Perturbative Expansion and Relations with Unitarity Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, using a rephasing invariant formula $\delta = \arg [ { V_{ud} V_{us} V_{c b} V_{tb} / V_{ub} \det V_{\rm CKM} }]$, we evaluate the CP phase $\delta$ of the CKM matrix $V_{\rm CKM}$ perturbatively for small quark mixing angles $s_{ij}^{u,d}$ with associated phases $\rho_{ij}^{u,d}$.
  Consequently, we derived a relation $\delta \simeq \arg [\Delta s_{12} \Delta s_{23} / ( \Delta s_{13} - s^u_{12} e^{-i \rho^u_{12}} \Delta s_{23} )]$ with $\Delta s_{ij} \equiv s^d_{ij} e^{-i \rho^d_{ij}} - s^u_{ij} e^{-i \rho^u_{ij}}$. Such a result represents the analytic behavior of the CKM phase. The uncertainty in the relation is of order $O(\lambda^{2}) \sim 4\%$, which is comparable to the current experimental precision. Comparisons with experimental data suggest that the hypothesis of some CP phases being maximal. We also discussed relationships between the phase $\delta$ and unitarity triangles. As a result, several relations between the angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta$ are identified through other invariants $V_{il} V_{jm} V_{kn} / \det V_{\rm CKM}$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon mass in covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory at leading two-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the nucleon mass within a manifestly relativistic formulation of baryon chiral perturbation theory (BChPT), extending the framework to leading two-loop order ($\mathcal{O}(p^5)$). By employing dimensional counting analysis and rigorously verifying the extended on-mass-shell scheme at this order, we obtain a complete chiral representation of the nucleon mass that preserves analyticity, respects proper power counting, and maintains renormalization-scale independence. The resulting expression exhibits excellent convergence, with $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ contributions remaining small ($\sim 8~\rm{MeV}$). This formulation provides a robust foundation for chiral extrapolation, demonstrating remarkable agreement with lattice QCD data across a wide range of pion masses ($M_\pi \lesssim 300~\rm{MeV}$). The success of this calculation establishes two-loop relativistic BChPT as a precision tool for studying nucleon structure and related properties.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the nucleon from the chiral effective model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the confining pressure and associated global property, i.e, D-term, of the nucleon using the skyrmion approach formulated within scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory. In this framework, the nucleon is modeled as a skyrmion, and a scalar meson is introduced to incorporate the effects of the scale anomaly via low-energy theorems. The contributions from the current quark mass and gluonic dynamics to the scale anomaly are encoded through the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively. By decomposing the nucleon's energy-momentum tensor, we isolate the anomalous components and analyze their role in generating pressure. We find that the gluonic contribution to the scale anomaly plays a dominant role in producing confining pressure. In comparison with results from conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, the total pressure derived from sChPT provides improved qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results. We also evaluate the D-term and compare it with recent lattice and model-independent determinations.</description>

      <title>Columbia plot based on symmetry-improved CJT formalism in linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Columbia plot for the chiral phase transition in the framework of a three-flavor linear sigma model based on the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism. The conventional CJT approach with the Hartree truncation suffers from artificial chiral breaking, leading to the violation of the Nambu-Goldstone theorem and the (anomalous) chiral Ward-Takahashi identities. We apply the symmetry-improved CJT formalism to resolve this issue. We observe a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point in the light-quark mass regime, which is fairly insensitive to the size of the sigma meson, in contrast to the conventional CJT approach. The tricritical point, found on the $m_s$ axis, is at $m_s^{\rm tri}/m_s^{\rm phys.} = 0.175$ with $m_s^{\rm phys.}$ being the physical strange quark mass in real-life QCD. The critical pion mass in the three-flavor symmetric limit, on the second-order boundary, is measured at $m_\pi \sim 52.4$ MeV, with the critical temperature $T_c \sim 51.7$ MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the work of [1] to the case in which final-state jets, produced in association with a Higgs or vector boson, are defined using the $k_t$ algorithm. We thereby compute the full distribution of the invariant mass squared of the leading, highest-$p_t$ jet, including both clustering and non-global logarithms, up to four-loops in perturbation theory. Our results are derived within the eikonal approximation under the assumption of strong ordering in the momenta of the final-state partons, and are consequently valid up to single-logarithmic accuracy. The final semi-analytical expressions retain the complete dependence on both colour and the jet radius. The broad features of $k_t$ clustering observed in $e^+ e^-$ processes persist in hadronic collisions, together with novel characteristics that are absent in the $e^+ e^-$ environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the complete electroweak loop corrections to the process $ gg \to gH $ at the Large Hadron Collider. The electroweak corrections to the total cross section are found to be approximately $ +4\% $. At the differential level, the corrections exceed $ +4\% $ in the low Higgs transverse momentum region and fall below $ -4\% $ in the high transverse momentum region, leading to a noticeable shape distortion for this distribution. Our results represent a necessary step towards to complete next-to-leading order electroweak correction of the Higgs + jet process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large theoretical uncertainty due to the choice of the top-quark mass renormalisation scheme is present in QCD predictions for Higgs boson pair production. In these proceedings, we report on the recent progress in tackling these uncertainties for the $gg\to HH$ amplitude in the high-energy limit $s,|t|,|u| \gg m_t^2 \gg m_H^2$. Using the Method of Regions and Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, the leading power in $m_t$ behaviour of the amplitude is understood to all orders in the strong coupling expansion, and leading logarithmic resummation leads to a significant reduction in the scheme choice uncertainty in the virtual amplitude for di-Higgs production at high energies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Non-Thermal Leptogenesis from Early Matter Domination on Gravitational Wave from FOPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of non-thermal leptogenesis on the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by a strong first-order phase transition in the early Universe. We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field, $\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\phi$-dominated era and the entropy injection from the decays of $\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO. If observed, they would provide valuable insights into the thermal history and dynamics of the early Universe.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the away-side hadron-triggered modification factor $I_{AA}$ in $AA$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies for scenarios with and without quark-gluon plasma formation in $pp$ collision. We find that for both scenarios theoretical results for $I_{AA}$ agree well with the available data for 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb and 0.2 TeV Au+Au collisions. We make predictions for $I_{AA}$ in 7 TeV O+O collisions that are planned at the LHC. Our results show that measuring $I_{OO}$ in the whole centrality interval and at small centrality ($\lesssim 5$%) may give information on the presence of jet quenching in $pp$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Lepton parity dark matter and naturally unstable domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple and predictive setup that connects neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and gravitational waves. A minimal lepton parity DM scenario is considered where the residual symmetry $(-1)^L$ from the type I seesaw acts as the dark parity $D=(-1)^{L+2j}$, ensuring DM stability without imposing any new symmetry. A singlet Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity serves as the DM candidate, interacting via a real scalar $\sigma$ which is also even lepton parity. The scalar potential possesses an accidental $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, whose spontaneous breaking gives rise to unstable domain walls (DW) in the presence of explicit $\mathcal{Z}_2$ breaking terms allowed by the lepton parity. The subsequent DW annihilation generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background potentially observable at different GW experiments.</description>

Abstract: Goofy transformations of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field generally prohibit its bare mass term. This opens up an entirely new class of solutions to the electroweak (EW) hierarchy problem. We argue that these can be intrinsically linked to the flavor structure and origin of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Categorical Anomaly Matching</title>

Abstract: Matching 't Hooft anomalies is a powerful tool for constraining the low-energy dynamics of quantum systems and their allowed renormalization group (RG) flows. For non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, however, a key challenge has been the lack of a precise framework to characterize and quantify anomalies. We address this by identifying tensor functors between UV and IR symmetry categories as central to capturing these constraints. To this end, we introduce Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies) as fundamental building blocks of categorical anomalies. A given symmetry category may support multiple ASCies, each encoding distinct anomalous features. These structures naturally arise in the context of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where tensor functors correspond to RG-interfaces between UV and IR SymTFTs, and ASCies are realized as particular such interfaces satisfying simple, universal criteria. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through examples involving anomalous 0-form, higher-form, and crucially, non-invertible symmetries in various spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Criticality analysis of nuclear binding energy neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods, in particular deep learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) with many layers, have become widespread and useful tools in nuclear physics. However, these ANNs are typically treated as ``black boxes'', with their architecture (width, depth, and weight/bias initialization) and the training algorithm and parameters chosen empirically by optimizing learning based on limited exploration. We test a non-empirical approach to understanding and optimizing nuclear physics ANNs by adapting a criticality analysis based on renormalization group flows in terms of the hyperparameters for weight/bias initialization, training rates, and the ratio of depth to width. This treatment utilizes the statistical properties of neural network initialization to find a generating functional for network outputs at any layer, allowing for a path integral formulation of the ANN outputs as a Euclidean statistical field theory. We use a prototypical example to test the applicability of this approach: a simple ANN for nuclear binding energies. We find that with training using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer, the predicted criticality behavior is realized, and optimal performance is found with critical tuning. However, the use of an adaptive learning algorithm leads to somewhat superior results without concern for tuning and thus obscures the analysis. Nevertheless, the criticality analysis offers a way to look within the black box of ANNs, which is a first step towards potential improvements in network performance beyond using adaptive optimizers.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe. Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model are also resolved in our model.</description>

      <title>Clustering of Primordial Black Holes in Excursion Set Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) within the framework of Excursion Set Theory (EST). The EST formalism is extended to compute the joint probability of forming PBH pairs within a clustering distance, based on two stochastic trajectories with a shared history. Our results show that an enhanced power spectrum not only increases the formation of PBHs in specific mass ranges but also enhances their clustering probability. We find a one-to-one correspondence between the blue-tilted spectral index and the mass ranges in which PBHs form and cluster. Additionally, we demonstrate that the clustering probability decreases asymptotically with increasing clustering distance, while a higher critical density threshold (barrier) leads to a suppression of clustering abundance.</description>

      <title>Lattice Calculation of Short-Range Contributions to Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay $\pi^-\to\pi^+ ee$ at Physical Pion Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decays provide an excellent probe for determining whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions. The short-range matrix elements associated with the $\pi^- \to \pi^+ ee$ process contribute at leading order in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay channel $nn \to ppee$ through pion exchange between nucleons. However, current lattice calculations show notable discrepancies in predicting these short-range contributions. To address this issue, we perform a lattice QCD calculation of the $\pi^- \to \pi^+ ee$ matrix elements using domain wall fermion ensembles at the physical pion mass generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations. To mitigate contamination from around-the-world effects, we develop a new method to reconstruct and subtract them directly from lattice data. We then perform a nonperturbative renormalization using the RI/SMOM scheme. Compared with previous studies, this work reduces the uncertainties in the matrix elements and provides an independent cross-check that helps to reconcile the discrepancies among previous lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>$\nu p$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk I pay tribute to Toshimitsu Yamazaki who died earlier this year. Yamazaki's leading contributions to Hadronic Physics, in particular to Strangeness Nuclear Physics in Japan and elsewhere, are well known. Two of the five Recurring Themes of his research, as listed in the Japan Academy site, are highlighted here: (i) Discovery of deeply bound pionic-atom states, and (ii) Search for kaonic nuclei -- Kaonic Proton Matter (KPM). I conclude by reviewing briefly my own recent work, confirming Farrar's conjecture that a deeply bound $H$ dibaryon is not ruled out by the weak-decay observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei. However, the relatively long lifetime of such a deeply bound $H$ is much too short to qualify it for a Dark-Matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Comparing Generative Models with the New Physics Learning Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative approaches, following the framework presented in Grossi et al. (2025). We highlight the efficiency tradeoffs of the method and the computational costs that come from adopting learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the advantages of the different methods for different use cases.</description>

      <title>Energy flow and radiation efficiency in radiative GRMHD simulations of neutron star ultraluminous X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the energy flow and radiation efficiency of accreting neutron stars as potential ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We perform ten simulations {in radiative general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD)}, exploring six different magnetic dipole strengths ranging from 10 to 100 GigaGauss, along with three accretion rates, 100, 300, and 1000 Eddington luminosity units. Our results show that the energy efficiency in simulations with a strong magnetic dipole of 100 GigaGauss is approximately half that of simulations with a magnetic dipole an order of magnitude weaker. Consequently, radiation efficiency is lower in simulations with stronger magnetic dipoles. We also demonstrate that outflow power increases as the magnetic dipole weakens, resulting in stronger beaming in simulations with weaker magnetic dipoles. As a result of beaming, simulations with magnetic dipole strengths below 30 GigaGauss exhibit apparent luminosities consistent with those observed in ULXs. As for the accretion rates, we find that higher accretion rates lead to more powerful outflows, higher kinetic efficiency, and lower radiation efficiency compared to those of lower accretion rate simulations.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory of renormalization group in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density functional renormalization group (density-fRG) is proposed to investigate the density fluctuations within the functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to quantify the medium effect and study physics of high densities. This method is applied to the nucleon-meson effective field theory, also known as the Walecka model, to study the properties of nuclear matter at high baryon densities. It is found that both the attractive and repulsive nucleon meson interactions are screened by the high density medium, which results in a stiffer equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter in the regime of $\rho_0 \lesssim \rho \lesssim 2.5 \rho_0$, then a softer EoS when $\rho \gtrsim 2.5 \rho_0$. Here $\rho_0$ denotes the saturation baryon density of symmetric nuclear matter. Furthermore, a new phenomenon called the locking of Fermi surface is found. In the locking of Fermi surface the effective energy of quasi-nucleon is always close to the Fermi surface, which are both running with the renormalization group scale.</description>

      <title>PSR J0614-3329: A NICER case for Strange Quark Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of neutron star masses and radii by the NICER mission impose important constraints on the nuclear equation of state. The most recent NICER measurement of PSR J0614-3329 reported an equatorial radius of $R_{eq} = 10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}$ km for a mass of $M = 1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} M_{\odot}$. Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we demonstrate using Bayesian hypothesis ranking that strange quark stars are preferred over all the physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius. This provides a strong case for the possible existence of strange quark stars, suggesting that they should be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data. Using a wide sample of equations of state, we report the nucleonic equations of state that best fit current observations and rule out one model of strange quark matter.</description>

Abstract: We consider the effects of a local axion dark matter background on the $g-2$ of the electron. We calculate loop corrections to the photon-electron vertex and determine analytical formulas for the spin and cyclotron frequencies when the electron is in an external magnetic field. By comparing with current measurements of these observables, we are able to place the strongest constraint on the axion-elecron coupling for axion masses below $3\times10^{-18}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinophilic mediators are well-motivated messenger particles that can probe some of the least known sectors of fundamental physics involving nonstandard interactions of neutrinos with themselves and potentially with dark matter. In particular, light mediators coupling to the active neutrinos will induce new decay modes of the Standard Model mesons (e.g., $\pi^\pm, K^\pm \to \ell^\pm + \nu + \phi$), charged leptons (e.g., $\tau^\pm \to \pi^\pm + \nu + \phi$), and gauge bosons (e.g., $Z \to \nu + \bar\nu + \phi$). A common lore is that these decays suffer from infrared divergences in the limit of the vanishing mediator mass, i.e., $m_\phi \to 0$. Here, we show that including the 1-loop contributions of these mediators to the standard 2-body decays (e.g., $\pi^\pm,\,K^\pm \to \ell^\pm + \nu$, etc.), the infrared divergence from the 3-body decay cancels out exactly by virtue of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. Including these cancellation effects, we then update the existing laboratory constraints on neutrinophilic scalar mediators, thereby extending the limits far beyond the decaying parent particle mass and excluding a wider range of parameter space. These new ``physical'' limits derived here have significant implications for the future detection prospects of nonstandard neutrino (self-)interactions.</description>

      <title>Transverse Energy-Energy Correlator for Vector Boson-Tagged Hadron Production in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse energy-energy correlator (TEEC) event-shape observable for back-to-back $\gamma + h$ and $Z + h$ production in both $pp$ and $pA$ collisions. Our study incorporates nuclear modifications into the transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization framework, with resummation up to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, for TEEC as a function of the variable $\tau = \left(1 + \cos{\phi} \right)/2$, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle between the vector boson and the final hadron. We analyze the nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$ in $p\mathrm{Au}$ collisions at RHIC and $p\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that the TEEC observable is a sensitive probe for nuclear modifications in TMD physics. Specifically, the changes in the $\tau$-distribution shape provide insights into transverse momentum broadening effects in large nuclei, while measurements at different rapidities allow us to explore nuclear modifications in the collinear component of the TMD parton distribution functions in nuclei.</description>

Abstract: We compute the invariant mass of dijets produced in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation processes up to four loops in perturbation theory for both anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ jet algorithms. The calculations, performed within the eikonal approximation and employing strong-energy ordering, capture the full analytic structure of the leading Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms, including full colour and jet-radius dependence. We evaluate the significance of these logarithms and the convergence of the four loop perturbative expansion by comparing with all-orders numerical results.</description>

      <title>Composite asymmetric dark matter with a dark photon portal: Multimessenger tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) is the framework that naturally explains the coincidence of the baryon density and the dark matter density of the Universe. Through a portal interaction sharing particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the Standard Model and dark sectors, dark matter particles, which are dark-sector counterparts of baryons, can decay into antineutrinos and dark-sector counterparts of mesons (dark mesons) or dark photon. Subsequent cascade decay of the dark mesons and the dark photon can also provide electromagnetic fluxes at late times of the Universe. The cosmic-ray constraints on the decaying dark matter with the mass of $1$--$10$~GeV has not been well studied. We perform comprehensive studies on the decay of the composite ADM by combining the astrophysical constraints from $e^\pm$ and $\gamma$-ray. The constraints from cosmic-ray positron measurements by AMS-02 are the most stringent at $\gtrsim2$~GeV: a lifetime should be larger than the order of $10^{26}$~s, corresponding to the cutoff scale of the portal interaction of about $10^8 \text{--} 10^9 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. We also perform the dedicated analysis for the neutrino monoenergetic signals at Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande due to the atmospheric neutrino background in the energy range of our interest.</description>

      <title>Electroweak phase transition with the confinement scale of the strong sector or Dilaton in the minimal composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal Composite Higgs model (MCHM) provides an effective trigger for the Baryogenesis scenario through the confinement scale of the strong sector ($f$) or Dilaton ($\chi$). $f$ is a parameter with mass dimension, which stores the resonances of particles at high energies, has a suitable value of about 800 GeV. But when $300$ GeV $\le f \le 400$ GeV, the effective Higgs potential has a first order electroweak phase transition. Therefore, although $f$ cannot be a perfect trigger, it does suggest an effective approach that accommodates the resonances of particles. Thus the investigation of the electroweak phase transition according to $f$ has confirmed that the inclusion of Dilaton in the effective potential is reasonable. Accordingly, we derive a Dilaton potential with appropriate parameter domains and $f=800$ GeV, the mass of Dilaton ranges from 300 GeV to 700 GeV, which will give an electroweak phase transition strength greater than 1 and less than 3, enough for a first order phase transition. This is a direct and clear prove of the triggers for the first order EWPT in MCHM.</description>

      <title>Can one-loop corrections to the one-gluon exchange potential adequately describe the charmed meson spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the charmed meson spectrum using a constituent quark model (CQM) with one-loop corrections applied to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) potential. The study aims to understand if the modified version of our CQM sufficiently account for the charmed meson spectrum observed experimentally, without invoking exotic quark and gluon configurations such as hybrid mesons or tetraquarks. Within this model, charmed mesons' masses are computed, comparing theoretical predictions to experimental data. The results, within uncertainties, suggest that our theoretical framework generally reproduces mass splittings and level ordering observed for charmed mesons. Particularly, large discrepancies between theory and experiment found in $P$-wave states are, at least, significantly ameliorated by incorporating higher-order interaction terms. Therefore, the findings emphasize that while the traditional quark model is limited in fully describing charmed mesons, enhanced potential terms may bridge the gap with experimental observations. The study contributes a framework for predicting excited charmed meson states for future experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Impact of momentum-dependent drag coefficient on energy loss of charm and bottom quarks in QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the momentum of heavy particles affects their interaction rate, and consequently their energy loss, in a quark-gluon plasma. To account for this momentum dependence, the drag coefficient is derived by expressing the energy loss coefficients as polynomial expansions of momentum ($p$). This approach allows for a more precise investigation of momentum dependence of drag coefficient by incorporating the linear terms of these expansions. Additionally, the influence of particle's momentum on radiative and collisional energy loss is more clearly determined. The study focuses on calculation of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of charm and bottom quarks in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}} = 5.02 \: TeV$. The initial distribution functions have been evolved numerically based on the Fokker-Planck equation. The results are compared with the latest data from ALICE and ATLAS experiments, conducted in 2021 and 2022.</description>

      <title>Hunting for heavy $Z^\prime$ with IceCube neutrinos and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the minimal gauged B-L extension of the Standard Model, we demonstrate that PeV-scale dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) can be simultaneously explained through the three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) present in the theory. The DM candidate undergoes decay into light neutrinos, providing an explanation for the observed IceCube events, while the other two RHNs generate the BAU via leptogenesis. The breaking of gauge symmetry gives rise to detectable gravitational waves (GWs) from decaying cosmic strings (CS), making this framework testable at several future GW detectors-despite being beyond the reach of conventional collider experiments due to the extremely weak coupling. The symmetry-breaking scale establishes a connection between particle masses, couplings, and the GW spectrum, offering a unified and predictive scenario.</description>

      <title>Nonholomorphic $A_4$ modular invariance for fermion masses and mixing in SU(5) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing the fermion flavor structures using modular invariance is a challenging task in the framework of quark-lepton unification. Building on recent applications of modular symmetry in non-supersymmetric models, we propose the first renormalizable $SU(5)$ grand unified theory incorporating level 3 nonholomorphic modular symmetry, $\Gamma_3 \simeq A_4$. This framework constrains Yukawa couplings to polyharmonic Maa{\ss} forms, significantly reducing the number of free parameters while enhancing the predictive power of the models. We present a comprehensive analysis of fermion masses and mixing while tackling key GUT queries such as gauge coupling unification and proton decay. Beyond the minimal $SU(5)$ framework, the Higgs sector incorporates the $45_H$ dimensional Higgs field crucial in differentiating the masses of down quarks and charged leptons, and the fermion sector is extended with three right-handed neutrinos enabling neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw mechanism. We analyze two benchmark models with distinct modular weight and $A_4$ charge assignments. The predicted effective Majorana mass $m_{\beta \beta}$ values align with current neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments, and the effective neutrino mass $m_\beta$ is within the reach of future beta decay searches. The predicted sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_i$, satisfies the upper bound set by recent cosmological observations. The gauge coupling unification is achieved through a light scalar triplet $\phi_3 \sim (3,3,-1/3)$ and a scalar octet $\phi_5 \sim (8,2,1/2)$ belonging to the $45_H$ Higgs, while proton decay constraints require a highly suppressed Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <title>Open Heavy flavor mesons in hot asymmetric strange hadronic matter -- A QCD sum rule approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The in-medium masses of the pseudoscalar open charm ($D$, $\bar D$, $D_s$ and $\bar {D_s}$) and open bottom ($B$, $\bar B$, $B_s$ and $\bar {B_s}$) mesons in hot asymmetric strange hadronic matter are studied within a QCD sum rule approach. These are computed using the medium modifications of the light quark condensates ($\langle{\bar{q_i}}{q_i}\rangle$, with $(q_i,i=1,2,3)\equiv(u,d,s)$), the gluon condensates and other operators in the operator product expansion upto mass dimension 5. Within a chiral SU(3) model, the quark condensates are obtained from the medium modifications of the non-strange and strange scalar-isoscalar fields ($\sigma$ and $\zeta$), and the scalar-isovector field, $\delta$, whereas, the gluon (scalar and twist-2) condensates are computed from the in-medium value of the dilaton field, $\chi$, which is incorporated within the chiral model to mimic the broken scale invariance of QCD. The splittings of the masses of the $D-\bar D$ ($B-\bar B)$, as well as $D_s-\bar {D_s} (B_s-\bar {B_s})$ in the hadronic medium are due to the odd part of the spectral function. For the strange-charm (strange-bottom) mesons ($(q_i,i=3)\equiv s$), the value of $\langle {q_i}^\dagger {q_i} \rangle$ dominates over the contributions from the other operators of the odd part of the spectral function. This is observed as opposite behaviour of the particle-antiparticle mass splittings with the mass of the particle to be larger (smaller) than the antiparticle mass in nuclear (hyperonic) matter. The density and isospin asymmetry effects are observed to be the dominant medium effects which might have observable consequences on the production of charmonia and open charm mesons, and, on the production ratios, $D^+/D^-$ and $D^0/\bar {D^0}$, in asymmetric heavy ion collisions in the CBM experiment at FAIR at the future facility at GSI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on a novel baryon-number ($\mathcal{B}$) violating process within neutron stars, where two neutrons convert into two dark photons ($nn \rightarrow VV$) via new Higgs-like scalar bosons. This process is believed to be greatly suppressed at low energies but could be highly amplified in a dense neutron environment like neutron stars. The $nn \rightarrow VV$ process could give rise to non-trivial effects that are distinct from similar processes in previous studies and could alter the properties of neutron stars, such as orbital periods, collapse thresholds, stability conditions, cooling rates, gravitational wave emissions, etc. The emitted dark photons may serve as dark-matter candidates and exhibit special red-shifted energy spectra mainly linked to the compactness of the neutron star. We point out that the dark photons emitted from neutron stars may yield detectable signals in future experiments. We also show that the precision pulsar-timing data provides a powerful tool to constrain the parameter space of new-physics models. The study of the $nn \rightarrow VV$ process, which combines astronomical observations and particle physics models together, may open new windows into the detection of the $\mathcal{B}$-violating effects and may also provide new insights on the study of the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Identifying triple-strangeness $\Omega$ hyperons in light of recent experimental results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically calculate the mass spectra and decay widths of $\Omega$ baryons with $N\leq3$, where $N=2n_\rho+2n_\lambda+l_\rho+l_\lambda$ is the shell of the three-body harmonic oscillator. In our scheme, the newly observed $\Omega(2109)$ is identified as a $N=2$ candidate, with its quantum numbers tentatively assigned as $\Omega(2S,3/2^+)$. However, the experimentally measured mass exhibits a deviation of approximately 50 MeV below the theoretical predictions. The possible reason for this deviation, along with the suggestion for experiments, are discussed in this paper. Additionally, we give possible assignments of $\Omega(2012)^-$, $\Omega(2250)^-$, $\Omega(2380)^-$, and $\Omega(2470)^-$. Furthermore, we calculate the masses and widths of other missing $\Omega$ states, which could provide valuable clues for experimental searches aimed at discovering these states.</description>

      <title>Rephasing invariants of CP violation for heavy and light Majorana neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the canonical seesaw mechanism, the strengths of charged-current interactions for light and heavy Majorana neutrinos are described respectively by the $3\times 3$ matrices $U$ and $R$ that are correlated with each other via the exact seesaw relation and the unitarity condition. We write out the Majorana-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$, which are insensitive to redefining the phases of three charged-lepton fields; and the Dirac-type invariants of CP violation of $R$ and $U$ that are insensitive to the rephasing of both the charged-lepton fields and the neutrino fields. Such invariants are explicitly calculated with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the seesaw flavor structure containing nine active-sterile flavor mixing angles and six independent CP-violating phases, and their corresponding roles in the CP-violating asymmetries of three heavy Majorana neutrino decays and in the flavor oscillations of three light Majorana neutrinos are briefly discussed. We point out that similar rephasing invariants arising from the interplay between $R$ and $U$ may also manifest themselves in a variety of lepton-flavor-violating and lepton-number-violating processes.</description>

Abstract: The charm quark density-density correlation is calculated for $1S$ and $1P$ conventional charmonia and $J^{PC}=1^{-+},0^{+-}$ charmoniumlike states from lattice QCD and are interpreted as spatial wave functions of these states with some approximations. The angular distributions of $c\bar{c}$ in conventional charmonia are found to be in accordance with the expectation of two-body systems, while that of the $1^{-+}$ state exhibits an $S$-wave feature. However, the $c\bar{c}$ radial distributions turn out to be strikingly different from the non-relativistic quark model and can be understood by the Dirac theory of two-body bound states. These results provide the first gauge invariant and model-independent three-dimensional portraits of charmonium(like) states.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Gravitational Waves on BREAD</title>

Abstract: The use of light axion dark matter experiments as high-frequency gravitational wave (HFGW) detectors has garnered increasing attention in recent years. We explore the capabilities of the Broadband Reflector Experiment for Axion Detection (BREAD) in probing the GW parameter space and study the directional dependence of its coverage. This detector can investigate frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 200 THz. We find that employing single photon detectors BREAD is sensitive to GWs with characteristic strains as low as $10^{-21}$ at 0.1 THz and $10^{-25}$ at 200 THz with a year exposure time, making it competitive with other proposals operating at similar frequencies.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing resonant Higgs pair production at the LHC: effects of coloured and neutral scalars in the NMSSM test case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study resonant production of pairs of Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs bosons, in the presence of new neutral Higgs states together with new coloured scalars (stops or sbottoms) in loops within the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric SM (NMSSM). This is used as a test case to prove that the Large Hadron Collider has sensitivity to a variety of effects stemming from interferences between resonant (heavy) Higgs diagrams and/or among these and non-resonant topologies involving loops of both tops and stops. These effects can alter significantly the naive description of individual $s$-channel Breit-Wigner resonances, leading to distortions of the latter which, on the one hand, may mask their presence but, on the other hand, could enable one to extract features of the underlying new physics scenario. This last aspect is made possible through a decomposition of the $gg\to hh$ signal process into all its amplitude components, each of which has a well-defined coupling structure. Ultimately, such effects can be traced back to the relevant Feynman diagrams and can enable a detailed interpretation of this process. To illustrate this, we introduce various Benchmark Points that exhibit potentially observable features during the current and/or upcoming runs of the LHC in one or more of the three customary di-Higgs decay channels: $b\bar bb\bar b$, $b\bar b \tau^+\tau^-$ and $b\bar b\gamma\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes and $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) give an access to timelike gravitational form factors (GFFs) which are complementary to the spacelike ones which can be deduced from the hadronic generalized parton distributions (GPDs) measured in deep exclusive electroproduction processes. They allow to probe the GFFs of unstable baryons in the baryon octet, since the second moments of hadronic generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) lead to the timelike GFFs. These GDAs can be measured in the process $e^+ e^- \to B \bar{B} \gamma$, in the generalized Bjorken regime where the invariant mass of the $B \bar{B}$ pair is near threshold at high energy facilities, such as BESIII, Belle II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility. In this work, we investigate this process using the QCD collinear factorization framework, where the scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of the baryon timelike electromagnetic (EM) FFs and Compton FFs. We also provide a numerical estimate of the cross sections with a model for baryon-antibaryon GDAs. Our work provides us a possibility to extract the timelike baryon GFFs from near future experimental measurements, and these GFFs may be further used to study longstanding questions in hadronic physics such as the baryon spin decomposition and D-term.</description>

      <title>evortran: a modern Fortran package for genetic algorithms with applications from LHC data fitting to LISA signal reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: evortran is a modern Fortran library designed for high-performance genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimization. evortran can be used to tackle a wide range of problems in high-energy physics and beyond, such as derivative-free parameter optimization, complex search taks, parameter scans and fitting experimental data under the presence of instrumental noise. The library is built as an fpm package with flexibility and efficiency in mind, while also offering a simple installation process, user interface and integration into existing Fortran (or Python) programs. evortran offers a variety of selection, crossover, mutation and elitism strategies, with which users can tailor an evolutionary algorithm to their specific needs. evortran supports different abstraction levels: from operating directly on individuals and populations, to running full evolutionary cycles, and even enabling migration between independently evolving populations to enhance convergence and maintain diversity. In this paper, we present the functionality of the evortran library, demonstrate its capabilities with example benchmark applications, and compare its performance with existing genetic algorithm frameworks. As physics-motivated applications, we use evortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct gravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA mock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generation of Axions and Axion-Like Particles through Mass Parametric Resonance induced by Scalar Perturbations in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be generated in the early Universe through mechanisms such as misalignment production, thermal processes, and the decay of topological defects. In this paper, we show that scalar perturbations in the early universe could produce a significant amount of these particles primarily through mass parametric resonance effects. Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g. during the QCD phase transition. These temperature fluctuations modulate the particle mass, transferring energy into the field through parametric mass resonance, a nonlinear process. This mechanism exhibits substantially unstable regions that could lead to explosive particle productions. Notably, it does not generate additional isocurvature perturbations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first review the theoretical and experimental studies of the process $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+ \eta \Lambda$. Motivated by the recent BESIII and Belle measurements, we have conducted a theoretical study of the process $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+ \eta \Lambda$, where the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ resonances are dynamically generated from the $S$-wave meson meson and meson baryon interaction, respectively. Our results give a reasonable description of the invariant mass distributions, which implies that the spin flip contribution in the $\Sigma(1385)$ excitation plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Renormalon effect of quasi-PDF in gradient flow formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of renormalon ambiguities in the context of quasi-parton distribution functions (quasi-PDFs) defined using gradient-flowed fields. We examine how this impacts the UV and IR renomalons. Using the large $\beta_0$ approximation, we find that UV renormalons for zero external momentum quasi-PDF are eliminated by the flow, while IR renormalons persist but are modified at finite flow time. Moreover, we observe that large numerical coefficients associated with flowed operators can enhance power-suppressed contributions, making higher-dimensional operators non-negligible even at small flow times.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.A comparison with previous data driven ($e^+e^-$ and $\tau$-decays) estimates is done.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (81\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref.[1], after adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions, and can be compared with the one from the most precise Lattice result $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM} = (87\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by revising our predictions on the LO HVP contributions in adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions to the ones in Ref.[1]. Then, we obtain: $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3516\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $ and $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2770.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours.</description>

      <title>Resonant enhancement of axion dark matter decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion is particularly well motivated candidate for the dark matter comprising most of the mass of our visible Universe, leading to worldwide experimental and observational efforts towards its discovery. As is well known, resonant cavities are a primary tool in this search, where they are used to enhance the conversion rate of axions into photons in a background electromagnetic field. What is perhaps less well appreciated is that resonant cavities can also enhance the rate at which axions decay to two photons, a manifestation of the Purcell effect. We explore this possibility and show that it offers a novel method to search the axion parameter space in a way that is competitive and complimentary to other approaches, with the capability to probe the most-favoured region for QCD axion dark matter. Furthermore, we establish that this method can be implemented via pre-existing axion heterodyne detection schemes, enabling such experiments to perform these searches with minimal modification.</description>

Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the confining pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Affine and Rational Quadratic Spline Coupling and Autoregressive Flows through Robust Statistical Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normalizing flows have emerged as a powerful brand of generative models, as they not only allow for efficient sampling of complicated target distributions but also deliver density estimation by construction. We propose here an in-depth comparison of coupling and autoregressive flows, both based on symmetric (affine) and non-symmetric (rational quadratic spline) bijectors, considering four different architectures: real-valued non-Volume preserving (RealNVP), masked autoregressive flow (MAF), coupling rational quadratic spline (C-RQS), and autoregressive rational quadratic spline (A-RQS). We focus on a set of multimodal target distributions of increasing dimensionality ranging from 4 to 400. The performances were compared by means of different test statistics for two-sample tests, built from known distance measures: the sliced Wasserstein distance, the dimension-averaged one-dimensional Kolmogorov--Smirnov test, and the Frobenius norm of the difference between correlation matrices. Furthermore, we included estimations of the variance of both the metrics and the trained models. Our results indicate that the A-RQS algorithm stands out both in terms of accuracy and training speed. Nonetheless, all the algorithms are generally able, without too much fine-tuning, to learn complicated distributions with limited training data and in a reasonable time of the order of hours on a Tesla A40 GPU. The only exception is the C-RQS, which takes significantly longer to train, does not always provide good accuracy, and becomes unstable for large dimensionalities. All algorithms were implemented using \textsc{TensorFlow2} and \textsc{TensorFlow Probability} and have been made available on \href{https://github.com/NF4HEP/NormalizingFlowsHD}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Holographic spectroscopy of fermion with instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we investigate the fermionic spectroscopy in the D(-1)-D3 brane system. The background geometry of this system described by IIB supergravity includes a black (deconfined) and bubble (confined) D3-brane which corresponds respectively to a deconfined and a confined gauge theory in holography. The charge of the D(-1) brane as the D-instanton gives the gluon condensate in this model. To simplify the holographic setup, we first reduce briefly the ten-dimensional supergravity background produced by D(-1)-D3-branes to an equivalently five-dimensional background. Then the fermionic spectrum in the confined case is obtained by decomposing the fermion with dimensional reduction. In addition, by using the standard method for computing the Green function in the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive the equations for the fermionic correlation functions and solve them numerically with the infalling boundary condition. Our numerical results in the deconfined case illustrate that the fermionic correlation function as spectral function includes two branches of the dispersion curves whose behavior is very close to the results obtained from the method of hard thermal loop. And the effective mass generated by the medium effect of fermion splits into two values due to the spin-dependent interactions induced by instantons. In the confined case, the holographic correlation function indicates several separated dispersion curves which illustrates consistently the onset mass in the fermionic spectrum we obtained. Therefore, this work in holography demonstrates the instantonic configuration is very influential to the fermion in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general $U(1)$-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of effective field theory for dissipative fluids in flat Minkowski spacetime. We derive the most general quadratic action for hydrodynamic modes, including stochastic noise, and analyze the corresponding dispersion relations in a consistent gradient expansion. We argue that spontaneous breaking of spacetime symmetry arises in the presence of a local thermal state specified by a local timelike four-vector. We demonstrate that hydrodynamical perturbations can be identified as Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, analogous to their embedding in global $U(1)$-invariant theories. We find that frame-invariant combinations of hydrodynamic transport coefficients determine the first-order dispersion relations in the low-energy limit, making the mode analysis manifestly independent of the choice of hydrodynamic frame. Assuming local Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry and unitarity of the underlying UV theory, we show that first-order hydrodynamics is stable if the enthalpy density is positive.</description>

Abstract: We present a procedure for handling asymmetric errors. Many results in particle physics are presented as values with different positive and negative errors, and there is no consistent procedure for handling them. We consider the difference between errors quoted using pdfs and using likelihoods, and the difference between the rms spread of a measurement and the 68\% central confidence region. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the possibilities, and software tools to enable their use.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping leading hadronic muon anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We bootstrap the leading order hadronic contribution to $a_\mu$ using unitarity, analytic properties, crossing symmetry and finite energy sum rules (FESR) from quantum chromodynamics (QCD), establishing a lower bound. Combining this lower bound with the remaining precisely calculated contributions from quantum electrodynamics and electroweak interactions, we achieve a lower bound on muon anomaly $a_\mu$. Since the FESRs have uncertainties, our bound depends on the choices of FESRs within these uncertainties. A conservative choice of the FESR gives a conservative lower bound, consistent with Standard Model (SM) data-driven prediction. We show that there are other valid choices of FESRs within the uncertainties that lead to lower bounds, which are inconsistent with SM data-driven prediction but consistent with the measured values of the muon anomaly. The bootstrapped spectral density shows a $\rho$-resonance peak similar to experimental hadronic cross-ratio data, providing a bootstrap prediction for $\rho$-meson mass.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-$\Delta$ elastic cross section in isospin-asymmetric nuclear medium with inclusion of scalar-isovector $\delta$ meson field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production, dynamic evolution, and decay of $\Delta$ particles play a crucial role in understanding the properties of high baryon density nuclear matter in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent nucleon-$\Delta$ elastic cross section ($\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$) is studied within the relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck framework, in which the $\delta$ meson field is further considered. The results show that the $\delta$ and $\rho$ meson related exchange terms have a nonnegligible contribution to the $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ compared to only considering the $\rho$ meson exchange terms, although there is a significant cancellation on the cross section among these meson exchange terms. In addition, due to the different effects of the medium correction on the effective mass of neutrons, protons, and differently charged $\Delta$s, the individual $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ exhibits an ordered isospin-asymmetry ($\alpha$) dependence, and $\sigma^{*}_{n\Delta}$ and $\sigma^{*}_{p\Delta}$ have opposite $\alpha$ dependencies. And the $\alpha$ dependence of the ratio $R(\alpha)=\sigma^{*}(\alpha)/\sigma^{*}(\alpha=0)$ for $n\Delta$ reaction channels follow $n\Delta^{++}&gt;n\Delta^{+}&gt;n\Delta^{0}&gt;n\Delta^{-}$, while for $p\Delta$ it is $p\Delta^{-}&gt;p\Delta^{0}&gt;p\Delta^{+}&gt;p\Delta^{++}$. Moreover, the results also indicate that the isospin effect on the $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$, which is dominantly caused by the isovector $\rho$ and $\delta$ meson fields, is still pronounced at densities up to 3 times normal nuclear density. Finally, a parametrization of the energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent $N\Delta$ elastic cross section is proposed based on the microscopic calculated results, and the in-medium $\sigma^{*}_{N \Delta}$ in the energy range of $\sqrt{s}$=2.3$\sim$3.0 GeV can be well described.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Implies a Coupled Dark Sector: Insights from DESI DR2 via a Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) have revealed compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy, challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we adopt a data-driven, model-independent approach to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and its potential interaction with dark matter using combined background cosmological datasets, including DESI DR2, cosmic chronometers, observational Hubble data, and Type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Process regression and a non-parametric formalism, we first confirm a $\sim 2\sigma$ indication of dynamical dark energy, featuring a phantom crossing around redshift $z \sim 0.4$, consistent with DESI results. We then explore the implications of dynamical EoS from DESI DR2 for dark sector coupling. Incorporating priors on the EoS from DESI DR2, we find a $\sim 2\sigma$ signal for non-zero interactions between dark energy and dark matter at low redshift. Our results suggest that if DESI's evidence for time-varying dark energy is confirmed, a coupled dark sector may be a necessary extension beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Greedy Emulators for Nuclear Two-Body Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of reduced basis method emulators are increasing in low-energy nuclear physics because they enable fast and accurate sampling of high-fidelity calculations, enabling robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for solving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples ("snapshots") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the groundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.</description>

      <title>A Model of Realistic Flavor Symmetry: Origin of Fermion Mass, Flavor Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I proposed a unified model of particle physic and cosmology in \cite {1}, which can simultaneously account for these phenomena of the inflation, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino mass and baryogenesis. I here focus on the fermion flavor issues in the model, which were not addressed previously. I introduce a realistic flavor symmetry to generate the fermion mass and mixing, from which the relationship between the quark mixing and the lepton mixing is derived, and the source of the difference between them is revealed. In particular, I derive a neutrino mass matrix which has a special structure form and contains five parameters, but its numerical solutions are precisely fitting to all the measured data of the neutrino mass spectrum, quark mixing and lepton mixing, and finely predict $m_{\nu_{2}}=0.01288$ eV. In addition, I discuss a new scenario of the leptogenesis in the model, which arises from two CP-asymmetric decays of a super-heavy neutral Dirac fermion, this scenario is closely related to the neutrino mass and mixing, so the baryon asymmetry is determined by the neutrino flavor parameters. Lastly, I suggest several approaches to test the model. In short, the model can simply and elegantly account for the fermion flavor issues and the baryon asymmetry, it has realistic and measurable significance, therefore we expect the ongoing and future experiments to test the model.</description>

      <title>Static horizons in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although previous results have ruled out the possibility of a static horizon in cosmology, we present black hole and white hole metrics that retain static horizons while reproducing cosmological behavior at large distances. Using an appropriate coordinate choice, we demonstrate that a static horizon can exist in a cosmological setting without introducing curvature invariant singularities at the horizon. The resulting metric reduces to the Schwarzschild de Sitter solution when the Hubble parameter is constant. We find that white hole metrics in an expanding universe (or black holes in a contracting universe) are significantly easier to construct, as a black hole in an expanding cosmology requires the velocity function to change sign. Consequently, this work primarily examines white holes in expanding cosmologies as a foundation for subsequent analysis of black holes in expanding universes. In later sections, we investigate scenarios involving a white hole coupled with cosmological matter, as well as a white hole with both matter and a cosmological constant. Assuming the pressure component takes its cosmological value, we show that the physical radius of the apparent horizon can asymptotically approach a constant value at late times. This metric avoids pathologies such as a singular horizon in the limit of a vanishing Hubble parameter. Finally, we analyze the realistic case of a black hole embedded in pressureless cosmological matter with and without a cosmological constant and explore its properties.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of the photoproduction of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ mesons in peripheral $PbPb$ collisions at the center - of - mass energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is performed, considering distinct assumptions for the modeling of the nuclear photon flux, photon - nucleus cross - section, overlap function and dipole - proton scattering amplitude. The comparison of these predictions with the ALICE data is also performed. Our results indicate that a detailed analysis of the production of both mesons will be very useful to improve the description of photon - induced processes in peripheral collisions.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclear Matter To Dense Compact-Star Matter</title>

Abstract: An argument is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be understood in terms of the mechanism referred to as ``pseudo-conformal sound speed" in dense compact-star matter, $v_{\rm pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$. Both pros and cons are presented using an effective field theory anchored on renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's highly successful EFT $\chi$EFT$_\pi$ with the pion field only (in nuclear medium) by implementing heavy-meson degrees of freedom. Both hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter involving the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ ($f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity" is brought in via the topological structure of the nucleon, i.e., skyrmion considered to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The new inputs for the argumentation are the large N limit of the Grassmanian model for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry.</description>

Abstract: The experimentally observed temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), along with its apparent violation of the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound $\eta/s=1/(4\pi)$, necessitate a holographic description that incorporates higher-derivative corrections. We propose a five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet model in which a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $H(\phi)$ encodes leading curvature corrections. Although no closed-form black hole solution is available, we employ an entropy-production analysis at the event horizon to derive exact analytic formulas for the shear viscosity $\eta$ and bulk viscosity $\zeta$. These expressions exhibit apparent deviation from the KSS bound and nontrivial temperature dependence. We then perform an independent computation via the retarded Green function (Kubo) method, finding perfect agreement for $\eta$ and isolating a single constant in $\zeta$ that requires numerical determination. Our dual derivation underscores the pivotal role of higher-derivative terms in realistic QGP modeling and demonstrates the efficacy of nonanalytic holographic backgrounds in capturing the dynamics of strongly coupled fluids.</description>

      <title>Spectral BBGKY: a scalable scheme for nonlinear Boltzmann and correlation kinetics</title>

Abstract: The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy provides a time-reversal-symmetric framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution of many-body systems. Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical approaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the full nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the Boltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still presents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY hierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation of the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the original 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral coefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an analytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high accuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic evolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full eight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a three-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY hierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an analytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient leakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost comparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order truncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for studying multiparticle correlations. This framework advances our ability to investigate the early thermalization puzzle in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and to elucidate the applicability of hydrodynamics at remarkably early stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>
