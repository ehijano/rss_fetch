      <title>Open6G OTIC: A Blueprint for Programmable O-RAN and 3GPP Testing Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Softwarized and programmable Radio Access Networks (RANs) come with virtualized and disaggregated components, increasing the supply chain robustness and the flexibility and dynamism of the network deployments. This is a key tenet of Open RAN, with open interfaces across disaggregated components specified by the O-RAN ALLIANCE. It is mandatory, however, to validate that all components are compliant with the specifications and can successfully interoperate, without performance gaps with traditional, monolithic appliances. Open Testing &amp; Integration Centers (OTICs) are entities that can verify such interoperability and adherence to the standard through rigorous testing. However, how to design, instrument, and deploy an OTIC which can offer testing for multiple tenants, heterogeneous devices, and is ready to support automated testing is still an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce a blueprint for a programmable OTIC testing infrastructure, based on the design and deployment of the Open6G OTIC at Northeastern University, Boston, and provide insights on technical challenges and solutions for O-RAN testing at scale.</description>

      <title>FlexBSO: Flexible Block Storage Offload for Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient virtualization of CPU and memory is standardized and mature. Capabilities such as Intel VT-x [3] have been added by manufacturers for efficient hypervisor support. In contrast, virtualization of a block device and its presentation to the virtual machines on the host can be done in multiple ways. Indeed, hyperscalers develop in-house solutions to improve performance and cost-efficiency of their storage solutions for datacenters. Unfortunately, these storage solutions are based on specialized hardware and software which are not publicly available. The traditional solution is to expose virtual block device to the VM through a paravirtualized driver like virtio [2]. virtio provides significantly better performance than real block device driver emulation because of host OS and guest OS cooperation. The IO requests are then fulfilled by the host OS either with a local block device such as an SSD drive or with some form of disaggregated storage over the network like NVMe-oF or iSCSI. There are three main problems to the traditional solution. 1) Cost. IO operations consume host CPU cycles due to host OS involvement. These CPU cycles are doing useless work from the application point of view. 2) Inflexibility. Any change of the virtualized storage stack requires host OS and/or guest OS cooperation and cannot be done silently in production. 3) Performance. IO operations are causing recurring VM EXITs to do the transition from non-root mode to root mode on the host CPU. This results into excessive IO performance impact. We propose FlexBSO, a hardware-assisted solution, which solves all the mentioned issues. Our prototype is based on the publicly available Bluefield-2 SmartNIC with NVIDIA SNAP support, hence can be deployed without any obstacles.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Resource Scheduling Algorithm Based on Traffic Prediction for Coexistence of eMBB and Random Arrival URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a joint design for the coexistence of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and random low-latency communication (URLLC) with different transmission time intervals (TTI): an eMBB scheduler operating at the beginning of each eMBB TTI to decide the coding redundancy of eMBB code blocks, and a URLLC scheduler at the beginning of each mini-slot to perform immediate preemption to ensure that the randomly arriving URLLC traffic is allocated with enough radio resource and the eMBB traffic keeps acceptable one-shot transmission successful probability and throughput. The framework for schedulers under hybrid-TTI is developed and a method to configure eMBB code block based on URLLC traffic arrival prediction is implemented. Simulations show that our work improves the throughput of eMBB traffic without sacrificing the reliablity while supporting randomly arriving URLLC traffic.</description>

      <title>AirFogSim: A Light-Weight and Modular Simulator for UAV-Integrated Vehicular Fog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) is significantly enhancing the efficiency, safety, and computational capabilities of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) further elevates these advantages by incorporating flexible and auxiliary services. This evolving UAV-integrated VFC paradigm opens new doors while presenting unique complexities within the cooperative computation framework. Foremost among the challenges, modeling the intricate dynamics of aerial-ground interactive computing networks is a significant endeavor, and the absence of a comprehensive and flexible simulation platform may impede the exploration of this field. Inspired by the pressing need for a versatile tool, this paper provides a lightweight and modular aerial-ground collaborative simulation platform, termed AirFogSim. We present the design and implementation of AirFogSim, and demonstrate its versatility with five key missions in the domain of UAV-integrated VFC. A multifaceted use case is carried out to validate AirFogSim's effectiveness, encompassing several integral aspects of the proposed AirFogSim, including UAV trajectory, task offloading, resource allocation, and blockchain. In general, AirFogSim is envisioned to set a new precedent in the UAV-integrated VFC simulation, bridge the gap between theoretical design and practical validation, and pave the way for future intelligent transportation domains. Our code will be available at https://github.com/ZhiweiWei-NAMI/AirFogSim.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 5G Performance: Reducing Service Time and Research Directions for 6G Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents several methods for minimizing packet service time in networks using 5G and beyond. We propose leveraging network coding alongside Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) to reduce service time as well as optimizing Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selection based on the service time. Our network coding approach includes a method to increase the number of packets in flight, adhering to the current standard of the 16 HARQ process limit, demonstrating that these strategies can enhance throughput and reduce latency. Experimental results show that network coding reduces service times by up to 7% in low SNR regimes, with greater reduction across all SNR as the number of packets in flight increases, suggesting that future 6G standards should consider increasing the number of HARQ processes for better performance.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Transfer for Collaborative Misbehavior Detection in Untrusted Vehicular Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular mobility underscores the need for collaborative misbehavior detection at the vehicular edge. However, locally trained misbehavior detection models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that aim to deliberately influence learning outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based approach that employs transfer learning for collaborative misbehavior detection among roadside units (RSUs). In the presence of label-flipping and policy induction attacks, we perform selective knowledge transfer from trustworthy source RSUs to foster relevant expertise in misbehavior detection and avoid negative knowledge sharing from adversary-influenced RSUs. The performance of our proposed scheme is demonstrated with evaluations over a diverse set of misbehavior detection scenarios using an open-source dataset. Experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces the training time at the target RSU and achieves superior detection performance compared to the baseline scheme with tabula rasa learning. Enhanced robustness and generalizability can also be attained, by effectively detecting previously unseen and partially observable misbehavior attacks.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Offshore Open Radio Access Network Using Long Short-Term Memory Models on a Novel Artificial Intelligence-Driven Cloud-Native Data Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio access network (RAN) is a critical component of modern telecom infrastructure, currently undergoing significant transformation towards disaggregated and open architectures. These advancements are pivotal for integrating intelligent, data-driven applications aimed at enhancing network reliability and operational autonomy through the introduction of cognition capabilities, exemplified by the set of enhancements proposed by the emerging Open radio access network (O-RAN) standards. Despite its potential, the nascent nature of O-RAN technology presents challenges, primarily due to the absence of mature operational standards. This complicates the management of data and applications, particularly in integrating with traditional network management and operational support systems. Divergent vendor-specific design approaches further hinder migration and limit solution reusability. Addressing the skills gap in telecom business-oriented engineering is crucial for the effective deployment of O-RAN and the development of robust data-driven applications. To address these challenges, Boldyn Networks, a global Neutral Host provider, has implemented a novel cloud-native data analytics platform. This platform underwent rigorous testing in real-world scenarios of using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, significantly improving operational efficiency, and enhancing customer experience. Implementation involved adopting development operations (DevOps) practices, leveraging data lakehouse architectures tailored for AI applications, and employing sophisticated data engineering strategies. The platform successfully addresses connectivity challenges inherent in offshore windfarm deployments using long short-term memory (LSTM) Models for anomaly detection of the connectivity, providing detailed insights into its specialized architecture developed for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Towards Edge-Based Data Lake Architecture for Intelligent Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid urbanization growth has underscored the need for innovative solutions to enhance transportation efficiency and safety. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have emerged as a promising solution in this context. However, analyzing and processing the massive and intricate data generated by ITS presents significant challenges for traditional data processing systems. This work proposes an Edge-based Data Lake Architecture to integrate and analyze the complex data from ITS efficiently. The architecture offers scalability, fault tolerance, and performance, improving decision-making and enhancing innovative services for a more intelligent transportation ecosystem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the architecture through an analysis of three different use cases: (i) Vehicular Sensor Network, (ii) Mobile Network, and (iii) Driver Identification applications.</description>

      <title>J\"ager: Automated Telephone Call Traceback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi Optimization with Deep Diffusion Deterministic Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs), have made significant strides in modeling complex data distributions across diverse domains. Meanwhile, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated substantial improvements in optimizing Wi-Fi network performance. Wi-Fi optimization problems are highly challenging to model mathematically, and DRL methods can bypass complex mathematical modeling, while GDMs excel in handling complex data modeling. Therefore, combining DRL with GDMs can mutually enhance their capabilities. The current MAC layer access mechanism in Wi-Fi networks is the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which dramatically declines in performance with a high number of terminals. In this paper, we apply diffusion models to deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), namely the Deep Diffusion Deterministic Policy (D3PG) algorithm to optimize the Wi-Fi performance. Although similar integrations of reinforcement learning with generative diffusion models have been explored previously, we are the first to apply this approach to Wi-Fi network performance optimization. We propose an access mechanism that jointly adjusts the contention window and aggregation frame length based on the D3PG algorithm. Through simulations, we have demonstrated that this mechanism significantly outperforms existing Wi-Fi standards in dense Wi-Fi scenarios, maintaining performance even as the number of users sharply increases.</description>

      <title>DarkDNS: Revisiting the Value of Rapid Zone Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malicious actors exploit the DNS namespace to launch spam campaigns, phishing attacks, malware, and other harmful activities. Combating these threats requires visibility into domain existence, ownership and nameservice activity that the DNS protocol does not itself provide. To facilitate visibility and security-related study of the expanding gTLD namespace, ICANN introduced the Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS) that shares daily zone file snapshots of new gTLD zones. However, a remarkably high concentration of malicious activity is associated with domains that do not live long enough make it into these daily snapshots. Using public and private sources of newly observed domains, we discover that even with the best available data there is a considerable visibility gap in detecting short-lived domains. We find that the daily snapshots miss at least 1% of newly registered and short-lived domains, which are frequently registered with likely malicious intent. In reducing this critical visibility gap using public sources of data, we demonstrate how more timely access to TLD zone changes can provide valuable data to better prevent abuse. We hope that this work sparks a discussion in the community on how to effectively and safely revive the concept of sharing Rapid Zone Updates for security research. Finally, as a contribution of this work, we are releasing a public live feed of newly registered domains, with the aim of enabling further research in early abuse identification.</description>

      <title>NetMamba: Efficient Network Traffic Classification via Pre-training Unidirectional Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network traffic classification is a crucial research area aiming to enhance service quality, streamline network management, and bolster cybersecurity. To address the growing complexity of transmission encryption techniques, various machine learning and deep learning methods have been proposed. However, existing approaches face two main challenges. Firstly, they struggle with model inefficiency due to the quadratic complexity of the widely used Transformer architecture. Secondly, they suffer from inadequate traffic representation because of discarding important byte information while retaining unwanted biases. To address these challenges, we propose NetMamba, an efficient linear-time state space model equipped with a comprehensive traffic representation scheme. We adopt a specially selected and improved unidirectional Mamba architecture for the networking field, instead of the Transformer, to address efficiency issues. In addition, we design a traffic representation scheme to extract valid information from massive traffic data while removing biased information. Evaluation experiments on six public datasets encompassing three main classification tasks showcase NetMamba's superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves an accuracy rate of nearly 99% (some over 99%) in all tasks. Additionally, NetMamba demonstrates excellent efficiency, improving inference speed by up to 60 times while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. To the best of our knowledge, NetMamba is the first model to tailor the Mamba architecture for networking.</description>
