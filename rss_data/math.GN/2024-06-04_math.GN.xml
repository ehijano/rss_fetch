      <title>Graphs and Their Vietoris-Rips Complexes Have the Same Pseudotopological Weak Homotopy Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this document, we propose a bridge between the graphs and the geometric realizations of their Vietoris Rips complexes, i.e. Graphs, with their canonical \v{C}ech closure structure, have the same homotopy type that the realization of their Vietoris Rips complex.</description>

      <title>Definable convolution and idempotent Keisler measures III. Generic stability, generic transitivity, and revised Newelski's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study idempotent measures and the structure of the convolution semigroups of measures over definable groups. We isolate the property of generic transitivity and demonstrate that it is sufficient (and necessary) to develop stable group theory localizing on a generically stable type, including invariant stratified ranks and connected components. We establish generic transitivity of generically stable idempotent types in important new cases, including abelian groups in arbitrary theories and arbitrary groups in rosy theories, and characterize them as generics of connected type-definable subgroups. Using tools from Keisler's randomization theory, we generalize some of these results from types to generically stable Keisler measures, and classify idempotent generically stable measures in abelian groups as (unique) translation-invariant measures on type-definable fsg subgroups. This provides a partial definable counterpart to the classical work of Rudin, Cohen and Pym for locally compact topological groups. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a minimal left ideal in the convolution semigroup of measures for an arbitrary countable NIP group, from a minimal left ideal in the corresponding semigroup on types and a canonical measure constructed on its ideal subgroup. In order to achieve it, we in particular prove the revised Ellis group conjecture of Newelski for countable NIP groups.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>

      <title>Small Banach bundles and modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize those (continuously-normed) Banach bundles $\mathcal{E}\to X$ with compact Hausdorff base whose spaces $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ of global continuous sections are topologically finitely-generated over the function algebra $C(X)$, answering a question of I. Gogi\'c's and extending analogous work for metrizable $X$. Conditions equivalent to topological finite generation include: (a) the requirement that $\mathcal{E}$ be locally trivial and of finite type along locally closed and relatively $F_{\sigma}$ strata in a finite stratification of $X$; (b) the decomposability of arbitrary elements in $\ell^p(\Gamma(\mathcal{E}))$, $1\le p&lt;\infty$ as sums of $\le N$ products in $\ell^p(C(X))\cdot \Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ for some fixed $N$; (c) the analogous decomposability requirement for maximal Banach-module tensor products $F\widehat{\otimes}_{C(X)}\Gamma(\mathcal{E})$ or (d) equivalently, only for $F=\ell^1(C(X))$.</description>
