      <title>Parametric model reduction of mean-field and stochastic systems via higher-order action matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to learn models of population dynamics of physical systems that feature stochastic and mean-field effects and that depend on physics parameters. The learned models can act as surrogates of classical numerical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over the physics parameters. Building on the Benamou-Brenier formula from optimal transport and action matching, we use a variational problem to infer parameter- and time-dependent gradient fields that represent approximations of the population dynamics. The inferred gradient fields can then be used to rapidly generate sample trajectories that mimic the dynamics of the physical system on a population level over varying physics parameters. We show that combining Monte Carlo sampling with higher-order quadrature rules is critical for accurately estimating the training objective from sample data and for stabilizing the training process. We demonstrate on Vlasov-Poisson instabilities as well as on high-dimensional particle and chaotic systems that our approach accurately predicts population dynamics over a wide range of parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based modeling that simply condition on time and physics parameters.</description>

      <title>Learning with Importance Weighted Variational Inference: Asymptotics for Gradient Estimators of the VR-IWAE Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several popular variational bounds involving importance weighting ideas have been proposed to generalize and improve on the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) in the context of maximum likelihood optimization, such as the Importance Weighted Auto-Encoder (IWAE) and the Variational R\'enyi (VR) bounds. The methodology to learn the parameters of interest using these bounds typically amounts to running gradient-based variational inference algorithms that incorporate the reparameterization trick. However, the way the choice of the variational bound impacts the outcome of variational inference algorithms can be unclear. Recently, the VR-IWAE bound was introduced as a variational bound that unifies the ELBO, IWAE and VR bounds methodologies. In this paper, we provide two analyses for the reparameterized and doubly-reparameterized gradient estimators of the VR-IWAE bound, which reveal the advantages and limitations of these gradient estimators while enabling us to compare of the ELBO, IWAE and VR bounds methodologies. Our work advances the understanding of importance weighted variational inference methods and we illustrate our theoretical findings empirically.</description>

      <title>Deep Optimal Sensor Placement for Black Box Stochastic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting cost-effective optimal sensor configurations for subsequent inference of parameters in black-box stochastic systems faces significant computational barriers. We propose a novel and robust approach, modelling the joint distribution over input parameters and solution with a joint energy-based model, trained on simulation data. Unlike existing simulation-based inference approaches, which must be tied to a specific set of point evaluations, we learn a functional representation of parameters and solution. This is used as a resolution-independent plug-and-play surrogate for the joint distribution, which can be conditioned over any set of points, permitting an efficient approach to sensor placement. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on a variety of stochastic problems, showing that our method provides highly informative sensor locations at a lower computational cost compared to conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Global Censored Quantile Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, censored quantile regression has enjoyed an increasing popularity for survival analysis while many existing works rely on linearity assumptions. In this work, we propose a Global Censored Quantile Random Forest (GCQRF) for predicting a conditional quantile process on data subject to right censoring, a forest-based flexible, competitive method able to capture complex nonlinear relationships. Taking into account the randomness in trees and connecting the proposed method to a randomized incomplete infinite degree U-process (IDUP), we quantify the prediction process' variation without assuming an infinite forest and establish its weak convergence. Moreover, feature importance ranking measures based on out-of-sample predictive accuracy are proposed. We demonstrate the superior predictive accuracy of the proposed method over a number of existing alternatives and illustrate the use of the proposed importance ranking measures on both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization Algorithms for Linear Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training can be used to learn models that are robust against perturbations. For linear models, it can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. Compared to methods proposed in the context of deep learning, leveraging the optimization structure allows significantly faster convergence rates. Still, the use of generic convex solvers can be inefficient for large-scale problems. Here, we propose tailored optimization algorithms for the adversarial training of linear models, which render large-scale regression and classification problems more tractable. For regression problems, we propose a family of solvers based on iterative ridge regression and, for classification, a family of solvers based on projected gradient descent. The methods are based on extended variable reformulations of the original problem. We illustrate their efficiency in numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Local transfer learning Gaussian process modeling, with applications to surrogate modeling of expensive computer simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical bottleneck for scientific progress is the costly nature of computer simulations for complex systems. Surrogate models provide an appealing solution: such models are trained on simulator evaluations, then used to emulate and quantify uncertainty on the expensive simulator at unexplored inputs. In many applications, one often has available data on related systems. For example, in designing a new jet turbine, there may be existing studies on turbines with similar configurations. A key question is how information from such "source" systems can be transferred for effective surrogate training on the "target" system of interest. We thus propose a new LOcal transfer Learning Gaussian Process (LOL-GP) model, which leverages a carefully-designed Gaussian process to transfer such information for surrogate modeling. The key novelty of the LOL-GP is a latent regularization model, which identifies regions where transfer should be performed and regions where it should be avoided. This "local transfer" property is desirable in scientific systems: at certain parameters, such systems may behave similarly and thus transfer is beneficial; at other parameters, they may behave differently and thus transfer is detrimental. By accounting for local transfer, the LOL-GP can rectify a critical limitation of "negative transfer" in existing transfer learning models, where the transfer of information worsens predictive performance. We derive a Gibbs sampling algorithm for efficient posterior predictive sampling on the LOL-GP, for both the multi-source and multi-fidelity transfer settings. We then show, via a suite of numerical experiments and an application for jet turbine design, the improved surrogate performance of the LOL-GP over existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Robust Multisource Remote Sensing Image Matching Method Utilizing Attention and Feature Enhancement Against Noise Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image matching is a fundamental and critical task of multisource remote sensing image applications. However, remote sensing images are susceptible to various noises. Accordingly, how to effectively achieve accurate matching in noise images is a challenging problem. To solve this issue, we propose a robust multisource remote sensing image matching method utilizing attention and feature enhancement against noise interference. In the first stage, we combine deep convolution with the attention mechanism of transformer to perform dense feature extraction, constructing feature descriptors with higher discriminability and robustness. Subsequently, we employ a coarse-to-fine matching strategy to achieve dense matches. In the second stage, we introduce an outlier removal network based on a binary classification mechanism, which can establish effective and geometrically consistent correspondences between images; through weighting for each correspondence, inliers vs. outliers classification are performed, as well as removing outliers from dense matches. Ultimately, we can accomplish more efficient and accurate matches. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct experiments using multisource remote sensing image datasets for comparison with other state-of-the-art methods under different scenarios, including noise-free, additive random noise, and periodic stripe noise. Comparative results indicate that the proposed method has a more well-balanced performance and robustness. The proposed method contributes a valuable reference for solving the difficult problem of noise image matching.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>

      <title>A Complete Decomposition of KL Error using Refined Information and Mode Interaction Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The log-linear model has received a significant amount of theoretical attention in previous decades and remains the fundamental tool used for learning probability distributions over discrete variables. Despite its large popularity in statistical mechanics and high-dimensional statistics, the vast majority of such energy-based modeling approaches only focus on the two-variable relationships, such as Boltzmann machines and Markov graphical models. Although these approaches have easier-to-solve structure learning problems and easier-to-optimize parametric distributions, they often ignore the rich structure which exists in the higher-order interactions between different variables. Using more recent tools from the field of information geometry, we revisit the classical formulation of the log-linear model with a focus on higher-order mode interactions, going beyond the 1-body modes of independent distributions and the 2-body modes of Boltzmann distributions. This perspective allows us to define a complete decomposition of the KL error. This then motivates the formulation of a sparse selection problem over the set of possible mode interactions. In the same way as sparse graph selection allows for better generalization, we find that our learned distributions are able to more efficiently use the finite amount of data which is available in practice. On both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in maximizing the log-likelihood for the generative task and also the ease of adaptability to the discriminative task of classification.</description>

      <title>Model Balancing Helps Low-data Training and Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have emphasized the need to align pre-trained models with specialized domains using small, curated datasets. Studies on these foundation models underscore the importance of low-data training and fine-tuning. This topic, well-known in natural language processing (NLP), has also gained increasing attention in the emerging field of scientific machine learning (SciML). To address the limitations of low-data training and fine-tuning, we draw inspiration from Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, analyzing the shape of empirical spectral densities (ESDs) and revealing an imbalance in training quality across different model layers. To mitigate this issue, we adapt a recently proposed layer-wise learning rate scheduler, TempBalance, which effectively balances training quality across layers and enhances low-data training and fine-tuning for both NLP and SciML tasks. Notably, TempBalance demonstrates increasing performance gains as the amount of available tuning data decreases. Comparative analyses further highlight the effectiveness of TempBalance and its adaptability as an "add-on" method for improving model performance.</description>

      <title>Understanding Expert Structures on Minimax Parameter Estimation in Contaminated Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct the convergence analysis of parameter estimation in the contaminated mixture of experts. This model is motivated from the prompt learning problem where ones utilize prompts, which can be formulated as experts, to fine-tune a large-scaled pre-trained model for learning downstream tasks. There are two fundamental challenges emerging from the analysis: (i) the proportion in the mixture of the pre-trained model and the prompt may converge to zero where the prompt vanishes during the training; (ii) the algebraic interaction among parameters of the pre-trained model and the prompt can occur via some partial differential equation and decelerate the prompt learning. In response, we introduce a distinguishability condition to control the previous parameter interaction. Additionally, we also consider various types of expert structures to understand their effects on the parameter estimation. In each scenario, we provide comprehensive convergence rates of parameter estimation along with the corresponding minimax lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Conditional Outcome Equivalence: A Quantile Alternative to CATE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) can provide insight into the effect of a treatment beyond the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). This ability to provide information over multiple quantiles of the response makes CQTE especially valuable in cases where the effect of a treatment is not well-modelled by a location shift, even conditionally on the covariates. Nevertheless, the estimation of CQTE is challenging and often depends upon the smoothness of the individual quantiles as a function of the covariates rather than smoothness of the CQTE itself. This is in stark contrast to CATE where it is possible to obtain high-quality estimates which have less dependency upon the smoothness of the nuisance parameters when the CATE itself is smooth. Moreover, relative smoothness of the CQTE lacks the interpretability of smoothness of the CATE making it less clear whether it is a reasonable assumption to make. We combine the desirable properties of CATE and CQTE by considering a new estimand, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC). The CQC not only retains information about the whole treatment distribution, similar to CQTE, but also having more natural examples of smoothness and is able to leverage simplicity in an auxiliary estimand. We provide finite sample bounds on the error of our estimator, demonstrating its ability to exploit simplicity. We validate our theory in numerical simulations which show that our method produces more accurate estimates than baselines. Finally, we apply our methodology to a study on the effect of employment incentives on earnings across different age groups. We see that our method is able to reveal heterogeneity of the effect across different quantiles.</description>

      <title>Loss Landscape Characterization of Neural Networks without Over-Parametrziation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization methods play a crucial role in modern machine learning, powering the remarkable empirical achievements of deep learning models. These successes are even more remarkable given the complex non-convex nature of the loss landscape of these models. Yet, ensuring the convergence of optimization methods requires specific structural conditions on the objective function that are rarely satisfied in practice. One prominent example is the widely recognized Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality, which has gained considerable attention in recent years. However, validating such assumptions for deep neural networks entails substantial and often impractical levels of over-parametrization. In order to address this limitation, we propose a novel class of functions that can characterize the loss landscape of modern deep models without requiring extensive over-parametrization and can also include saddle points. Crucially, we prove that gradient-based optimizers possess theoretical guarantees of convergence under this assumption. Finally, we validate the soundness of our new function class through both theoretical analysis and empirical experimentation across a diverse range of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Training Neural Samplers with Reverse Diffusive KL Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training generative models to sample from unnormalized density functions is an important and challenging task in machine learning. Traditional training methods often rely on the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence due to its tractability. However, the mode-seeking behavior of reverse KL hinders effective approximation of multi-modal target distributions. To address this, we propose to minimize the reverse KL along diffusion trajectories of both model and target densities. We refer to this objective as the reverse diffusive KL divergence, which allows the model to capture multiple modes. Leveraging this objective, we train neural samplers that can efficiently generate samples from the target distribution in one step. We demonstrate that our method enhances sampling performance across various Boltzmann distributions, including both synthetic multi-modal densities and n-body particle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on deep neural network models have seen rapid development and are extensively used to study the stability of these networks. Among various adversarial strategies, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a widely adopted method in computer vision due to its effectiveness and quick implementation, making it suitable for adversarial training. In this work, we observe that in many cases, the perturbations computed using PGD predominantly affect only a portion of the singular value spectrum of the original image, suggesting that these perturbations are approximately low-rank. Motivated by this observation, we propose a variation of PGD that efficiently computes a low-rank attack. We extensively validate our method on a range of standard models as well as robust models that have undergone adversarial training. Our analysis indicates that the proposed low-rank PGD can be effectively used in adversarial training due to its straightforward and fast implementation coupled with competitive performance. Notably, we find that low-rank PGD often performs comparably to, and sometimes even outperforms, the traditional full-rank PGD attack, while using significantly less memory.</description>

      <title>How Does Variance Shape the Regret in Contextual Bandits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider realizable contextual bandits with general function approximation, investigating how small reward variance can lead to better-than-minimax regret bounds. Unlike in minimax bounds, we show that the eluder dimension $d_\text{elu}$$-$a complexity measure of the function class$-$plays a crucial role in variance-dependent bounds. We consider two types of adversary:
  (1) Weak adversary: The adversary sets the reward variance before observing the learner's action. In this setting, we prove that a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{A,d_\text{elu}\}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ is unavoidable when $d_{\text{elu}}\leq\sqrt{AT}$, where $A$ is the number of actions, $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $\Lambda$ is the total variance over $T$ rounds. For the $A\leq d_\text{elu}$ regime, we derive a nearly matching upper bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{A\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ for the special case where the variance is revealed at the beginning of each round.
  (2) Strong adversary: The adversary sets the reward variance after observing the learner's action. We show that a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ is unavoidable when $\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu}\leq\sqrt{AT}$. In this setting, we provide an upper bound of order $\tilde{O}(d_\text{elu}\sqrt{\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$.
  Furthermore, we examine the setting where the function class additionally provides distributional information of the reward, as studied by Wang et al. (2024). We demonstrate that the regret bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_\text{elu}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$ established in their work is unimprovable when $\sqrt{d_{\text{elu}}\Lambda}+d_\text{elu}\leq\sqrt{AT}$. However, with a slightly different definition of the total variance and with the assumption that the reward follows a Gaussian distribution, one can achieve a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{A\Lambda}+d_\text{elu})$.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Generative Modeling with Variational Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its high-dimensional observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage latent disentanglement that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoders for Warped Riemannian Metric Learning and Generative Modeling on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges. Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths. To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real world datasets, including a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell population-level trajectory inference.</description>

      <title>Context-Scaling versus Task-Scaling in In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where these models solve new tasks by using examples in the prompt without additional training. In our work, we identify and analyze two key components of ICL: (1) context-scaling, where model performance improves as the number of in-context examples increases and (2) task-scaling, where model performance improves as the number of pre-training tasks increases. While transformers are capable of both context-scaling and task-scaling, we empirically show that standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with vectorized input are only capable of task-scaling. To understand how transformers are capable of context-scaling, we first propose a significantly simplified transformer architecture without key, query, value weights. We show that it performs ICL comparably to the original GPT-2 model in various statistical learning tasks including linear regression, teacher-student settings. Furthermore, a single block of our simplified transformer can be viewed as data dependent feature map followed by an MLP. This feature map on its own is a powerful predictor that is capable of context-scaling but is not capable of task-scaling. We show empirically that concatenating the output of this feature map with vectorized data as an input to MLPs enables both context-scaling and task-scaling. This finding provides a simple setting to study context and task-scaling for ICL.</description>

      <title>Scalable Structure Learning for Sparse Context-Specific Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several approaches to graphically representing context-specific relations among jointly distributed categorical variables have been proposed, along with structure learning algorithms. While existing optimization-based methods have limited scalability due to the large number of context-specific models, the constraint-based methods are more prone to error than even constraint-based directed acyclic graph learning algorithms since more relations must be tested. We present an algorithm for learning context-specific models that scales to hundreds of variables. Scalable learning is achieved through a combination of an order-based Markov chain Monte-Carlo search and a novel, context-specific sparsity assumption that is analogous to those typically invoked for directed acyclic graphical models. Unlike previous Markov chain Monte-Carlo search methods, our Markov chain is guaranteed to have the true posterior of the variable orderings as the stationary distribution. To implement the method, we solve a first case of an open problem recently posed by Alon and Balogh. Future work solving increasingly general instances of this problem would allow our methods to learn increasingly dense models. The method is shown to perform well on synthetic data and real world examples, in terms of both accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <title>Gradient Guidance for Diffusion Models: An Optimization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated empirical successes in various applications and can be adapted to task-specific needs via guidance. This paper studies a form of gradient guidance for adapting a pre-trained diffusion model towards optimizing user-specified objectives. We establish a mathematical framework for guided diffusion to systematically study its optimization theory and algorithmic design. Our theoretical analysis spots a strong link between guided diffusion models and optimization: gradient-guided diffusion models are essentially sampling solutions to a regularized optimization problem, where the regularization is imposed by the pre-training data. As for guidance design, directly bringing in the gradient of an external objective function as guidance would jeopardize the structure in generated samples. We investigate a modified form of gradient guidance based on a forward prediction loss, which leverages the information in pre-trained score functions and provably preserves the latent structure. We further consider an iteratively fine-tuned version of gradient-guided diffusion where guidance and score network are both updated with newly generated samples. This process mimics a first-order optimization iteration in expectation, for which we proved O(1/K) convergence rate to the global optimum when the objective function is concave. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yukang123/GGDMOptim.git.</description>

      <title>Deep Optimal Experimental Design for Parameter Estimation Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal experimental design is a well studied field in applied science and engineering. Techniques for estimating such a design are commonly used within the framework of parameter estimation. Nonetheless, in recent years parameter estimation techniques are changing rapidly with the introduction of deep learning techniques to replace traditional estimation methods. This in turn requires the adaptation of optimal experimental design that is associated with these new techniques. In this paper we investigate a new experimental design methodology that uses deep learning. We show that the training of a network as a Likelihood Free Estimator can be used to significantly simplify the design process and circumvent the need for the computationally expensive bi-level optimization problem that is inherent in optimal experimental design for non-linear systems. Furthermore, deep design improves the quality of the recovery process for parameter estimation problems. As proof of concept we apply our methodology to two different systems of Ordinary Differential Equations.</description>

      <title>FredNormer: Frequency Domain Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01860v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent normalization-based methods have shown great success in tackling the distribution shift issue, facilitating non-stationary time series forecasting. Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</description>

      <title>Manifolds, Random Matrices and Spectral Gaps: The geometric phases of generative diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. To this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation on why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers, thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are highly effective in scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency, with the gating network, or router, playing a central role by directing inputs to the appropriate experts. In this paper, we establish a novel connection between MoE frameworks and attention mechanisms, demonstrating how quadratic gating can serve as a more expressive and efficient alternative. Motivated by this insight, we explore the implementation of quadratic gating within MoE models, identifying a connection between the self-attention mechanism and the quadratic gating. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the quadratic softmax gating MoE framework, showing improved sample efficiency in expert and parameter estimation. Our analysis provides key insights into optimal designs for quadratic gating and expert functions, further elucidating the principles behind widely used attention mechanisms. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the quadratic gating MoE outperforms the traditional linear gating MoE. Moreover, our theoretical insights have guided the development of a novel attention mechanism, which we validated through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate its favorable performance over conventional models across various tasks.</description>

      <title>TaCo: Targeted Concept Erasure Prevents Non-Linear Classifiers From Detecting Protected Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06499v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in NLP models is crucial, as they often encode sensitive attributes like gender and ethnicity, leading to biased outcomes. Current concept erasure methods attempt to mitigate this by modifying final latent representations to remove sensitive information without retraining the entire model. However, these methods typically rely on linear classifiers, which leave models vulnerable to non-linear adversaries capable of recovering sensitive information.
  We introduce Targeted Concept Erasure (TaCo), a novel approach that removes sensitive information from final latent representations, ensuring fairness even against non-linear classifiers. Our experiments show that TaCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving greater reductions in the prediction accuracy of sensitive attributes by non-linear classifier while preserving overall task performance.

      <title>Semidefinite Relaxations of the Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is an extension of the optimal transport problem that allows one to match objects between incomparable spaces. At its core, the GW distance is specified as the solution of a non-convex quadratic program and is not known to be tractable to solve. In particular, existing solvers for the GW distance are only able to find locally optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation of the GW distance. The relaxation can be viewed as the Lagrangian dual of the GW distance augmented with constraints that relate to the linear and quadratic terms of transportation plans. In particular, our relaxation provides a tractable (polynomial-time) algorithm to compute globally optimal transportation plans (in some instances) together with an accompanying proof of global optimality. Our numerical experiments suggest that the proposed relaxation is strong in that it frequently computes the globally optimal solution. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/tbng/gwsdp.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Gaussian Process Bandits with Unknown Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation requires fitting a Gaussian process model, which in turn requires specifying prior on the unknown black-box function -- most of the theoretical literature assumes this prior is known. However, it is common to have more than one possible prior for a given black-box function, for example suggested by domain experts with differing opinions. In some cases, the type-II maximum likelihood estimator for selecting prior enjoys the consistency guarantee, but it does not universally apply to all types of priors. If the problem is stationary, one could rely on the Regret Balancing scheme to conduct the optimisation, but in the case of time-varying problems, such a scheme cannot be used. To address this gap in existing research, we propose a novel algorithm, PE-GP-UCB, which is capable of solving time-varying Bayesian optimisation problems even without the exact knowledge of the function's prior. The algorithm relies on the fact that either the observed function values are consistent with some of the priors, in which case it is easy to reject the wrong priors, or the observations are consistent with all candidate priors, in which case it does not matter which prior our model relies on. We provide a regret bound on the proposed algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm on toy and real-world time-varying problems and show that it outperforms the maximum likelihood estimator, fully Bayesian treatment of unknown prior and Regret Balancing.</description>

      <title>Understanding What Affects the Generalization Gap in Visual Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Empirical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there are many efforts attempting to learn useful policies for continuous control in visual reinforcement learning (RL). In this scenario, it is important to learn a generalizable policy, as the testing environment may differ from the training environment, e.g., there exist distractors during deployment. Many practical algorithms are proposed to handle this problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide a theoretical understanding of what affects the generalization gap and why their proposed methods work. In this paper, we bridge this issue by theoretically answering the key factors that contribute to the generalization gap when the testing environment has distractors. Our theories indicate that minimizing the representation distance between training and testing environments, which aligns with human intuition, is the most critical for the benefit of reducing the generalization gap. Our theoretical results are supported by the empirical evidence in the DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB).</description>

      <title>Fourier Circuits in Neural Networks and Transformers: A Case Study of Modular Arithmetic with Multiple Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of machine learning, a pivotal challenge lies in deciphering the internal representations harnessed by neural networks and Transformers. Building on recent progress toward comprehending how networks execute distinct target functions, our study embarks on an exploration of the underlying reasons behind networks adopting specific computational strategies. We direct our focus to the complex algebraic learning task of modular addition involving $k$ inputs. Our research presents a thorough analytical characterization of the features learned by stylized one-hidden layer neural networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task. A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the principle of margin maximization shapes the features adopted by one-hidden layer neural networks. Let $p$ denote the modulus, $D_p$ denote the dataset of modular arithmetic with $k$ inputs and $m$ denote the network width. We demonstrate that a neuron count of $ m \geq 2^{2k-2} \cdot (p-1) $, these networks attain a maximum $ L_{2,k+1} $-margin on the dataset $ D_p $. Furthermore, we establish that each hidden-layer neuron aligns with a specific Fourier spectrum, integral to solving modular addition problems. By correlating our findings with the empirical observations of similar studies, we contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intrinsic computational mechanisms of neural networks. Furthermore, we observe similar computational mechanisms in attention matrices of one-layer Transformers. Our work stands as a significant stride in unraveling their operation complexities, particularly in the realm of complex algebraic tasks.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable model for emergence and scaling laws in the multitask sparse parity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models can exhibit what appears to be a sudden ability to solve a new problem as training time, training data, or model size increases, a phenomenon known as emergence. In this paper, we present a framework where each new ability (a skill) is represented as a basis function. We solve a simple multi-linear model in this skill-basis, finding analytic expressions for the emergence of new skills, as well as for scaling laws of the loss with training time, data size, model size, and optimal compute. We compare our detailed calculations to direct simulations of a two-layer neural network trained on multitask sparse parity, where the tasks in the dataset are distributed according to a power-law. Our simple model captures, using a single fit parameter, the sigmoidal emergence of multiple new skills as training time, data size or model size increases in the neural network.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and genetic algorithms for cosmological Bayesian inference speed-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to accelerate the Bayesian inference process, focusing specifically on the nested sampling algorithms. Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in cosmological parameter estimation, providing a robust framework for extracting theoretical insights from observational data. However, its computational demands can be substantial, primarily due to the need for numerous likelihood function evaluations. Our proposed method utilizes the power of deep learning, employing feedforward neural networks to approximate the likelihood function dynamically during the Bayesian inference process. Unlike traditional approaches, our method trains neural networks on-the-fly using the current set of live points as training data, without the need for pre-training. This flexibility enables adaptation to various theoretical models and datasets. We perform simple hyperparameter optimization using genetic algorithms to suggest initial neural network architectures for learning each likelihood function. Once sufficient accuracy is achieved, the neural network replaces the original likelihood function. The implementation integrates with nested sampling algorithms and has been thoroughly evaluated using both simple cosmological dark energy models and diverse observational datasets. Additionally, we explore the potential of genetic algorithms for generating initial live points within nested sampling inference, opening up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods.</description>

      <title>Tree-based variational inference for Poisson log-normal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When studying ecosystems, hierarchical trees are often used to organize entities based on proximity criteria, such as the taxonomy in microbiology, social classes in geography, or product types in retail businesses, offering valuable insights into entity relationships. Despite their significance, current count-data models do not leverage this structured information. In particular, the widely used Poisson log-normal (PLN) model, known for its ability to model interactions between entities from count data, lacks the possibility to incorporate such hierarchical tree structures, limiting its applicability in domains characterized by such complexities. To address this matter, we introduce the PLN-Tree model as an extension of the PLN model, specifically designed for modeling hierarchical count data. By integrating structured variational inference techniques, we propose an adapted training procedure and establish identifiability results, enhancing both theoretical foundations and practical interpretability. Additionally, we extend our framework to classification tasks as a preprocessing pipeline for compositional data, showcasing its versatility. Experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as real-world microbiome data demonstrate the superior performance of the PLN-Tree model in capturing hierarchical dependencies and providing valuable insights into complex data structures, showing the practical interest of knowledge graphs like the taxonomy in ecosystems modeling.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting under Learning Rate Conditions for $\alpha$ Sub-exponential Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the phenomenon of benign overfitting in binary classification problems with heavy-tailed input distributions, extending the analysis of maximum margin classifiers to $\alpha$ sub-exponential distributions ($\alpha \in (0, 2]$). This generalizes previous work focused on sub-gaussian inputs. We provide generalization error bounds for linear classifiers trained using gradient descent on unregularized logistic loss in this heavy-tailed setting. Our results show that, under certain conditions on the dimensionality $p$ and the distance between the centers of the distributions, the misclassification error of the maximum margin classifier asymptotically approaches the noise level, the theoretical optimal value. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the learning rate $\beta$ for benign overfitting to occur and show that as the tail heaviness of the input distribution $\alpha$ increases, the upper bound on the learning rate decreases. These results demonstrate that benign overfitting persists even in settings with heavier-tailed inputs than previously studied, contributing to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon in more realistic data environments.</description>

      <title>Preferential Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eliciting a high-dimensional probability distribution from an expert via noisy judgments is notoriously challenging, yet useful for many applications, such as prior elicitation and reward modeling. We introduce a method for eliciting the expert's belief density as a normalizing flow based solely on preferential questions such as comparing or ranking alternatives. This allows eliciting in principle arbitrarily flexible densities, but flow estimation is susceptible to the challenge of collapsing or diverging probability mass that makes it difficult in practice. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel functional prior for the flow, motivated by a decision-theoretic argument, and show empirically that the belief density can be inferred as the function-space maximum a posteriori estimate. We demonstrate our method by eliciting multivariate belief densities of simulated experts, including the prior belief of a general-purpose large language model over a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Which Spaces can be Embedded in $L_p$-type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space? A Characterization via Metric Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel connection between the metric entropy growth and the embeddability of function spaces into reproducing kernel Hilbert/Banach spaces. Metric entropy characterizes the information complexity of function spaces and has implications for their approximability and learnability. Classical results show that embedding a function space into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) implies a bound on its metric entropy growth. Surprisingly, we prove a \textbf{converse}: a bound on the metric entropy growth of a function space allows its embedding to a $L_p-$type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space (RKBS). This shows that the ${L}_p-$type RKBS provides a broad modeling framework for learnable function classes with controlled metric entropies. Our results shed new light on the power and limitations of kernel methods for learning complex function spaces.</description>

      <title>How Transformers Implement Induction Heads: Approximation and Optimization Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning capabilities, yet the theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms remain limited. A recent work (Elhage et al., 2021) identified a "rich" in-context mechanism known as induction head, contrasting with "lazy" $n$-gram models that overlook long-range dependencies. In this work, we provide both approximation and optimization analyses of how transformers implement induction heads. In the approximation analysis, we formalize both standard and generalized induction head mechanisms, and examine how transformers can efficiently implement them, with an emphasis on the distinct role of each transformer submodule. For the optimization analysis, we study the training dynamics on a synthetic mixed target, composed of a 4-gram and an in-context 2-gram component. This setting enables us to precisely characterize the entire training process and uncover an {\em abrupt transition} from lazy (4-gram) to rich (induction head) mechanisms as training progresses.</description>
