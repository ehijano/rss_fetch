      <title>Quantifying the Dynamics of Innovation Abandonment Across Scientific, Technological, Commercial, and Pharmacological Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the vast literature on the diffusion of innovations that impacts a broad range of disciplines, our understanding of the abandonment of innovations remains limited yet is essential for a deeper understanding of the innovation lifecycle. Here, we analyze four large-scale datasets that capture the temporal and structural patterns of innovation abandonment across scientific, technological, commercial, and pharmacological domains. The paper makes three primary contributions. First, across these diverse domains, we uncover one simple pattern of preferential abandonment, whereby the probability for individuals or organizations to abandon an innovation increases with time and correlates with the number of network neighbors who have abandoned the innovation. Second, we find that the presence of preferential abandonment fundamentally alters the way in which the underlying ecosystem breaks down, inducing a novel structural collapse in networked systems commonly perceived as robust against abandonments. Third, we derive an analytical framework to systematically understand the impact of preferential abandonment on network dynamics, pinpointing specific conditions where it may accelerate, decelerate, or have an identical effect compared to random abandonment, depending on the network topology. Together, these results deepen our quantitative understanding of the abandonment of innovation within networked social systems, with implications for the robustness and functioning of innovation communities. Overall, they demonstrate that the dynamics of innovation abandonment follow simple yet reproducible patterns, suggesting that the uncovered preferential abandonment may be a generic property of the innovation lifecycle.</description>

      <title>When a periodic forcing and a time-delayed nonlinear forcing drive a non-delayed Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two systems are coupled, the driver system can function as an external forcing over the driven or response system. Also, an external forcing can independently perturb the driven system, leading us to examine the interplay between the dynamics induced by the driver system and the external forcing acting on the response system. The cooperation of the two external perturbations can induce different kinds of behavior and initiate a resonance phenomenon. Here, we analyze and characterize this resonance phenomenon. Moreover, this resonance may coexist in the parameter set and coincide with other resonances typical of coupled systems, as {\it the transmitted resonance} and {\it the coupling-induced resonance}. Thus, we analyze the outcomes to discern their distinctions and understand when the increase in oscillation amplitudes is attributable to one phenomenon, to one of both the others, or a combination of the three.</description>

      <title>Scaling Particle Collision Data Analysis</title>

Abstract: For decades, researchers have developed task-specific models to address scientific challenges across diverse disciplines. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown enormous capabilities in handling general tasks; however, these models encounter difficulties in addressing real-world scientific problems, particularly in domains involving large-scale numerical data analysis, such as experimental high energy physics. This limitation is primarily due to BPE tokenization's inefficacy with numerical data. In this paper, we propose a task-agnostic architecture, BBT-Neutron, which employs a binary tokenization method to facilitate pretraining on a mixture of textual and large-scale numerical experimental data. We demonstrate the application of BBT-Neutron to Jet Origin Identification (JoI), a critical categorization challenge in high-energy physics that distinguishes jets originating from various quarks or gluons. Our results indicate that BBT-Neutron achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific JoI models. Furthermore, we examine the scaling behavior of BBT-Neutron's performance with increasing data volume, suggesting the potential for BBT-Neutron to serve as a foundational model for particle physics data analysis, with possible extensions to a broad spectrum of scientific computing applications for Big Science experiments, industrial manufacturing and spacial computing.
