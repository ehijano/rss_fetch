      <title>Developing a Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential for Non-Covalent Interactions in Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient modeling of molecular interactions with quantum mechanical (QM) accuracy. However, constructing robust and representative training datasets that capture subtle, system-specific interaction motifs remains challenging. We introduce PANIP (PAirwise Non-covalent Interaction Potential), an ensemble MLIP model built upon the NequIP framework and trained on non-covalent interactions (NCIs) between protein-derived fragments. PANIP is trained using an automated multi-fidelity active learning (MFAL) workflow, in which a representative training subset, termed PDB-FRAGID (PDB Fragment Interaction Dataset), was distilled from an otherwise prohibitively large pool of fragment dimers extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PANIP retains {\omega}B97X-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP-level accuracy and achieves mean absolute errors below 0.2 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution systems, demonstrating excellent transferability across diverse NCI motifs. Compared to the widely used ANI-2x potential, PANIP delivers substantially lower errors, particularly for charged and strongly interacting dimers. Coupled with a fragmentation-based energy decomposition scheme, PANIP estimates protein-ligand binding energies at near force-field computational cost yet QM-level accuracy, enabling its use as a fragment-based scoring function that rivals specialized docking scoring functions.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent for User-friendly Chemical Process Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern process simulators enable detailed process design, simulation, and optimization; however, constructing and interpreting simulations is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework's capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent density functional theory study of strong-field laser-induced coulomb explosion of the HCl dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a channel-resolved interpretation of laser-driven Coulomb explosion of the HCl dimer from an ensemble of trajectories. Three dominant outcomes are identified: a minor three-body channel and two four-body channels (sequential and near-simultaneous dissociation of both molecules). The key result is that pathway selection is strongly correlated with the degree of ionization during the laser interaction, which is in turn strongly modulated by laser-molecule orientation. Higher early-time ionization predisposes the system toward near-simultaneous four-body breakup, whereas lower ionization favors sequential and three-body fragmentation; for low-ionization cases, a fragment-resolved charge metric further differentiates three-body and sequential behavior. These charge-dependent trends consistently map onto experimentally accessible observables: the simultaneous mechanism dominates the high-energy tail of the kinetic energy release (KER) spectrum and populate distinct regions of the emission-angle distributions, while sequential events concentrate at lower KER. Overall, early-time charge evolution provides a unifying explanation for channel branching and for the channel-resolved fragmentation signatures.</description>

      <title>Extension of the CIPSI-Driven CC($P$;$Q$) Approach to Excited Electronic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the CIPSI-driven CC($P$;$Q$) methodology [K. Gururangan et al., J. Chem. Phys. 155 (2021) 174114], in which the leading higher-than-doubly excited determinants are identified using the selected configuration interaction (CI) approach abbreviated as CIPSI, to excited electronic states via the equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) formalism. By examining vertical excitations in CH+ at equilibrium and stretched geometries, adiabatic excitations in CH, and ground- and excited-state potential cuts of water, we demonstrate that the CIPSI-driven CC($P$;$Q$) method converges parent CC/EOMCC singles, doubles, and triples energetics from relatively inexpensive Hamiltonian diagonalizations in CI spaces smaller than the corresponding triples manifolds.</description>

      <title>Towards accurate predictions of bond-selective fluorescence spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational-encoded fluorescence spectro-microscopies are emerging as powerful tools for studying molecular vibrations with the unparalleled sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy. We recently described one such technique, termed bond-selective fluorescence-detected infrared-excited (BonFIRE) spectro-microscopy. Currently, prospects of BonFIRE towards rational molecular design are limited, but they have the potential to be assisted by computational tools. In this Perspective, we provide a brief overview of the theory of BonFIRE spectroscopy. We then describe a fully automated computational pipeline for calculating BonFIRE spectra, reproducing key features of experimental results. Finally, we highlight a few potential applications of computational methods for vibrational-encoded fluorescence spectro-microscopies and their broader implications for chemistry and biology.</description>

      <title>Full Reaction Pathway Dynamics for Atmospheric Decomposition Reactions: The Photodissociation of H$_2$COO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branching ratios for fragmentation channels of important meta- and unstable species are essential for a molecular-level characterization of atmospheric chemistry. Here, the molecular product channels for the decomposition dynamics of the smallest Criegee intermediate, H$_2$COO, are quantitatively investigated. Using a high-quality, full-dimensional machine learned potential energy surface (CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ), the translational, rotational, and vibrational energy distributions of the CO$_2$+H$_2$, H$_2$O+CO, and HCO+OH fragmentation channels were analyzed to elucidate partitioning of the available energy. The CO$_2$ + H$_2$ product forms through two different pathways that bifurcate after formation of the OCH$_2$O intermediate. Along the direct pathway, CO$_2$ is preferentially vibrationally excited with H$_2$in its vibrational ground state, whereas for the indirect pathway going through formic acid, H$_2$ can populate levels with $v &gt; 0$. For all product channels passing through energized formic acid, the lifetime distributions are described by stretched exponentials with $\beta$ ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. This is a clear signature of non-RRKM effects and suggests that the explicit molecular dynamics needs to be followed for a quantitative and realistic description of the photodissociation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Simplified Range-Separation Tuning as a Practical Starting Point for G0W0 and Bethe-Salpeter Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of one-shot $G_0W_0$ and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is well known to be highly sensitive to the choice of the starting-point eigensystem, typically obtained from mean-field theory. A highly effective method explored is the use of density functional approximation (DFA) with a range-separated hybrid (RSH) approach.
  In this work, we evaluate the performance of $G_0W_0$ in predicting ionization potentials and the BSE for describing neutral excitations, employing a recently proposed, broadly applicable, and computationally efficient range-separation tuning scheme [Singh \textit{et. al.}, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 16, 32, 8198-8208, (2025)]. Our results demonstrate that this simplified tuning protocol provides an accurate starting point for many-body perturbation theory, thereby eliminating the need for conventional, multi-step optimally tuned RSH optimization procedure. The resulting quasiparticle energies from $G_0W_0$ closely reproduce reference ionization potentials, while BSE calculations based on the same tuned RSH orbitals yield quantitatively accurate optical absorption spectra and excitonic properties across a range of molecular systems and clusters.</description>

      <title>Learning to Dock: Geometric Deep Learning for Predicting Supramolecular Host-Guest Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting non-covalent host-guest recognition remains challenging due to the complex interplay of electrostatics, dispersion, and steric effects, and the limited transferability of existing docking approaches to synthetic supramolecular systems. Here we present DeepHostGuest, a geometric deep-learning framework that learns generalizable recognition principles directly from experimentally resolved host-guest structures. Hosts are encoded as electrostatic surfaces and guests as molecular graphs, enabling transferable learning across diverse supramolecular systems. DeepHostGuest achieves high-accuracy predictions (RMSD $\leq 2$ Angstrom for 80.8% of test cases), substantially outperforming classical docking without case-specific tuning. Notably, the method generalizes beyond its training domain to crystalline sponge systems, accurately capturing the binding of large amphiphilic molecules within metal-organic cages. Beyond predicting binding conformations, the structures generated by DeepHostGuest serve as a reliable basis for accurate binding free-energy calculations. Density Functional Theory (DFT)-calculated affinities correlate well with experiment, enabling structure-property relationships across 876 host-guest complexes spanning 34 host families. Interpretable feature analysis reveals that binding strength arises from a cooperative interplay of host polarity, guest hydrophobicity, and geometric complementarity, with distinct design regimes across supramolecular classes. Together, these results establish data-driven molecular recognition as a practical route to predictive supramolecular design, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and rational optimization of functional host-guest systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic principles of emerging cryopreservation technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cryopreservation exists at the convergence of diverse disciplines--materials science, physical chemistry, mechanical engineering, biological engineering, etc.--and emerging technologies often draw from many of these disciplines simultaneously. Thermodynamics, as one of the foundational theories underlying both physical and biological science, provides a framework through which to understand these interdisciplinary technologies, yet the full kit of requisite thermodynamic tools is not housed within any one discipline. This Chapter aims to articulate a foundational thermodynamic approach to the description, interrogation, and design of modern cryopreservation technologies, and to review the state of the art in emerging cryopreservation technologies through the lens of this approach. We focus in particular on the management of phase change across equilibrium-driven techniques (e.g., liquidus tracking, partial freezing, isochoric freezing), kinetics-driven techniques (e.g. supercooling, ice seeding), and transport-driven techniques (e.g. directional freezing, droplet approaches), and we hope to equip the reader with a self-consistent theoretical toolkit that enables meaningful comparison of these techniques from a thermodynamic perspective.</description>

      <title>onepot CORE -- an enumerated chemical space to streamline drug discovery, enabled by automated small molecule synthesis and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design-make-test-analyze cycle in early-stage drug discovery remains constrained primarily by the "make" step: small-molecule synthesis is slow, costly, and difficult to scale or automate across diverse chemotypes. Enumerated chemical spaces aim to reduce this bottleneck by predefining synthesizable regions of chemical space from available building blocks and reliable reactions, yet existing commercial spaces are still limited by long turnaround times, narrow reaction scope, and substantial manual decision-making in route selection and execution.
  Here we present the first version of onepot CORE, an enumerated chemical space containing 3.4B molecules and corresponding on-demand synthesis product enabled by an automated synthesis platform and an AI chemist, Phil, that designs, executes, and analyzes experiments. onepot CORE is constructed by (i) selecting a reaction set commonly used in medicinal chemistry, (ii) sourcing and curating building blocks from supplier catalogs, (iii) enumerating candidate products, and (iv) applying ML-based feasibility assessment to prioritize compounds for robust execution. In the current release, the space is supported by seven reactions.
  We describe an end-to-end workflow - from route selection and automated liquid handling through workup and purification. We further report validation across operational metrics (success rate, timelines, purity, and identity), including NMR confirmation for a representative set of synthesized compounds and assay suitability demonstrated using a series of DPP4 inhibitors. Collectively, onepot CORE illustrates a path toward faster, more reliable access to diverse small molecules, supporting accelerated discovery in pharmaceuticals and beyond.</description>

      <title>Reorienting off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB) via Minimum Mode Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states remains central to understanding reaction kinetics. Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces. Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms. These results establish RONEB as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery.</description>

      <title>Real-time visualization of plasmonic nanoparticle growth dynamics by high-speed atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoparticles generate strongly localized and enhanced light field through localized surface plasmon resonance, thereby playing a central role in plasmonics and nanophotonics. Because the optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles are highly sensitive to their size and shape, nanoscale visualization of nanoparticle growth is crucial for detailed understanding of growth mechanisms and precise control of particle geometry. However, it is not possible to visualize the rapid growth dynamics using conventional imaging techniques. In this study, we demonstrate in-situ real-time observation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) growth dynamics at the single-particle level using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). We employed a photoreduction method, which enables reliable control of AgNP formation by laser irradiation. By integrating a stand-alone tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical setup for photoreduction, we successfully captured real-time movies showing the nucleation and subsequent growth of AgNPs at the single-particle level. Furthermore, quantitative single-particle analysis revealed particle-to-particle variations in growth dynamics. The growth dynamics were further studied at different laser intensities, revealing intensity-dependent growth rates and the balance between nucleation and growth. This study establishes HS-AFM as a novel microscopic platform for in-situ visualization of plasmonic nanoparticle growth and will contribute to advances in plasmonics and materials science.</description>

      <title>DDCCNet: Physics-enhanced Multitask Neural Networks for Data-driven Coupled-cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the data-driven coupled-cluster deep network (DDCCNet), a family of multitask, physics-enhanced deep learning architectures designed to predict coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) amplitudes and correlation energies from lower-level electronic structure methods. The three DDCCNet variants (termed as v1, v2, and v3) progressively incorporate architectural refinements ranging from parallel subnetworks for t_1 and t_2 amplitudes to feature-partitioned blocks and physics-enhanced intermediate prediction layers that are structured in accordance with coupled-cluster equations to enhance physical consistency and multitask learning efficiency. These models jointly learn correlated amplitude patterns while embedding symmetry and orbital-level interactions directly into the network structure. Applied to methanol conformers, CO2 clusters, and small organic molecules, DDCCNet_v2 delivered the most accurate and transferable performance, achieving chemically precise correlation energies across diverse molecular systems. Collectively, DDCCNet establishes a scalable, physically grounded framework that unifies machine learning and ab initio theory for efficient, data-driven electronic structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Chemical Reactions in Optical Cavities: A Complex Interplay of Mode Hybridization, Timescale Balance, and Pathway Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing strong light-matter interactions to control chemical reactions in confined electromagnetic fields offers a promising route toward deepening our understanding of chemical dynamics at the collective quantum-mechanical level, with potential implications for future chemical synthesis paradigms. Achieving this goal, however, requires an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamical processes. As a step in this direction, we present a systematic and numerically exact quantum dynamical study of cooperative reaction dynamics inside an optical microcavity. Using a hierarchy of model systems with increasing complexity, we elucidate how cavity-modified reactivity emerges from-and is highly sensitive to-subtle structural and environmental variations. Our models consist of optically dark reactive molecules, each represented by a symmetric double well potential, coupled to infrared-active non-reactive intramolecular or solvent vibrational modes, as well as their respective dissipative environments. Our results demonstrate that cavity-induced rate modifications arise from a delicate interplay among mode hybridization in strong-coupling regimes, the dynamical balance of all participating energy exchange processes, and quantum interference between multiple fluctuation-dissipation-mediated reaction pathways enabled by collective cavity coupling. By continuously tuning a single system parameter or introducing molecular collectivity, we observe qualitatively distinct rate modification profiles as functions of the cavity frequency, including resonant rate enhancement, resonant rate suppression, hybridization-induced peak splitting, and, notably, asymmetric Fano-type line shapes in which enhancement peaks and suppression dips coexist within a narrow resonance window, highlighting the important role of quantum interference in cavity-modified chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Automated Analysis of DFT Output Files for Molecular Descriptor Extraction and Reactivity Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between molecular structure and chemical reactivity or properties is fundamental to rational molecular design. Linear free energy relationships (LFERs), particularly Hammett analysis, have long served as powerful tools in organic chemistry. Recently, these approaches have been enhanced by incorporating computationally derived parameters, enabling broader applicability across diverse molecules and reactions. To facilitate and scale this process, we present DFTDescriptorPipeline, a fully automated workflow for extracting quantum chemical descriptors from Gaussian log files and constructing structure-property and structure-reactivity relationships using multivariate linear regression (MLR) models. We validate the workflow across four case studies, including photoswitchable molecules and catalytic reactions. In each case, the models provide interpretable results, demonstrating the versatility of this approach and its relevance to a wide range of chemical contexts. We anticipate that this platform will serve as a generalizable framework for integrating quantum chemical calculations into data-driven molecular design.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring the properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because it allows for precise control of radical and ion energies and fluxes. For chalcogen substitution, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization through thermal chemisorption significantly lowers the sputtering energy threshold ($E_{sputt}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 35$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV. In addition, we find that a non-orthogonal impact angle $\sim 30{}^{\circ}$ reduces the sputtering energy threshold, while cryogenic-range TMD temperatures may increase. To explain the observed trends, a multi-step sputtering mechanism is proposed. Our results show that oxygen/fluorine functionalization, impact angle, and material temperature are key control parameters for selective, damage-free chalcogen removal in TMD processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP-PAW is a combined electronic structure and ab-initio molecular dynamics code to perform mixed quantum and classical simulations of atomistic condensed phase systems, such as solids, liquids, and molecular systems. As the name suggests, the CP-PAW code unifies the all-electron projector augmented-wave method with the Car-Parrinello approach to determine not only the electronic and nuclear ground state of condensed matter, but also to study their properties and dynamics. In addition to briefly outlining the underlying theory, the focus will be on unique aspects of CP-PAW and how to correctly employ them as a user. How to install CP-PAW using the new build system will also be briefly mentioned.</description>

Abstract: In a recent letter [T. D. K\"uhne, M. Krack, F. Mohamed and M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 066401 (2007)], we outlined a new Car-Parrinello-like approach to Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. Here, we provide a guide to performing actual calculations using our method and demonstrate this on liquid water at ambient conditions. We do not go into methodological details beyond those necessary for applying this approach, but focus on practical details pertinent to our particular implementation within the CP2K/Quickstep code [T. D. K\"uhne et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)].</description>

      <title>Atomic Alignment in PbS Nanocrystal Superlattices with Compact Inorganic Ligands via Reversible Oriented Attachment of Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanocrystals (NCs) serve as versatile building blocks for the creation of functional materials, with NC self-assembly offering opportunities to enable novel material properties. Here, we demonstrate that PbS NCs functionalized with strongly negatively charged metal chalcogenide complex (MCC) ligands, such as $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$ and $AsS_4^{3-}$, can self-assemble into all-inorganic superlattices with both long-range superlattice translational and atomic-lattice orientational order. Structural characterizations reveal that the NCs adopt unexpected edge-to-edge alignment, and numerical simulation clarifies that orientational order is thermodynamically stabilized by many-body ion correlations originating from the dense electrolyte. Furthermore, we show that the superlattices of $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$-functionalized PbS NCs can be fully disassembled back into the colloidal state, which is highly unusual for orientationally attached superlattices with atomic-lattice alignment. The reversible oriented attachment of NCs, enabling their dynamic assembly and disassembly into effectively single-crystalline superstructures, offers a pathway toward designing reconfigurable materials with adaptive and controllable electronic and optoelectronic properties.</description>

      <title>A non-equilibrium strategy for the general synthesis of single-atom catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) maximize atom efficiency and exhibit unique electronic structures, yet realizing precise and scalable atomic dispersion remains a key challenge. Here, we report a non-equilibrium strategy for the scalable synthesis of SACs via ion implantation, enabling precise stabilization of metal atoms on diverse supports. Using an industrial-grade ion source, wafer-scale ion implantation with milliampere-level beam currents enables high-throughput fabrication of SACs, while the synergistic energy-mass effects stabilize isolated metal atoms in situ. A library of 36 SACs was constructed, and the resulting Pt/MoS2 exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution performance with an overpotential of only 26 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and exceptional long-term stability, surpassing commercial Pt/C. This work demonstrates ion implantation as a versatile platform bridging fundamental SACs design and scalable manufacturing, providing new opportunities for high-performance catalysts in energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>INTERFACE Force Field for Alumina with Validated Bulk Phases and a pH-Resolved Surface Model Database for Electrolyte and Organic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alumina and aluminum oxyhydroxides underpin chemical-engineering technologies from heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion protection, functional coatings, energy-storage devices, to biomedical components. Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude. Relative to ML-DFT workflows, the speed 100 to 1000 times faster, reaching system sizes and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods. The results establish a predictive computational platform to design alumina-containing functional materials under realistic process conditions.</description>

      <title>Generating Cyclic Conformers with Flow Matching in Cremer-Pople Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic molecules are ubiquitous across applications in chemistry and biology. Their restricted conformational flexibility provides structural pre-organization that is key to their function in drug discovery and catalysis. However, reliably sampling the conformer ensembles of ring systems remains challenging. Here, we introduce PuckerFlow, a generative machine learning model that performs flow matching on the Cremer-Pople space, a low-dimensional internal coordinate system capturing the relevant degrees of freedom of rings. Our approach enables generation of valid closed rings by design and demonstrates strong performance in generating conformers that are both diverse and precise. We show that PuckerFlow outperforms other conformer generation methods on nearly all quantitative metrics and illustrate the potential of PuckerFlow for ring systems relevant to chemical applications, particularly in catalysis and drug discovery. This work enables efficient and reliable conformer generation of cyclic structures, paving the way towards modeling structure-property relationships and the property-guided generation of rings across a wide range of applications in chemistry and biology.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Prediction of Polymer Relaxation Dynamics via Computational and Data-Driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiscale modeling approach that integrates molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to investigate the glass transition dynamics of polymer systems. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of four representative polymers are estimated using simulations and machine learning model trained on experimental datasets. These predicted Tg values are used as inputs to the ECNLE theory to compute the temperature dependence of structural relaxation times and diffusion coefficients, and the dynamic fragility. The Tg values predicted from simulations show good quantitative agreement with experimental data. While machine learning tends to slightly overestimate Tg, the resulting dynamic fragility values remain close to experimental fragilities. Overall, ECNLE calculations using these inputs agree well with broadband dielectric spectroscopy results. Our integrated approach provides a practical and scalable tool for predicting the dynamic behavior of polymers, particularly in systems where experimental data are limited.</description>

      <title>Comparison between explicit and implicit discretization strategies for a dissipative thermal environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate strategies for simulating open quantum systems coupled to dissipative baths by comparing explicit wave function-based discretization [via multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH)] and the implicit density matrix-based master equation method [via tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion (TTN-HEOM)]. For dissipative baths characterized by exponentially decaying bath correlation functions, the implicit discretization approach of HEOM -- rooted in bath correlation function decompositions -- proves significantly more efficient than explicit discretization of the bath into discrete harmonic modes. Explicit methods, like ML-MCTDH, require extensive mode discretization to approximate continuum baths, leading to computational bottlenecks. Case studies for two-level systems and a Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex model highlight TTN-HEOM's superiority in capturing dissipative dynamics with relaxations with a minimal number of auxiliary modes, while the explicit methods are as exact as the HEOM in pure dephasing regimes. This comparison is enabled by the TENSO package, which has both ML-MCTDH and TTN-HEOM implemented using the same computational structure and propagation strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of lattice-gas systems defined on semiregular grids, obtained by projecting the vertices of three different geodesic icosahedra onto a spherical surface. By using couplings up to third neighbors we explore various interaction patterns, ranging from core-corona repulsion to square-well attraction and short-range attractive, long-range repulsive potentials. The relatively small number of sites in each grid ($\sim 100$) enables us to compute the exact statistical properties of the systems as a function of temperature and chemical potential by Wang-Landau sampling. For each case considered we highlight the existence of distinct low-temperature ``phases'', featuring, among others, regular-polyhedral, cluster-crystal, and worm-like structures. We highlight similarities and differences between these motifs and those observed on the triangular lattice under the same conditions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results for the bottom-up realization of spherical templates with desired functionalities.</description>

      <title>Insights into $CO_{2}$ activation on defective ZnS surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate $CO_{2}$ activation on ZnS using Near Ambient-Pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (NAP-XPS) and density functional theory calculations (DFT). Our NAP-XPS experiments reveal that $CO_{2}$ adsorbs onto a defective ZnS surface upon heating above $473 \ K$ in a $CO_{2}$ atmosphere (up to $0.55 \ mbar$). The $CO_{2}$ adsorption fingerprint is detectable even after cooling to room temperature under ultra-high vacuum. Our DFT calculations suggest that $CO_{2}$ adsorption is energetically favorable on ZnS surfaces containing zinc vacancies, highlighting defect sites as key adsorption centers. Additionally, oxygen adsorption on a defective ZnS surface is exothermic, in contrast to the endothermic behavior observed on a defect-free surface. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of defect-driven surface reactivity and may inform ZnS-based catalyst's design for $CO_{2}$ capture and reutilization.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective fluorescent molecule design with a data-physics dual-driven generative framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing fluorescent small molecules with tailored optical and physicochemical properties requires navigating vast, underexplored chemical space while satisfying multiple objectives and constraints. Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design.</description>

      <title>Theory for Entangled-Photons Stimulated Raman Scattering versus Nonlinear Absorption for Polyatomic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement offers an incredible resource for enhancing the sensing and spectroscopic probes. Here we develop a microscopic theory for the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) using entangled photons. We demonstrate that the time-energy correlation of the photon pairs can optimize the signal for polyatomic molecules. Our results show that the spectral-line intensity of the entangled-photon SRS (ESRS) is of the same order of magnitude as the one for the entangled two-photon absorption (ETPA); the parameter window is thus identified to do so. Moreover, the vibrational coherence is found to play an important role for enhancing the ESRS against the ETPA intensity. Our work paves a firm road for extending the schemes of molecular spectroscopy with quantum light, based on the observation of the ETPA in experiments.</description>

      <title>Onset of stripe order in classical fluids: Lessons from lattice-gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two molecular species with mutual affinity are mixed together, various self-assembled phases can arise at low temperature, depending on the shape of like and unlike interactions. Among them, stripes -- where layers of one type are regularly alternated with layers of another type -- hold a prominent place in materials science, occurring e.g. in the structure of superconductive doped antiferromagnets. Stripe patterns are relevant for the design of functional materials, with applications in optoelectronics, sensing, and biomedicine. In a purely classical setting, an open question pertains to the features that spherically-symmetric particle interactions must have to foster stripe order. Here we address this challenge for a lattice-gas mixture of two particle species, whose equilibrium properties are exactly determined by Monte Carlo simulations with Wang-Landau sampling, in both planar and spherical geometry, and for equal chemical potentials of the species. Somewhat surprisingly, stripes can emerge from largely different off-core interactions, featuring various combinations of repulsive like interactions with a predominantly attractive unlike interaction. In addition to stripes, our survey also unveils crystals and crystal-like structures, cluster crystals, and networks, which considerably broaden the catalog of possible patterns. Overall, our study demonstrates that stripes are more widespread than generally thought, as they can be generated by several distinct mechanisms, thereby explaining why stripe patterns are observed in systems as diverse as cuprate materials, biomaterials, and nanoparticle films.</description>

      <title>Vib2Mol: from vibrational spectra to molecular structures-a unified deep learning framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There will be a paradigm shift in chemical and biological research, to be enabled by autonomous, closed-loop, real-time self-directed decision-making experimentation. Spectrum-to-structure correlation, which is to elucidate molecular structures with spectral information, is the core step in understanding the experimental results and to close the loop. However, current approaches usually divide the task into either database-dependent retrieval and database-independent generation and neglect the inherent complementarity between them. In this study, we proposed Vib2Mol, a unified deep learning framework designed to flexibly handle diverse spectrum-to-structure tasks according to the available prior knowledge by bridging the retrieval and generation. Empowered by our coarse-to-fine retrieval and generate-then-rerank strategies, Vib2Mol not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in analyzing theoretical Infrared and Raman spectra, but also outperform previous models on experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising capabilities in predicting reaction products and sequencing peptides, enabling vibrational spectroscopy a potential guide for autonomous scientific discovery workflows.</description>

      <title>Finite elements and moving asymptotes accelerate quantum optimal control -- FEMMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control is central to designing spin manipulation pulses. Gradient-based pulse optimization can be facilitated by either accelerating gradient evaluation or enhancing the convergence rate. In this work, we accelerated single-spin optimal control by combining the finite element method with the method of moving asymptotes. By treating discretized time as spatial coordinates, the Liouville - von Neumann equation was reformulated as a linear system, efficiently yielding a joint solution of the spin trajectory and control gradient. The method of moving asymptotes, relying on the ensemble fidelities and gradients, achieves rapid convergence for a target fidelity of 0.995.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal van der Waals density functional made faster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simplification of the VV10 van der Waals density functional [J. Chem. Phys. 133, 244103 (2010)] is made by an approximation of the integrand of the six-dimentional integral in terms of a few products of three-dimensional density-like distributions and potential-like functions of the interelectronic distance only, opening the way for its straightforward computation by fast multipole methods. An even faster computational scheme for molecular systems is implemented where the density-like distributions are fitted by linear combinations of usual atom-centered basis functions of Gaussian type and the six-dimensional integral is then computed analytically, at a fraction of the overall cost of a typical calculation. The simplicity of the new approximation is commensurate with that of the original VV10 functional, and the same level of accuracy is seen in tests on molecules.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics Reconstructed from Information Theory:An Axiomatic Framework via Information-Volume Constraints and Path-Space KL Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an axiomatic reconstruction of thermodynamics based entirely on two primitive components: a description of what aspects of a system are observed and a reference measure that encodes the underlying descriptive convention. These ingredients define an "information volume" for each observational cell.
  By incorporating the logarithm of this volume as an additional constraint in a minimum-relative-entropy inference scheme, temperature, chemical potential, and pressure arise as conjugate variables of a single information-theoretic functional. This leads to a Legendre-type structure and a first-law-like relation in which pressure corresponds to information volume rather than geometric volume.
  For nonequilibrium dynamics, entropy production is characterized through the relative-entropy asymmetry between forward and time-reversed stochastic evolutions. A decomposition using observational entropy then separates total dissipation into system and environment contributions. Heat is defined as the part of dissipation not accounted for by the system-entropy change, yielding a representation that does not rely on local detailed balance or a specific bath model. We further show that the difference between joint and partially observed dissipation equals the average of conditional relative entropies, providing a unified interpretation of hidden dissipation and information-flow terms as projection-induced gaps.</description>

      <title>IEPDYN: Integral-equation formalism of population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the integral-equation formalism of population dynamics (IEPDYN) to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The IEPDYN method is formulated in continuous time and therefore does not rely on a coarse-grained timescale (lag time). Consequently, kinetic quantities obtained from IEPDYN are free from lag-time dependence, which has been discussed as a limitation in other approaches. We apply the IEPDYN method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the IEPDYN method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the IEPDYN method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding systems whose characteristic timescales are far beyond those directly accessible by brute-force MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Denoising Model for Molecular Structure Optimization with Chemical Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for molecular structure optimization using denoising model on a physics-informed Riemannian manifold (R-DM). Unlike conventional approaches operating in Euclidean space, our method leverages a Riemannian metric that better aligns with molecular energy change, enabling more robust modeling of potential energy surfaces. By incorporating internal coordinates reflective of energetic properties, R-DM achieves chemical accuracy with an energy error below 1 kcal/mol. Comparative evaluations on QM9, QM7-X, and GEOM datasets demonstrate improvements in both structural and energetic accuracy, surpassing conventional Euclidean-based denoising models. This approach highlights the potential of physics-informed coordinates for tackling complex molecular optimization problems, with implications for tasks in computational chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic Verlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate two characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is the one best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-phonon polarons in a chiral molecular qubit framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. These quasiparticles are speculated to be the origin of chirality-induced spin selectivity and presumably can display exotic dynamic behaviors. However, direct experimental evidence of spin-phonon polarons has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests itself as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence or quantum sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Transfer tensor analysis of localization in the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the transfer tensor method to analyze localization and transport in simple disordered systems, specifically the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models. Emphasis is placed on the memory effects that emerge when ensemble-averaging over disorder, even when individual trajectories are strictly Markovian. We find that transfer tensor memory effects arise to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called "outgoing-pseudoflux". This work establishes connections between theoretical research on dynamical maps and Markovianity and localization phenomena in physically realizable model systems.</description>
