      <title>Rigid muffin-tin approximation in plane-wave codes for fast modeling of phonon-mediated superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pseudopotential-based plane-wave implementation of the rigid muffin-tin approximation (RMTA), offering a computationally efficient alternative to its traditional use in all-electron codes. This approach enables the evaluation of angular-momentum-resolved electron-phonon matrix elements and McMillan-Hopfield parameters of not only elemental transition metals but also their compounds. The results are benchmarked against full-potential linearized augmented plane wave calculations, showing excellent agreement. We further outline a practical route to extract atom- and symmetry-type-resolved electron-phonon coupling constants. By enabling the use of RMTA descriptors within high-throughput workflows, this framework significantly lowers the computational cost of screening candidate superconductors, providing a valuable tool for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Critical photoinduced reflectivity relaxation dynamics in single-layer Bi-based cuprates near the pseudogap end point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of photoinduced transient reflectivity dynamics in heavily overdoped single-layer cuprate (Bi,Pb)$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Pb-Bi2201), across the end points of the pseudogap and superconducting phases, has been conducted using optical ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. In the Pb-Bi2201 just before reaching the pseudogap end point, the transient reflectivity dynamics above $T_{{\rm c}}$ resemble the pseudogap response observed in optimally doped La-Bi2201. At low temperatures, however, the relaxation time exhibits a power-law divergence, $\tau\sim10\hbar/k_{\mathrm{B}}T$, signaling quantum critical behavior at the pseudogap end point doping. A similar power-law increase in relaxation time is also observed in Pb-Bi2201 just beyond the pseudogap doping end point, though it is less pronounced.</description>

      <title>Edge dependent Josephson Diode effect in WTe$_{2}$-Based Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), a nonreciprocal supercurrent, is a cornerstone for future dissipationless electronics, yet achieving high efficiency in a simple device architecture remains a significant challenge. Here, we theoretically investigate the JDE in a junction based on monolayer 1T'-WTe$_2$. We first establish that different edge terminations of a WTe$_2$ nanoribbon lead to diverse electronic band structures, some of which host asymmetric edge states even with crystallographically equivalent terminations. This intrinsic asymmetry provides a natural platform for realizing the JDE. With a WTe$_2$-based Josephson junction, we demonstrate a significant JDE arising purely from these asymmetric edges when time-reversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic flux. While the efficiency of this edge-state-driven JDE is inherently limited, we discover a crucial mechanism for its enhancement: by tuning the chemical potential into the bulk bands, the interplay between edge and bulk transport channels boosts the maximum diode efficiency more than $50\%$. Furthermore, we show that this enhanced JDE is robust against moderate edge disorder. Our findings not only propose a novel route to achieve a highly efficient JDE using intrinsic material properties but also highlight the potential of engineered WTe$_2$ systems for developing advanced superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Magnetism in Fe-Based Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism constitutes an intriguing phase of matter which breaks inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that the Fe-based superconductors exhibiting coplanar magnetic order realize an odd-parity magnetic state by combining low-energy modeling with density-functional theory. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the electronic spins are polarized along the $k_z$-direction and the splitting of the up and down states exhibits an $h$-wave form-factor. The magnitude of the splitting depends sensitively on specific parameters of the low-energy model, including specific out-of-plane hopping parameters and the Fermi energies of the hole- and electron-pockets. Interestingly, despite this state breaking inversion symmetry and exhibiting a finite out-of-plane Berry curvature and non-linear anomalous Hall effect, the Edelstein effect vanishes. Incorporating spin-orbit coupling tilts the momentum-space electronic spins into the ($k_x,k_y$)-plane and imparts finite in-plane components to the Edelstein response. Our findings highlight the Fe-based superconductors as platforms for exploring odd-parity magnetism both on its own and coexisting with unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of an optical microwave rectification by a superconducting diode with near 100% efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting electronics offer significant advantages in speed and power efficiency for next-generation computing and communication systems. However, their practical deployment is limited by the absence of simple, efficient, and scalable superconducting counterparts to key semiconductor components. In this work, we investigate diodes based on planar Josephson junctions fabricated from a conventional niobium superconductor. The nonreciprocity in these diodes arises from the self-field effect induced by the geometrical asymmetry of the junction. By deliberate tuning of the junction parameters, we achieved effectively infinite nonreciprocity (within experimental resolution), characterized by a complete suppression of the superconducting critical current in one direction while maintaining a significant current in the opposite direction. The key novelty of this work lies in the demonstration of the optical diode effect. We observed threshold-free rectification of 75 GHz microwave radiation, indicating that these diodes exhibit near-ideal optical nonreciprocity. Our results open new avenues for ultrafast superconducting electronics and lay the groundwork for wireless sub-THz signal processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Induced Kekul\'{e} Superconductivity in Haldane phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekul\`{e} superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconducting correlations in fermionic many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</description>

      <title>Displacement-Field-Driven Transition between Superconductivity and Valley Ferromagnetism in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have observed transitions between superconductivity and correlated magnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ near van-Hove fillings, driven by the displacement field $D$. Motivated by the experiment, we theoretically propose a general mechanism for a $D$-controlled transition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit-coupled hexagonal systems, where van Hove singularities (VHS) lie on the Fermi level. We show that such a transition can be naturally captured by a simple VHS-only model without Fermi surface details, where the inter-VHS interactions that govern the Fermi surface instabilities is controlled by $D$ through the band projection of screened Coulomb interaction. By treating this simple model with renormalization group technique beyond mean-field level, we find that a chiral $d/p$-wave superconductivity naturally dominates under a weak displacement field $D&lt;D_c$. At a stronger displacement field $D&gt;D_c$, a \textit{valley ferromagnetic phase} (vFM) takes over, which is spatially non-uniform due to valley-modulated magnetization. Finally, we discuss generic conditions for the predicted superconductivity-to-ferromagnetism transition to take place in the rich family of few-layer hexagonal van der Waals material systems. Taking twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a case study, we discuss experimental detections that can falsify our prediction.</description>

      <title>Exact models of chiral flat-band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</description>

      <title>SCE-NTT: A Hardware Accelerator for Number Theoretic Transform Using Superconductor Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research explores the use of superconductor electronics (SCE) for accelerating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), focusing on the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), a key computational bottleneck in FHE schemes. We present SCE-NTT, a dedicated hardware accelerator based on superconductive single flux quantum (SFQ) logic and memory, targeting high performance and energy efficiency beyond the limits of conventional CMOS. To address SFQ constraints such as limited dense RAM and restricted fanin/fanout, we propose a deeply pipelined NTT-128 architecture using shift register memory (SRM). Designed for N=128 32-bit coefficients, NTT-128 comprises log2(N)=7 processing elements (PEs), each featuring a butterfly unit (BU), dual coefficient memories operating in ping-pong mode via FIFO-based SRM queues, and twiddle factor buffers. The BU integrates a Shoup modular multiplier optimized for a small area, leveraging precomputed twiddle factors. A new RSFQ cell library with over 50 parameterized cells, including compound logic units, was developed for implementation. Functional and timing correctness were validated using JoSIM analog simulations and Verilog models. A multiphase clocking scheme was employed to enhance robustness and reduce path-balancing overhead, improving circuit reliability. Fabricated results show the NTT-128 unit achieves 531 million NTT/sec at 34 GHz, over 100x faster than state-of-the-art CMOS equivalents. We also project that the architecture can scale to larger sizes, such as a 2^14-point NTT in approximately 482 ns. Key-switch throughput is estimated at 1.63 million operations/sec, significantly exceeding existing hardware. These results demonstrate the strong potential of SCE-based accelerators for scalable, energy-efficient secure computation in the post-quantum era, with further gains anticipated through advances in fabrication.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations in magnetized helical edge states coupled to s-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the role of electron-electron interactions in one-dimensional magnetized helical states coupled to an s-wave superconductor. We consider a partially mixed helical (superhelical) regime, where the magnetic field (superconductivity) has a dominant contribution. Using bosonization and renormalization group techniques, it is shown how the interactions affect the correlation functions in the system. In the partially mixed helical regime, we find that superconducting pairing promotes spin-density-wave correlations, while singlet and triplet pairing correlations suppress, especially under attractive interactions. In contrast, in the superhelical regime, a perturbative Zeeman field enhances both spin singlet and spin triplet-x pairings under repulsive interactions. We calculate both logarithmic and residual corrections to charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and pairing correlations, revealing short- and long-range behaviors. We further investigate spin transport properties supplemented by a renormalization group analysis of the temperature and frequency dependence of spin conductivity. We also analyze the transport of momentum-spin-locked carriers in the presence of Zeeman-induced and pairing-induced gaps, uncovering the effect of interactions and the interplay between the two gaps in helical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying nanoscale dynamics is essential for understanding quantum materials and advancing quantum chip manufacturing. Still, it remains a major challenge to measure non-equilibrium properties such as current and dissipation, and their relation to structure. Scanning nanoprobes utilizing superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are uniquely suited here, due to their unparalleled magnetic and thermal sensitivity. Here, we introduce tapping-mode SQUID-on-tip, which combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) with nanoSQUID sensing. Our probes minimize nanoSQUID-sample distance, provide in-plane magnetic sensitivity, and operate without lasers. Frequency multiplexing enables simultaneous imaging of currents, magnetism, dissipation and topography. The large voltage output of our proximity-junction nanoSQUIDs allows us to resolve nanoscale currents as small as 100 nA using a simple four-probe electronic readout without cryogenic amplification. By capturing local magnetic, thermal, and electronic response without external radiation, our technique offers a powerful non-invasive route to study dynamic phenomena in exotic materials and delicate quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Braiding: Topological Superconductivity Unlocked under Nearly Arbitrary Magnetic Field Directions in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero modes (MZM) is central to the fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions (PJJ) are a particularly versatile platform to realize robust topological superconductivity hosting MZM over a large parameter space. However, there is a general understanding that such topological superconductivity is limited to a narrow range of the in-plane magnetic field orientations, providing a major obstacle towards scalable and noncollinear network architectures. Here, we uncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ persists under nearly an arbitrary in-plane magnetic field orientation. The apparent collapse of the global gap under misaligned fields originates not from the destruction of topological superconductivity itself, but from the emergent shifted bulk states from other momenta, which obscure the gap and MZM. With spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore the global topological gap and recover MZM. Remarkably, the spatially modulated PJJ renders topological superconductivity robust against the misaligned fields, thereby enabling MZM survival and facilitating their braiding in complex junction networks. We propose a scalable protocol for MZM braiding and fusion with gate or phase control, opening new routes for scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Effect of Inversion Asymmetry on Bilayer Graphene's Superconducting and Exciton Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inversion asymmetry in bilayer graphene can be tuned by the displacement field. As a result, the band dispersion in biased bilayer graphene acquires flat band regions near the Dirac points along with a non-trivial band geometry. We analyze the effect of inversion symmetry on the critical temperature and superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state of AB-stacked graphene bilayer and on the exciton condensate in double layers formed by two AB-stacked graphene bilayers. The geometric superfluid stiffness in bilayer graphene superconductors is found to be negligible due to the small superconducting gap. Furthermore, we show that the geometric superfluid stiffness is maximized for a constant order parameter. Therefore, it can be neglected in biased bilayer graphene superconductors with any pairing symmetry. However, the displacement field enhances the geometric superfluid stiffness in exciton condensates. It is most prominent at low densities and high displacement fields. A consequence of the geometric superfluid stiffness is a modest enhancement of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature in bilayer graphene's exciton condensate.</description>

      <title>The microwave phase locking in Bloch transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on observation of two coherent quantum phenomena, the current quantization in theJosephson Junction (JJ) and the Aharonov-Cashier effect. The synergy of two effects is seen as the phase locking of the JJ with the oscillating charge engaged by the microwaves (the current quantization), and a control of the phase locking phenomenon with the static charge of the gate electrode (the Aharonov-Cashier effect). The experimental system consists of two coupled JJs in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. When the microwave is applied, the quantized current plateaus appear on the I - V curve. The effect is dual to the Shapiro voltage steps in JJs. We modulate the quantized current with the static charge induced by the gate electrode. Conceptually, the system has the functionality of the Bloch Transistor: it can deliver gate-controlled quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit.</description>

      <title>Consistent quantum treatments of non-convex kinetic energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in nonlinear capacitors or classical time crystals) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. There occurs a dissipative phase transition from a nonconvex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. Our approach thus resolves apparent inconsistencies and provides computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.</description>
