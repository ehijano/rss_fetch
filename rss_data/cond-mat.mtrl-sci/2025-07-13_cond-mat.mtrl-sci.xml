      <title>Unveiling the electronic structure of the charge density wave and topological semimetal TaTe4 through high-field magnetotransport measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$, a charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, offers a platform to explore this interplay. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ via high-field magnetotransport measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Using three distinct field-current configurations, we resolve four out of five FS pockets predicted in the CDW phase, with no evidence of residual non-CDW features - in contrast to recent ARPES studies. Remarkably, we identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical hole pocket and a high-frequency quantum oscillation contribution to the magnetoresistance attributable to magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29 eV. Additionally, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance (MR) for all field orientations when current flows along the $a-$axis, with a distinct high-field linear MR regime emerging near the $c-$axis, consistent with FS hot spots and magnetic breakdown. Our results establish TaTe$_4$ as a paradigmatic system where CDW-driven FS reconstruction governs the bulk electronic structure, enabling new routes to probe the novel physics that can arise in the intersection between correlated electronic states and topological band features.</description>

      <title>Corner-Sharing PS$_4$-BS$_4$ Modes Facilitate Fast Ion Conduction in Lithium Thioborophosphate Iodide Glassy Solid Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassy solid electrolytes (GSEs), with their amorphous nature and the absence of grain boundaries, make them highly attractive for applications in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), a leading candidate for next-generation energy storage technologies. A recently developed lithium thioborophosphate iodide GSE, composed of 30Li$_2$S-25B$_2$S$_3$-45LiI-5P$_2$S$_5$ (LBPSI), has demonstrated excellent room-temperature ionic conductivity and low activation energy. Despite this exciting finding, the underlying mechanism behind this ultrafast ion transport remains ambiguous. Here, we accurately fine-tune the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and perform large-scale machine learning molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural and ion dynamics in LBPSI GSE. Our results reveal that B$_2$S$_3$ glass formers primarily form multi-bridged B$_x$S$_y$ long-chain networks that impede Li$^+$ conduction. In contrast, P$_2$S$_5$ gives rise to mono-tetrahedral PS$_4$$^{3-}$ and di-tetrahedral P$_2$S$_7$$^{4-}$ tetrahedra, which engage in distinctive corner-sharing modes with BS$_4$$^{5-}$ tetrahedra, effectively disrupting the B$_x$S$_y$ chains and enhancing Li$^+$ mobility. Furthermore, the polyhedral anion rotations of PS$_4$$^{3-}$ and BS$_4$$^{5-}$ in the corner-sharing PS$_4$-BS$_4$ motifs may further promote fast Li$^+$ conduction.</description>

      <title>Sensitive infrared surface photovoltage in quasi-equilibrium in a layered semiconductor at low-intensity low-temperature condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefit to layer-dependent bandgap, van der Waals materials with surface photovoltaic effect (SPV) enable photodetection over a tunable wavelength range with low power consumption. However, sensitive SPV in the infrared region, especially in a quasi-steady illumination condition, is still elusive in layered semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report a sensitive SPV in quasi-equilibrium in NbSi0.5Te2, with photoresponsivity up to 2.4*10^6 V/(W*cm^(-2)) at low intensity low temperature condition (LILT). The sensitive SPV is further confirmed by observing the Dember effect, where the photogenerated carrier density is high enough and diffusion currents suppress SPV. Temperature-dependent measurements indicate that intrinsic carriers freezing at low temperature leads to the ultrahigh photoresponse, while a small amount of photon-generated carriers in quasi-equilibrium dominate the system. Our work not only provides a promising layered semiconductor for Infrared optoelectronic devices with strong infrared SPV at LILT, which has application potential in fields such as quantum information and deep-space exploration, but also paves a novel way to enhance light-matter interaction effect by freezing bulk carriers.</description>

      <title>Rocksalt rare-earth monoxides as electronic and magnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable binary rare earth (RE) oxides are usually trivalent RE ion sesquioxides (RE2O3), that are highly insulating and either nonmagnetic or antiferromagnetic. On the other hand, rocksalt-type divalent RE ion monoxides (REOs) have been scarcely synthesized owing to their metastable nature. Accordingly, their fundamental properties have not been unveiled. Recently, thin film epitaxy was successfully applied to synthesize various REOs. In stark contrast with RE2O3, REOs are highly electrically conducting, and exhibit superconductivity, room temperature ferromagnetism, and so on. Therefore, REOs are new and simple f-electron system, promising as electronic, magnetic, and spintronic materials. In this review, their fundamental properties are introduced, and their significance and future prospects are discussed toward a new paradigm in f-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic and optical properties of the thio-apatites phases Ba$_5$(VS$_{\alpha}$O$_{\beta}$)$_3$X [X=Cl, F, Br, I]: impact of multiple anionic substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study of the electronic structure and optical properties of the thio-apatites Ba$_5$(VS$_{\alpha}$O$_{\beta}$)$_3$X (X= Cl, F, Br, I) is carried out through first principles density functional theory simulations. The band gap and properties evolution from fluorine to iodine on fixed O/S ratios, as well as by substituting sulfur (S) for oxygen (O) are discussed. The reduction of the band gap by raising valence band energy levels, with an increasing S/O ratio can also be further modulated by the type of halide in the channels of the structure, thus promoting fine tuning of the band gap region. Defect states also play a crucial role in band gap modulation. Furthermore, the examination of the band edges properties in Ba$_5$(VS$_{\alpha}$O$_{\beta}$)$_3$X compounds suggests they can be potential photocatalysts candidates for the water splitting reaction, with reduced band gaps enabling efficient light-driven reactions, particularly in Ba$_5$(VS$_{\alpha}$O$_{\beta}$)$_3$I. Optical investigations reveal that sulfur doping induces optical anisotropy, enhancing light absorption and offering tailored optical behaviour. These results provide new insights for the design of functional materials in the broad family of apatites.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale symmetry protection of the reciprocal acoustoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neumann's principle states that all physical properties of a material are bound by its symmetry. While bulk crystals follow well-defined point and space groups, phenomena at a substrate's surface could have less apparent symmetry origins. Here we experimentally explore both reciprocal and non-reciprocal types of acoustoelectric (AE) effects driven by surface acoustic waves (SAW). The non-reciprocal AE voltage is connected to the natural single-phase unidirectional transducer from device engineering. On the other hand, reciprocal AE effect exists in certain SAW configurations that are of different symmetry origins. Half of the configurations have a valid reciprocity-preserving symmetry element of either a mirror plane or an even-order rotational axis that is perpendicular to the substrate surface. The other half of the configurations do not possess reciprocity-preserving symmetry operations of the half-space but have the SAW propagation and the surface normal directions interchanged from the first scenario. Here, the reciprocity of SAW states is protected by the symmetric structure of the nanoscale strain tensor. The correspondence between two types of configurations has its origin imbedded in the SAW composition of both compression and shear waves along two orthogonal directions respectively.</description>

      <title>Interfacially ordered phase states enable high-strength ductile eutectic Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight, high-strength structural materials are component enablers in transportation and aerospace, improving carbon footprint and fuel efficiency. Aluminium (Al)-based eutectics have property combinations that qualify them for such applications. However, they are prone to catastrophic failure because of insufficient load transfer across the interfaces between the brittle eutectic phase and the ductile matrix. Here we present a general solution to this problem by engineering these interfaces at the atomic scale, equipping them with excellent load transfer capabilities, thus qualifying such composites for lightweight structural applications. We demonstrate the approach by adding Zr to an Al-Gd-based hypoeutectic alloy, promoting the formation of a coherent Interfacial-Ordered-Phase (IOP) around the brittle Al3Gd eutectic phase and nanosized core-shell ordered precipitates in the primary Al matrix. This enables a 400% increase in tensile plasticity while retaining a high tensile strength of 295 MPa at room temperature and 130 MPa at 250C. This exceptional increase in formability is attributed to the ability of the IOP layer to prevent dislocations from accumulating at the weak fibre/matrix interfaces, avoiding stress concentrations that would otherwise initiate fibre breakage and debonding. The core-shell precipitates in Al cause a large number of dislocation cross/multiple-slips on different {111} planes, forming ultra-fine (10 nm) dislocation networks that leverage substantial plastic strain accumulation. The approach shows how atomic interface design overcomes the ductility limitations of lightweight high-strength ductile eutectic alloys for structural applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of quasi-steady dark excitons and gap phase in a doped semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton plays an important role in optics and optics-related behaviors and leads to novel correlated phases like charge order, exciton insulator, and exciton-polariton condensation. Dark exciton shows distinct properties from bright one. However, it cannot be directly detected by conventional optic measurements. The electronic modulation effect of dark excitons in quasi-equilibrium distribution, critical for electronic devices in working status, is still elusive. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report creating, detecting, and controlling dark excitons in the quasi-equilibrium distribution in a doped semiconductor SnSe2. Surprisingly, we observe an excitonic gap phase, with a conduction band opening an anisotropic gap. Our results broaden the scope of dark excitons, extending their studies from the picosecond timescale in the ultrafast photoemission process to conditions occurring under quasi-equilibrium. We reveal the light-matter interaction in the engineering of electronic structures and provide a new way to realize the excitonic gap phase in semiconductors with large band gaps.</description>

      <title>Extending Nonlocal Kinetic Energy Density Functionals to Isolated Systems via a Density-Functional-Dependent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wang-Teter-like nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) in the framework of orbital-free density functional theory, while successful in some bulk systems, exhibits a critical Blanc-Cances instability [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 214106 (2005)] when applied to isolated systems, where the total energy becomes unbounded from below. We trace this instability to the use of an ill-defined average charge density, which causes the functional to simultaneously violate the scaling law and the positivity of the Pauli energy. By rigorously constructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these pathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By systematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the resulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an order-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF. In addition, the new KEDF preserves WT's superior accuracy in bulk metals, outperforming the semilocal functionals in both regimes.</description>

      <title>The viscoelastic rheology of transient diffusion creep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycrystalline materials have a viscoelastic rheology where the strains produced by stresses depend on the timescale of deformation. Energy can be stored elastically within grain interiors and dissipated by a variety of different mechanisms. One such dissipation mechanism is diffusionally-accommodated/-assisted grain boundary sliding, also known as transient diffusion creep. Here we detail a simple reference model of transient diffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes: a regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic behaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised extended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and as an Andrade model at high frequencies. The parametrisation has a specific relaxation strength, Andrade exponent and Andrade time. The Andrade exponent depends only on the angles at which grains meet at triple junctions, and can be related to the exponents of stress singularities that occur at triple junctions in purely elastic models without diffusion. A comparison with laboratory experiments shows that the simple models here provide a lower bound on the observed attenuation. However, there are also clearly additional dissipative processes occurring in laboratory experiments that are not described by these simple models.</description>

      <title>Abinit 2025: New Capabilities for the Predictive Modeling of Solids and Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abinit is a widely used scientific software package implementing density functional theory and many related functionalities for excited states and response properties. This paper presents the novel features and capabilities, both technical and scientific, which have been implemented over the past 5 years. This evolution occurred in the context of evolving hardware platforms, high-throughput calculation campaigns, and the growing use of machine learning to predict properties based on databases of first principles results. We present new methodologies for ground states with constrained charge, spin or temperature; for density functional perturbation theory extensions to flexoelectricity and polarons; and for excited states in many-body frameworks including GW, dynamical mean field theory, and coupled cluster. Technical advances have extended abinit high-performance execution to graphical processing units and intensive parallelism. Second principles methods build effective models on top of first principles results to scale up in length and time scales. Finally, workflows have been developed in different community frameworks to automate \abinit calculations and enable users to simulate hundreds or thousands of materials in controlled and reproducible conditions.</description>

      <title>Band Meandering due to Charged Impurity Effects and Carrier Transport in Ternary Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the impact of charged impurities on the electrical properties of the topological insulator $\left(\mathrm{Bi}_{0.3} \mathrm{Sb}_{0.7}\right)_2 \mathrm{Te}_3$ (BST) and its indium-doped counterpart, $\mathrm{In}_{0.14}\left(\mathrm{Bi}_{0.3} \mathrm{Sb}_{0.7}\right)_{1.86} \mathrm{Te}_3$ (IBST), using field-effect gating. For thin BST (30 nm), charged impurities, potentially from silicon dioxide substrate traps, contribute to band tail-type localization, with the impurity density ($ n_{\text{imp}} = 10^{11} \text{ cm}^{-2} $) suggesting an external influence, though quantitative confirmation is needed. In contrast, thick BST (60 nm) exhibits potential fluctuations driven by inherent impurities ($ n_{\text{imp}} = 2.23 \times 10^{14} \text{ cm}^{-2} $), forming electron-rich (n-type) and hole-rich (p-type) regions that cause band meandering near the chemical potential. Indium doping in thin IBST significantly increases the impurity density to $ 1.53 \times 10^{15} \text{ cm}^{-2} $, exacerbating these fluctuations and reducing mobility due to enhanced scattering. Gate-dependence analysis further revealed a temperature-driven transition from n-type to p-type characteristics at elevated temperatures (~170 K), attributed to thermal activation of holes in p-type regions. These findings highlight the critical role of impurity management in optimizing topological insulators for applications in spintronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Improving Transmon Qubit Performance with Fluorine-based Surface Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing materials and processing-induced decoherence is critical to the development of utility-scale quantum processors based on superconducting qubits. Here we report on the impact of two fluorine-based wet etches, which we use to treat the silicon surface underneath the Josephson junctions (JJs) of fixed-frequency transmon qubits made with aluminum base metallization. Using several materials analysis techniques, we demonstrate that these surface treatments can remove germanium residue introduced by our JJ fabrication with no other changes to the overall process flow. These surface treatments result in significantly improved energy relaxation times for the highest performing process, with median $T_1=334~\mu$s, corresponding to quality factor $Q=6.6\times10^6$. This result suggests that the metal-substrate interface directly underneath the JJs was a major contributor to microwave loss in these transmon qubit circuits prior to integration of these surface treatments. Furthermore, this work illustrates how materials analysis can be used in conjunction with quantum device performance metrics to improve performance in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Charge distribution and magnetism in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: a hybrid functional study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate understanding of the ground state electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a high-temperature superconductor under pressure, is key for unveiling the origin of its superconductivity. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.</description>

      <title>Tunable chiral and nematic states in the triple-Q antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex spin configurations in magnetic materials, ranging from collinear single-Q to noncoplanar multi-Q states, exhibit rich symmetry and chiral properties. However, their detailed characterization is often hindered by the limited spatial resolution of neutron diffraction techniques. Here we employ magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magnetic linear dichroism (MLD) to investigate the triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, revealing three-state (Z3) nematicity and also spin chirality across its multi-Q magnetic phases. At intermediate temperatures, the presence of MLD identifies nematicity arising from a single-Q stripe phase, while at high magnetic fields and low temperatures, a phase characterized solely by MCD emerges, signifying a purely chiral non-coplanar triple-Q state. Notably, at low temperatures and small fields, we discover a unique phase where both chirality and nematicity coexist. A theoretical analysis based on a continuous multi-Q manifold captures the emergence of these distinct magnetic phases, as a result of the interplay between four-spin interactions and weak magnetic anisotropy. Additionally, MCD and MLD microscopy spatially resolves the chiral and nematic domains. Our findings establish Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ as a rare platform hosting diverse multi-Q states with distinct combinations of spin chirality and nematicity while demonstrating the effectiveness of polarized optical techniques in characterizing complex magnetic textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-2D tin iodide perovskites (TIPs) are promising lead-free alternatives for optoelectronic applications, but achieving stable lasing remains challenging due to their limited environmental stability. Here, we report air-stable, room-temperature lasing from quasi-2D TIP microcrystals as small as 4 {\mu}m. Incorporation of the organic spacer 5IPA3 significantly enhanced the stability of these materials compared to previously reported TIPs. Lasing was observed from both dielectric (n=4) and plasmonic (n=3 and n=4) TIP microlasers. Under picosecond pumping, lasing was sustained for over 10^8 pump pulses in ambient conditions. These results represent a significant step toward practical photonic applications of tin-based perovskites.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic theory of square skyrmion lattice in tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature part of the phase diagram of tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets is discussed within the framework of the mean-field approach. Based on recent experimental and theoretical studies, we consider a model including frustrated Heisenberg exchange, biquadratic exchange, anisotropic exchange, and magnetodipolar interaction. It is analytically demonstrated that a subtle interplay among these interactions results in a variety of phase diagrams in the temperature-magnetic field plane. We argue that the phase diagram obtained for the easy axis along the high-symmetry direction $[001]$ and moderate biquadratic exchange reproduces all crucial features of the phase diagram experimentally observed for~\gdru~compound. The topological properties of the respective double-modulated square skyrmion lattice phase are discussed. The developed analytical approach can also be useful for the refinement of the microscopic model parameters when comparing its predictions with experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Emergent Softening and Stiffening Dictate Transport of Active Filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filaments are crucial in various biophysical processes, yet insights into their single-filament behavior have predominantly relied on theory and simulations, owing to the scarcity of controllable synthetic systems. Here, we present an experimental platform of active semiflexible filaments composed of dielectric colloidal particles, activated by an alternating electric field that induces contractile or extensile electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flows. Our experiments reveal that contractile flow generating filaments undergo softening, significantly expanding the range of accessible conformations, whereas filaments composed of extensile flow monomers exhibit active stiffening. By independently tuning filament elasticity and activity, we demonstrate that the competition between elastic restoring forces and emergent hydrodynamic interactions along the filament governs conformational dynamics. Crucially, we discover that the timescale of conformational dynamics directly governs transport behavior: enhanced fluctuations promote diffusion while stiffening facilitates directed propulsion of nonlinear filaments. Together, our direct visualization studies elucidate the links between inherent filament properties, microscopic activity, and emergent transport while establishing a versatile experimental platform of synthetic filamentous active matter.</description>

Abstract: Light scattering intensity distribution along the optical fiber length is analyzed, which was measured by optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) during and after fiber irradiation in a nuclear reactor. The OTDR traces prove to contain two components associated with either radiation-induced attenuation (RIA), or with Rayleigh scattering coefficient (RSC) variation. The RSC increase effect in the first stage of fast-neutron irradiation is argued to be similar to the anomalous scattering buildup near the critical point of the liquid-vapor transition known as critical opalescence. For his reason, the RSC increase due to fast-neutron irradiation can be named neutron-induced opalescence (NIO).</description>

      <title>Design of thermal hysteresis in nonstoichiometric alloys with giant magnetocaloric effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-stoichiometric Fe$_2$P-type (FeMnP$_{0.5}$Si$_{0.5}$)$_{1-x}$(FeV)$_{x}$ alloys ( $x=0, 0.01$, $0.02$, and $0.03$) have been investigated as potential candidates for magnetic refrigeration near room temperature. The magnetic ordering temperature decreases with increasing FeV concentration, $x$, which can be ascribed to decreased ferromagnetic coupling strength between the magnetic atoms. The strong magnetoelastic coupling in these alloys results in large values of the isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_M$); $15.7$ J/kgK, at $2$ T magnetic field for the $x = 0$ alloy. $\Delta S_M$ decreases with increasing $x$. Results from M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy reveal that the average hyperfine field (in the ferromagnetic state) and average center shift (in the paramagnetic state) have the same decreasing trend as $\Delta S_M$. The thermal hysteresis ($\Delta T_{hyst}$) of the magnetic phase transition decreases with increasing $x$, while the mechanical stability of the alloys improves due to the reduced lattice volume change across the magnetoelastic phase transition. The adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}$, which highly depends on $\Delta T_{hyst}$, is $1.7$ K at $1.9$ T applied field for the $x = 0.02$ alloy.</description>

      <title>Direction-Dependent Conduction Polarity in Altermagnetic CrSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CrSb has recently gained immense attention as an altermagnetic candidate. This work reports on the experimental observation of direction-dependent conduction polarity (DDCP) in altermagnetic CrSb through Hall and Seebeck thermopower measurements. Conduction is dominated by holes along the c-axis and by electrons in the ab-plane of the hexagonal crystal of CrSb. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that DDCP in CrSb arises from a multicarrier mechanism, where electrons and holes living in distinct bands dominate conduction along different crystallographic directions. Furthermore, DFT predicts that DDCP exists within a narrow energy window near the Fermi level and is sensitive to small doping levels. This prediction is experimentally validated by the loss of DDCP in hole-doped Cr$_{0.98}$V$_{0.02}$Sb. These findings highlight the potential for tunable electronic behavior in CrSb, offering promising avenues for applications in devices that require both p-type and n-type functionalities within a single material.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic boron nitride-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. The rules predict the electric response properties more accurately than the magnetizabilities. The electric response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method for the estimation of uncertainties in density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for atomistic systems. The method is based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution (UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals and is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation functionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to experiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed self-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme furthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and a reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties: molecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the prediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of magnetism and topological properties in one material platform is attracting significant attention due to the potential of realizing low power consumption and error-robust electronic devices. Common practice is to start from a topological material with band inversion and incorporates ferromagnetism via chemical doping or magnetic proximity effect (MPE). In this work, we show that a topological material is not necessary and that both ferromagnetism and band inversion can be established simultaneously in a trivial insulating material by MPE from a neighbouring ferromagnetic layer. This novel route is demonstrated using quantum transport measurements and first principles calculations in a heterostructure consisting of 5 nm thick FeOx/1 monolayer of FeAs/ 3 nm thick alpha Sn. The Shubnikov de Haas oscillations show that there is linear band dispersion with high mobility in the heterostructure even though a 3 nm thick alpha Sn single layer is a trivial semiconductor. Furthermore, first principles calculations reveal that band inversion indeed occurs in this heterostructure, suggesting that the observed linear band is a topological surface state within this inverted gap. This work significantly expands the foundation for realizing magnetic topological materials in a myriad of trivial narrow gap semiconductors.</description>

      <title>PtyRAD: A High-performance and Flexible Ptychographic Reconstruction Framework with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress on the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets, we propose a generic effective spin model that describes interacting non-Kramers local moments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. We point out that the local moments consist of both magnetic dipole and quadrupole components and the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model with an intrinsic field that accounts for the crystal field splitting. We then study the ground-state phase diagram of the model and find that pure quadrupole orders, which are invisible to conventional experimental probes, can be stabilized over a broad regime. In particular, we show that a hidden ``1/3 magnetization plateau'' with quadrupole orders generally exists and discuss its experimental signatures. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets Pr$_{2}$Ga$_{2}$BeO$_{7}$ and Pr$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Convergence and Properties of Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids using plane waves as the underlying basis. The Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, polar covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), Steepest Ascent (SA) as well as the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. We hereby complement the quantum chemistry and materials science literature with an introduction to this topic along with key references. The solvers have been implemented both within the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) and as a standalone open-source software package. Furthermore, we observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic moir\'e band flattening in twisted bilayers of M-valley MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental studies on moir\'e materials have predominantly focused on twisted hexagonal lattice with low-energy states near the $\Gamma$- or K-points, where the electronic dispersion is typically isotropic. In contrast, we introduce a class of semiconducting transition metal carbides (MXenes) $M_2$C$T_2$ ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Sc, Y; $T$ = O, F, Cl) as a new platform for M-valley moir\'e materials, which exhibit pronounced anisotropic properties. Using Ti$_2$CO$_2$ and Zr$_2$CO$_2$ as representative examples, we perform large-scale \emph{ab initio} calculations and demonstrate that their AB-stacked twisted homobilayer hosts three threefold rotational-symmetry-related M-valleys with time-reversal symmetry. These systems show striking anisotropic band flattening in the conduction band minimum. To elucidate the underlying physics, we construct a simplified moir\'e Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of the band structure, revealing the origins of anisotropic flattening through the mechanisms of band folding and interlayer tunneling. Our findings expand the current landscape of moir\'e materials, establishing valley- and spin-degenerate, two-dimensional arrays of quasi-one-dimensional systems as promising platforms for exploring many interesting correlated electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Open Materials Generation with Stochastic Interpolants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new materials is essential for enabling technological advancements. Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMatG), a unifying framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline materials. OMatG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We benchmark OMatG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMatG, we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMatG establishes a new state of the art in generative modeling for materials discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations. These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science. The OMatG code is available at https://github.com/FERMat-ML/OMatG.</description>

      <title>Cusplike feature in Hall resistivity of a uniaxial ferromagnet in nonorthogonal Hall geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a cusplike feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away from the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This feature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a non-coplanar spin structure. In this article, we have studied the uniaxial ferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a consequence of the nonorthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is expected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy axis of magnetization, nonorthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity, exhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the magnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation of the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on the evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a nonorthogonal external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of particulate composites derived from ultradense stealthy hyperuniform sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.</description>

      <title>Quasi-bound layer-breathing phonons inside perfect dislocations of lattice-relaxed twisted bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer-breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moir\'e superlattices. The dislocations, forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers, bring about spatial modulation of the interlayer distance, generating effective potentials that promote the emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer-breathing modes inside perfect dislocations. For parallel MX$_2$ bilayers, perfect dislocations host multiple quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains. In contrast, antiparallel bilayers exhibit only a single quasi-bound band arising for orientations close to the edge-dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.</description>

      <title>Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these unique quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, a characteristic of the SESRE-enabled delicate balance between the confinement pontential volume, depth, the resulting exciton binding energy, and the degree of confinement of the center of mass (CM) motion of the exciton. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies reveal the structural (atomic scale) and chemical (nm scale) nature of the material region defining the notion of the shape and volume (here large) of the electron confinement region (i.e. the QD). In the exciton's weake CM confinement regime, owing to its coherent sampling of the large volume, enhancement of the MTSQD oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated. Theoretical modelling with input from the STEM finding provide corroboration for single photon superradiance causing enhancement of the oscillator strength by ~2.5 to 3. Our findings allow fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by the unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units that can be realized for lattice matched and mismatched material combinations covering UV to midinfrared wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Resilient cluster Mott states in layered Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ against pressure-induced symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.</description>
