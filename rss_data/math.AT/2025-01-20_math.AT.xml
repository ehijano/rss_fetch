      <title>Graph colouring and Steenrod's problem for Stanley-Reisner rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a classical problem in algebraic topology asked by Steenrod which graded rings occur as the cohomology ring of a space.
  In this paper, we define an algebraic version of the graph colouring, span colouring, and observe the relation between span colourings and Steenrod's problem for graded Stanley-Reisner rings, in other words polynomial rings divided by an ideal generated by square-free monic monomials.</description>

      <title>A $p$-adic de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second in a sequence of three articles exploring the relationship between commutative algebras and $E_\infty$-algebras in characteristic $p$ and mixed characteristic. Given a topological space $X,$ we construct, in a manner analogous to Sullivan's $A_{PL}$-functor, a strictly commutative algebra over $\padic$ which we call the de Rham forms on $X$. We show this complex computes the singular cohomology ring of $X$. We prove that it is quasi-isomorphic as an $E_\infty$-algebra to the Berthelot-Ogus-Deligne \emph{d\'ecalage} of the singular cochains complex with respect to the $p$-adic filtration. We show that one can extract concrete invariants from our model, including Massey products which live in the torsion part of the cohomology. We show that if $X$ is formal then, except at possibly finitely many primes, the $p$-adic de Rham forms on $X$ are also formal. We conclude by showing that the $p$-adic de Rham forms provide, in a certain sense, the "best functorial strictly commutative approximation" to the singular cochains complex.</description>

      <title>Model Categories and the Higher Riemann-Hilbert Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new model structure on the category of dg presheaves over a topological space $X$, obtained through the right Bousfield localization of the local projective model structure. The motivation for this construction arises from the study of the homotopy theory underlying higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence theorems, as developed by Chuang, Holstein, and Lazarev.
  Let $X$ be a smooth manifold. We prove the existence of a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between the category of dg modules over the de Rham algebra and the category of dg presheaves of vector spaces over $X$. In the case where $X$ is a complex manifold, we obtain an analogous result, where the de Rham algebra is replaced by the Dolbeault algebra. In both settings, we equip the categories of modules with model structures of the second kind, whose homotopy categories are, in general, finer invariants than those given by quasi-isomorphisms.
  Finally, we introduce a singular analogue of this equivalence, stating it as a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between the category of dg contramodules over the singular cochain algebra $C^{*}(X)$ and dg presheaves. At the level of homotopy categories, this establishes an equivalence between the contraderived category of $C^{*}(X)$-contramodules and the homotopy category of dg presheaves.</description>

      <title>Higher local systems, $n$-affineness and Koszul duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories on spaces. We prove that categorical local systems are captured by (higher) monodromy data. We show that if $X$ is $(n+1)$-connected, local systems of $(\infty,n)$-categories over $X$ can be described as $\mathbb{E}_{n}$-modules over the iterated loop space $\Omega^{n+1}_*X$. Our main result is a general statement of $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality for pairs of $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras of the form $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega^{n}_*X;\Bbbk) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$ when $X$ satisfies suitable connectedness and finiteness assumptions. This takes the shape of an equivalence of $(\infty,n)$-categories $n\mathbf{ShvCat}^{n-1}(\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))) \simeq n\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\Bbbk)$, where $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of the algebra of singular cochains, and $n\mathbf{ShvCat}^{n-1}$ is the $(\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\infty,n-1)$-categories. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures).</description>

      <title>Foundations of Differential Calculus for modules over posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field and let $C$ be a small category. A $k$-linear representation of $C$, or a $kC$-module, is a functor from $C$ to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over $k$. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that when the category $C$ is more general than a linear order, then its representation type is generally infinite and in most cases wild. Hence the task of understanding such representations in terms of their indecomposable factors becomes difficult at best, and impossible in general. This paper offers a new set of ideas designed to enable studying modules locally. Specifically, inspired by work in discrete calculus on graphs, we set the foundations for a calculus type analysis of $kC$-modules, under some restrictions on the category $C$. As a starting point, for a $kC$-module $M$ we define its gradient \emph{gradient} $\nabla[M]$ as a virtual module in the appropriate Grothendieck group. Pushing the analogy with ordinary differential calculus and discrete calculus on graphs, we define left and right divergence via the appropriate left and right Kan extensions and two bilinear pairings on modules and study their properties, specifically with respect to adjointness relations between the gradient and the left and right divergence. The left and right divergence are shown to be rather easily computable in favourable cases. Having set the scene, we concentrate specifically on the case where the category $C$ is a finite poset. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition for the gradient of a module $M$ to vanish under certain hypotheses on the poset. We next investigate implications for two modules whose gradients are equal. Finally we consider the resulting left and right Laplacians, namely the compositions of the divergence with the gradient, and study an example of the relationship between the vanishing of the Laplacians and the gradient.</description>

      <title>Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks; constructible factorization algebras are algebras for the $\infty$-operad of embedded disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>

      <title>On the Gottlieb group, Drinfeld centre and the centre of a crossed module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00981v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This new version includes a connection of the main construction to the Gottlieb group, which was absent in the previous versions. However, the first version included material about Lie algebras which will become available soon as a separate paper.
  The aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of the centre of a crossed module $\G_* = (\G_1\to \G_0)$. This centre is closely related to the Gottlieb group of the classifying space of a crossed module and also to the Drinfeld centre of a monoidal category introduced independently by Drinfeld and Joyal and Street. Our definition of the centre is based on certain crossed homomorphisms $\G_0\to \G_1$, which makes it easy to relate it to group cohomology. This connection is used to relate the Gottlieb group of a 2-type to its Whitehead centre.</description>

      <title>A proof of Dunfield-Gukov-Rasmussen Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2005 Dunfield, Gukov and Rasmussen conjectured an existence of the spectral sequence from the reduced triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology of a knot to its knot Floer homology defined by Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o. The main result of this paper is a proof of this conjecture. For this purpose, we construct a bigraded spectral sequence from the $\mathfrak{gl}_0$ homology constructed by the last two authors to the knot Floer homology. Using the fact that the $\mathfrak{gl}_0$ homology comes equipped with a spectral sequence from the reduced triply graded homology, we obtain our main result. The first spectral sequence is of Bockstein type and comes from a subtle manipulation of coefficients. The main tools are quantum traces of foams and of singular Soergel bimodules and a $\mathbb Z$-valued cube of resolutions model for knot Floer homology originally constructed by Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o over the field of two elements. As an application, we deduce that the $\mathfrak{gl}_0$ homology as well as the reduced triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky one detect the unknot, the two trefoils, the figure eight knot and the cinquefoil.</description>

      <title>A note on an application of discrete Morse theoretic techniques on the complex of disconnected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robin Forman's highly influential 2002 paper A User's Guide to Discrete Morse Theory presents an overview of the subject in a very readable manner. As a proof of concept, the author determines the topology (homotopy type) of the abstract simplicial complex of disconnected graphs of order $n$ (which was previously done by Victor Vassiliev using classical topological methods) using discrete Morse theoretic techniques, which are purely combinatorial in nature. The techniques involve the construction (and verification) of a discrete gradient vector field on the complex. However, the verification part relies on a claim that doesn't seem to hold. In this note, we provide a couple of counterexamples against this specific claim. We also provide an alternative proof of the bigger claim that the constructed discrete vector field is indeed a gradient vector field. Our proof technique relies on a key observation which is not specific to the problem at hand, and thus is applicable while verifying a constructed discrete vector field is a gradient one in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define spherical complexes as simplicial complexes with the property that every subcomplex obtained by a sequence of links and deletions either has trivial homology, or has the homology of a sphere. Examples of such complexes are independence complexes of ternary graphs and independence complexes of simplicial forests. We give criteria for when a spherical complex is acyclic, and describe the dimension of the sphere when it is not. We then apply our results to compute the Leray number of these complexes, and define combinatorial invariants for them which are counterparts to algebraic invariants of their Stanley-Reisner rings.</description>

Abstract: To any conic closed set of a cotangent bundle, one can associate four functors on the category of sheaves, which are called non-linear microlocal cut-off functors. Here we explain their relation with the microlocal cut-off functor defined by Kashiwara and Schapira, and prove a microlocal cut-off lemma for non-linear microlocal cut-off functors, adapting inputs from symplectic geometry. We also prove two K\"unneth formulas and a functor classification result for categories of sheaves with microsupport conditions.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: towards homology theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this expository paper we present some ideas of algebraic topology (more precisely, of homology theory) in a language accessible to non-specialists in the area. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. We start from the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all $1$-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of $1$-cycles in a given graph such that any $1$-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs, and to certain configuration spaces of graphs (namely, to the square and the deleted square).</description>
