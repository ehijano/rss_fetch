      <title>Two billiard domains whose billiard maps are Lazutkin conjugates are the same</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that two billiards whose billiard maps share the same expression in Lazutkin coordinates are isometric. Moreover, two conjugate billiard maps must be conjugated via a diffeomorphism that is tangent to a Lazutkin-type change of coordinates up to order 1.</description>

      <title>Variational Collision Integrators for Nonholonomic Lagrangian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete theory for implicit nonholonomic Lagrangian systems undergoing elastic collisions is developed. It is based on the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert-Pontryagin variational principle and the dynamical equations thus obtained are the discrete nonholonomic implicit Euler-Lagrange equations together with the discrete conditions for the elastic impact. To illustrate the theory, variational integrators with collisions are built for several examples, including a bouncing ellipse and a nonholonomic spherical pendulum evolving inside a cylinder.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Synchronization Definitions in the Kuramoto Flow: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified dynamical framework that rigorously establishes the equivalence between various synchronization notions in generalized Kuramoto models. Our formulation encompasses both first- and second-order models with heterogeneous inertia, damping, natural frequencies, and general symmetric coupling coefficients, including attractive, repulsive, and mixed interactions. We demonstrate that, under minimal assumptions, full phase-locking, phase-locking, frequency synchronization, order parameter synchronization, and acceleration synchronization coincide. This resolves long-standing ambiguities in the nonlinear theory of synchronization and provides a systematic classification of asymptotic behaviors in finite-size oscillator networks. The framework further provides sharpened necessary conditions for synchronization across both first- and second-order classical Kuramoto flows, by establishing upper and lower bounds on the long-time behavior of the order parameter.
  Beyond its mathematical depth, our theory offers a broadly applicable framework that may inform future studies in nonlinear optics, quantum synchronization, and collective behavior in open systems. In particular, by rigorously linking microscopic dynamics to macroscopic observables such as the Kuramoto order parameter, it has the potential to clarify the dynamical mechanisms underlying coherence, dissipation, and emergent order in mesoscopic and many-body settings.</description>

      <title>The fibered rotation number for ergodic symplectic cocycles and its applications: I. Gap Labelling Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ (\Theta,T,\mu) $ be an ergodic topological dynamical system. The fibered rotation number for cocycles in $ \Theta\times \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) $, acting on $ \Theta\times \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1
  $ is well-defined and has wide applications in the study of the spectral theory of Schr\"odinger operators. In this paper, we will provide its natural generalization for higher dimensional cocycles in $ \Theta\times\mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ or $ \Theta\times \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $, where $ \mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ and $ \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $ respectively refer to the $ 2m $-dimensional symplectic or Hermitian-symplectic matrices. As a corollary, we establish the equivalence between the integrated density of states for generalized Schr\"odinger operators and the fibered rotation number; and the Gap Labelling Theorem via the Schwartzman group, as expected from the one dimensional case [AS1983, JM1982].</description>

      <title>Information geometry of chemical reaction networks: Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information geometry is based on classical Legendre duality but allows to incorporate additional structure such as algebraic constraints and Bregman divergence functions. It is naturally suited, and has been successfully used, to describe the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) based on the Legendre duality between concentration and potential spaces, where algebraic constraints are enforced by the stoichiometry. In this article, the Riemannian geometrical aspects of the theory are explored. It is shown that duality between concentration and potential spaces and the natural parametrizations of equilibrium subspace are isometries, which leads to a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound through the comparison of two Riemannian metric tensors.
  In the subsequent part, the theory is applied to the recently introduced concept of absolute sensitivity. Using the Riemannian geometric tools, it is proven that the absolute sensitivity is a projection operator onto the tangent bundle of the equilibrium manifold. A linear algebraic characterization and explicit results on first order corrections to the thermodynamics of ideal solutions are provided. Finally, the theory is applied to the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system.
  The novelty of the theory is that it is applicable to CRNs with non-ideal thermodynamical behavior, which are prevalent in highly crowded cellular environments due to various interactions between the chemicals. Indeed, the analyzed example shows remarkable behavior ranging from hypersensitivity to negative-self regulations. These are effects which usually require strongly nonlinear reaction kinetics. However, here, they are obtained by tuning thermodynamical interactions providing a complementary, and physically well-founded, viewpoint on such phenomena.</description>

      <title>Fronts in dissipative Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a dissipative Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain particles interact with their nearest neighbors through anharmonic potentials and linear dissipative forces. We prove the existence of front solutions connecting two different uniformly compressed (or stretched) states at $\pm \infty$ using an implicit function argument starting at a suitable continuum limit in the case of large damping. A detailed analysis allows us to show monotonicity of waves and to determine sharp exponential decay rates for a wide class of potentials including Hertzian potentials.</description>

      <title>Smooth invariant foliations and Koopman eigenfunctions about stable equilibria of semiflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a $C^r$ semiflow $\{ \varphi_t \}_{t \geq 0}$ on a Banach space $X$ admitting a stable fixed point $x$. We show, along the lines of the parameterization method (Cabr\'e et al., 2003), the existence of a $C^r$ invariant foliation tangent to $X_1$ at $x$, for an arbitrary $D \varphi_t(x)$-invariant subspace $X_1 \subset X$ satisfying some additional spectral conditions. Uniqueness ensues in a subclass of sufficiently smooth invariant foliations tangent to $X_1$ at $x$. We then draw relations to Koopman theory, and thereby establish the existence and uniqueness, in some appropriate sense, of $C^r$ Koopman eigenfunctions. We demonstrate that these results apply to the case of the Navier-Stokes system, the archetypal example considered by the modern upheaval of applied 'Koopmanism'.</description>

      <title>On the valence of logharmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating a problem posed by W. Hengartner (2000), we study the maximal valence (number of preimages of a prescribed point in the complex plane) of logharmonic polynomials, i.e., complex functions that take the form $f(z) = p(z) \overline{q(z)}$ of a product of an analytic polynomial $p(z)$ of degree $n$ and the complex conjugate of another analytic polynomial $q(z)$ of degree $m$. In the case $m=1$, we adapt an indirect technique utilizing anti-holomorphic dynamics to show that the valence is at most $3n-1$. This confirms a conjecture of Bshouty and Hengartner (2000). Using a purely algebraic method based on Sylvester resultants, we also prove a general upper bound for the valence showing that for each $n,m \geq 1$ the valence is at most $n^2+m^2$. This improves, for every choice of $n,m \geq 1$, the previously established upper bound $(n+m)^2$ based on Bezout's theorem. We also consider the more general setting of polyanalytic polynomials where we show that this latter result can be extended under a nondegeneracy assumption.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Markov Chains for Constant Step-size Stochastic Gradient Descent with Separable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for minimizing objective functions that arise in machine learning. For constant step-sized SGD, the iterates form a Markov chain on a general state space. Focusing on a class of separable (non-convex) objective functions, we establish a "Doeblin-type decomposition," in that the state space decomposes into a uniformly transient set and a disjoint union of absorbing sets. Each of the absorbing sets contains a unique invariant measure, with the set of all invariant measures being the convex hull. Moreover the set of invariant measures are shown to be global attractors to the Markov chain with a geometric convergence rate. The theory is highlighted with examples that show: (1) the failure of the diffusion approximation to characterize the long-time dynamics of SGD; (2) the global minimum of an objective function may lie outside the support of the invariant measures (i.e., even if initialized at the global minimum, SGD iterates will leave); and (3) bifurcations may enable the SGD iterates to transition between two local minima. Key ingredients in the theory involve viewing the SGD dynamics as a monotone iterated function system and establishing a "splitting condition" of Dubins and Freedman 1966 and Bhattacharya and Lee 1988.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Consistent Coarse Graining using Kernel-based Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how kernel-based models for the Koopman generator -- the gEDMD method -- can be used to identify coarse-grained dynamics on reduced variables, which retain the slowest transition timescales of the original dynamics. The centerpiece of this study is a learning method to identify an effective diffusion in coarse-grained space, which is similar in spirit to the force matching method. By leveraging the gEDMD model for the Koopman generator, the kinetic accuracy of the CG model can be evaluated. By combining this method with a suitable learning method for the effective free energy, such as force matching, a complete model for the effective dynamics can be inferred. Using a two-dimensional model system and molecular dynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide and the Chignolin mini-protein, we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully and robustly recovers the essential kinetic and also thermodynamic properties of the full model. The parameters of the method can be determined using standard model validation techniques.</description>
