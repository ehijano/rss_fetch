      <title>Adversarial Social Influence: Modeling Persuasion in Contested Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Social Influence Game (SIG), a framework for modeling adversarial persuasion in social networks with an arbitrary number of competing players. Our goal is to provide a tractable and interpretable model of contested influence that scales to large systems while capturing the structural leverage points of networks. Each player allocates influence from a fixed budget to steer opinions that evolve under DeGroot dynamics, and we prove that the resulting optimization problem is a difference-of-convex program. To enable scalability, we develop an Iterated Linear (IL) solver that approximates player objectives with linear programs. In experiments on random and archetypical networks, IL achieves solutions within 7% of nonlinear solvers while being over 10x faster, scaling to large social networks. This paper lays a foundation for asymptotic analysis of contested influence in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19525v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In settings like vaccination registries, individuals act after observing others, and the resulting public records can expose private information. We study privacy-preserving sequential learning, where agents add endogenous noise to their reported actions to conceal private signals. Efficient social learning relies on information flow, seemingly in conflict with privacy. Surprisingly, with continuous signals and a fixed privacy budget $(\epsilon)$, the optimal randomization strategy balances privacy and accuracy, accelerating learning to $\Theta_{\epsilon}(\log n)$, faster than the nonprivate $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ rate. In the nonprivate baseline, the expected time to the first correct action and the number of incorrect actions diverge; under privacy with sufficiently small $\epsilon$, both are finite. Privacy helps because, under the false state, agents more often receive signals contradicting the majority; randomization then asymmetrically amplifies the log-likelihood ratio, enhancing aggregation. In heterogeneous populations, an order-optimal $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ rate is achievable when a subset of agents have low privacy budgets. With binary signals, however, privacy reduces informativeness and impairs learning relative to the nonprivate baseline, though the dependence on $\epsilon$ is nonmonotone. Our results show how privacy reshapes information dynamics and inform the design of platforms and policies.</description>

      <title>Framing Unionization on Facebook: Communication around Representation Elections in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital media have become central to how labor unions communicate, organize, and sustain collective action. Yet little is known about how unions' online discourse relates to concrete outcomes such as representation elections. This study addresses the gap by combining National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election data with 158k Facebook posts published by U.S. labor unions between 2015 and 2024. We focused on five discourse frames widely recognized in labor and social movement communication research: diagnostic (identifying problems), prognostic (proposing solutions), motivational (mobilizing action), community (emphasizing solidarity), and engagement (promoting interaction). Using a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, we systematically annotated unions' posts and analyzed patterns of frame usage around election events. Our findings showed that diagnostic and community frames dominated union communication overall, but that frame usage varied substantially across organizations. In election cases that unions won, communication leading up to the vote showed an increased use of diagnostic, prognostic, and community frames, followed by a reduction in prognostic and motivational framing after the event--patterns consistent with strategic preparation. By contrast, in lost election cases unions showed little adjustment in their communication, suggesting an absence of tailored communication strategies. By examining variation in message-level framing, the study highlights how communication strategies adapt to organizational contexts, contributing open tools and data and complementing prior research in understanding digital communication of unions and social movements.</description>

      <title>Paper Quality Assessment based on Individual Wisdom Metrics from Open Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional closed peer review systems, which have played a central role in scientific publishing, are often slow, costly, non-transparent, stochastic, and possibly subject to biases - factors that can impede scientific progress and undermine public trust. Here, we propose and examine the efficacy and accuracy of an alternative form of scientific peer review: through an open, bottom-up process. First, using data from two major scientific conferences (CCN2023 and ICLR2023), we highlight how high variability of review scores and low correlation across reviewers presents a challenge for collective review. We quantify reviewer agreement with community consensus scores and use this as a reviewer quality estimator, showing that surprisingly, reviewer quality scores are not correlated with authorship quality. Instead, we reveal an inverted U-shape relationship, where authors with intermediate paper scores are the best reviewers. We assess empirical Bayesian methods to estimate paper quality based on different assessments of individual reviewer reliability. We show how under a one-shot review-then-score scenario, both in our models and on real peer review data, a Bayesian measure significantly improves paper quality assessments relative to simple averaging. We then consider an ongoing model of publishing, reviewing, and scoring, with reviewers scoring not only papers but also other reviewers. We show that user-generated reviewer ratings can yield robust and high-quality paper scoring even when unreliable (but unbiased) reviewers dominate. Finally, we outline incentive structures to recognize high-quality reviewers and encourage broader reviewing coverage of submitted papers. These findings suggest that a self-selecting open peer review process is potentially scalable, reliable, and equitable with the possibility of enhancing the speed, fairness, and transparency of the peer review process.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems.</description>

      <title>GARG-AML against Smurfing: A Scalable and Interpretable Graph-Based Framework for Anti-Money Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: This paper introduces a novel graph-based method, GARG-AML, for efficient and effective anti-money laundering (AML). It quantifies smurfing risk, a popular money laundering method, by providing each node in the network with a single interpretable score. The proposed method strikes a balance among computational efficiency, detection power and transparency. Different versions of GARG-AML are introduced for undirected and directed networks.
  Methodology: GARG-AML constructs the adjacency matrix of a node's second-order neighbourhood in a specific way. This allows us to use the density of different blocks in the adjacency matrix to express the neighbourhood's resemblance to a pure smurfing pattern. GARG-AML is extended using a decision tree and gradient-boosting classifier to increase its performance even more. The methods are tested on synthetic and on open-source data against the current state-of-the-art in AML.
  Findings: We find that GARG-AML obtains state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. We illustrate that GARG-AML scales well to massive transactions graphs encountered at financial institutions. By leveraging only the adjacency matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing fraud detection.
  Originality: This paper uses only basic network features and expert knowledge on smurfing to construct a performant AML system. The originality lies in the translation of smurfing detection to these features and network representation. Our proposed method is built around the real business needs of scalability and interpretability. It therefore provides a solution that can be easily implemented at financial institutions or incorporated in existing AML solutions.</description>

      <title>CrediBench: Building Web-Scale Network Datasets for Information Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online misinformation poses an escalating threat, amplified by the Internet's open nature and increasingly capable LLMs that generate persuasive yet deceptive content. Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and the dataset is in this folder.</description>

      <title>FTSCommDetector: Discovering Behavioral Communities through Temporal Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.</description>

      <title>Handling Heterophily in Recommender Systems with Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalised user experiences across various domains. However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</description>
