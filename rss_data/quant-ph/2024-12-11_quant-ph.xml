      <title>The construction of quantum mechanics from electromagnetism. Part I: the unitary entity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct Quantum Mechanics in a way that harmonises with Classical Mechanics and Electromagnetism, free from mysteries or paradoxes as the \emph{collapse of the wave-function} or \emph{Schr\"odinger's cat.} The construction is inspired by de Broglie and Schr\"odinger's wave mechanics while the unifying principle is Hamilton's principle of least action, which separates natural laws from particular circumstances such as initial conditions and leads to the conservation of energy for isolated systems. We also provide a criticism of instrumentalism, the leading philosophical perspective behind conventional Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <title>The construction of quantum mechanics from electromagnetism. Part II: the Hydrogen atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part I we constructed the Quantum Mechanics of a charged unitary entity and prescribed the form in which such a particle interacts with other charged particles and matter in general. In this second part we extend the description to the hydrogen atom testing the correctness and accuracy of the general description. The relation between electron and proton in the atom is described systematically in a construction that is free from analogies or ad-hoc derivations and it supersedes conventional Quantum Mechanics (whose equations linked to measurements can be recovered). We briefly discuss why the concept of isolation built in Schr\"odinger's time evolution is not acceptable and how it immediately results in the well known measurement paradoxes of quantum mechanics. We also discuss the epistemic grounds of the development as well as those of conventional Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The working environment in healthcare analytics is transforming with the emergence of healthcare 5.0 and the advancements in quantum neural networks. In addition to analyzing a comprehensive set of case studies, we also review relevant literature from the fields of quantum computing applications and smart healthcare analytics, focusing on the implications of quantum deep neural networks.

      <title>Reciprocal lumped-element superconducting circuits: quantization, decomposition, and model extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce new methods for the quantization, decomposition, and extraction (from electromagnetic simulations) of lumped-element circuit models for superconducting quantum devices. Our flux-charge symmetric procedures center on the network matrix, which encodes the connectivity of a circuit's inductive loops and capacitive nodes. First, we use the network matrix to demonstrate a simple algorithm for circuit quantization, giving novel predictions for the Hamiltonians of circuits with both Josephson junctions and quantum phase slip wires. We then show that by performing pivoting operations on the network matrix, we can decompose a superconducting circuit model into its simplest equivalent "fundamental" form, in which the harmonic degrees of freedom are separated out from the Josephson junctions and phase slip wires. Finally, we illustrate how to extract an exact, transformerless circuit model from electromagnetic simulations of a device's hybrid admittance/impedance response matrix, by matching the lumped circuit's network matrix to the network topology of the physical layout. Overall, we provide a toolkit of intuitive methods that can be used to construct, analyze, and manipulate superconducting circuit models.</description>

      <title>Robust Catalysis and Resource Broadcasting: The Possible and the Impossible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In resource theories, catalysis refers to the possibility of enabling otherwise inaccessible quantum state transitions by providing the agent with an auxiliary system, under the condition that this auxiliary is returned to its initial state at the end of the protocol. Most studies to date have focused on fine-tuned catalytic processes that are highly sensitive to error: if the initial state of the system deviates even slightly from that for which the catalyst was designed, the catalyst would be irreparably degraded. To address this challenge, we introduce and study robust catalytic transformations and explore the extent of their capabilities. It turns out that robust catalysis is subtly related to the property of resource broadcasting. In particular, we show that the possibility of robust catalysis is equivalent to that of resource broadcasting in completely resource non-generating theories. This allows us to characterize a general class of resource theories that allow neither robust catalysis nor resource broadcasting, and another class where instead resource broadcasting and robust catalysis are possible and provide maximal advantage. Our approach encompasses a wide range of quantum resource theories, including entanglement, coherence, thermodynamics, magic, and imaginarity.</description>

      <title>A generic multi-Pauli compilation framework for limited connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and effective compilation of quantum circuits remains an important aspect of executing quantum programs. In this paper, we propose a generic compilation framework particularly suitable for limited connectivity, that extends many of the known techniques for Pauli network synthesis. Our compilation method, built on the introduced Clifford Executive Representation, stands out by considering the implementation of multiple Pauli operators at once, which are not necessarily commuting. The proposed technique also allows for effective Clifford circuit synthesis. We benchmark our methods against circuits resulting from the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm and the results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimal work extraction from a quantum-dot information engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Optimising entanglement distribution policies under classical communication constraints assisted by reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters play a crucial role in the effective distribution of entanglement over long distances. The nearest-future type of quantum repeater requires two operations: entanglement generation across neighbouring repeaters and entanglement swapping to promote short-range entanglement to long-range. For many hardware setups, these actions are probabilistic, leading to longer distribution times and incurred errors. Significant efforts have been vested in finding the optimal entanglement-distribution policy, i.e. the protocol specifying when a network node needs to generate or swap entanglement, such that the expected time to distribute long-distance entanglement is minimal. This problem is even more intricate in more realistic scenarios, especially when classical communication delays are taken into account. In this work, we formulate our problem as a Markov decision problem and use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimise over centralised strategies, where one designated node instructs other nodes which actions to perform. Contrary to most RL models, ours can be readily interpreted. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate a fixed local policy, the `predictive swap-asap' policy, where nodes only coordinate with nearest neighbours. Compared to the straightforward generalization of the common swap-asap policy to the scenario with classical communication effects, the `wait-for-broadcast swap-asap' policy, both of the aforementioned entanglement-delivery policies are faster at high success probabilities. Our work showcases the merit of considering policies acting with incomplete information in the realistic case when classical communication effects are significant.</description>

      <title>Implementing a Quantum Finite Automaton in IBMQ using Custom Control Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum finite automata can be used for pattern recognition. Present implementations on actual quantum devices face decoherence issues, which compromise the quality of long strings computation. In this work, we focus on the Measure Once 1-way Quantum Finite Automata (MO1QFA) model for addressing the MOD^p problem, investigating how quantum errors may affect the quality of the computation in this model when implemented in IBM-Q superconducting environment. To improve the performance of the implementation, we use pulse-level programming for calibrating a fast single-qubit gate designed specifically for the automaton implementation. The demonstrations conducted on the Jakarta quantum computer show that using custom pulses significantly reduces errors during extended word computations. While realizing improvements in error variations and predictability -- with a fourfold reduction in circuit latency -- the proposed solution demonstrates a substantial increase in the supported computation length of the automaton. When considering thresholds of 10% and 20% in absolute errors of acceptance probabilities, the solution has the potential to increase the maximum word length by 12 and 7+ times, respectively, compared to the default Qiskit gate.</description>

      <title>Efficacious qubit mappings for quantum simulations of the $^{12}$C rotational band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving atomic nuclei from first principles places enormous demands on computational resources, which grow exponentially with increasing number of particles and the size of the space they occupy. We present first quantum simulations based on the variational quantum eigensolver for the low-lying structure of the $^{12}$C nucleus that provide acceptable bound-state energies even in the presence of noise. We achieve this by taking advantage of two critical developments. First, we utilize an almost perfect symmetry of atomic nuclei that, in a complete symmetry-adapted basis, drastically reduces the size of the model space. Second, we use the efficacious Gray encoding, for which it has been recently shown that it is resource efficient, especially when coupled with a near band-diagonal structure of the nuclear Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Assistance as a measure of multiparty entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying multipartite entanglement poses a significant challenge in quantum information theory, prompting recent advancements in methodologies to assess it. We introduce the notion of \enquote{Volume of Assistance} (VoA), which computes the geometric mean of entanglement of assistance across all potential parties. We demonstrate the feasibility of VoA for three-qubit pure states and certain classes of pure tripartite qudit states. We have extended this measure to four-qubit states and general multipartite scenarios. We have done a comparative analysis to illustrate VoA's distinctiveness from established entanglement measures, notably showing it serves as an upper bound for the much celebrated generalized geometric measure (GGM). Remarkably, VoA excels in distinguishing a broad class of states that elude differentiation by the recently proposed Minimum Pairwise Concurrence (MPC) measure. Finally, VoA is applied to quantify genuine entanglement in the ground states of a three-qubit Heisenberg XY model, which highlights its practical utility in quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploiting SU(N ) dynamical symmetry for rovibronic stabilization of a weakly bound diatomic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multilevel scheme to coherently transfer the population of a diatomic molecule from a rovibrational level to a target rovibrational level of the same electronic state or another. It involves a linear chain of N rovibrational levels alternating between the initial electronic state and a second electronic state, conveniently selected according to the dipole couplings between consecutive levels. A set of N - 1 simultaneous weak laser $\pi$ pulses, with simple analytical shapes, each in resonance between two neighbors of the chain, transfers the population from the initial rovibronic state gradually and consecutively through the chain, until at the end of the process it resides in the target rovibronic state, as in a kind of ping-pong game between the two electronic states. Using the partial-wave expansion of the molecular wave function, vibrational bases within the J manifolds of each electronic state, and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we map the radial Hamiltonian to the one of a spin s = (N - 1)/2 under a static magnetic field, providing an analytical formula for the populations of the linked states. As an illustration, we apply the scheme to the stabilization into the absolute ground state of a KRb molecule initially in the high-lying $\upsilon$ = 75, J = 6 level of the ground electronic state $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}$. With a chain of seven rovibronic states, three of them belonging to the excited $A^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic state, and pulses of 0.4 ns of duration, the population is fully transferred into the target state in about 1 ns.</description>

      <title>Random regular graph states are complex at almost any depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are fundamental objects in the theory of quantum information due to their simple classical description and rich entanglement structure. They are also intimately related to IQP circuits, which have applications in quantum pseudorandomness and quantum advantage. For us, they are a toy model to understand the relation between circuit connectivity, entanglement structure and computational complexity. In the worst case, a strict dichotomy in the computational universality of such graph states appears as a function of the degree $d$ of a regular graph state [GDH+23]. In this paper, we initiate the study of the average-case complexity of simulating random graph states of varying degree when measured in random product bases and give distinct evidence that a similar complexity-theoretic dichotomy exists in the average case. Specifically, we consider random $d$-regular graph states and prove three distinct results: First, we exhibit two families of IQP circuits of depth $d$ and show that they anticoncentrate for any $2 &lt; d = o(n)$ when measured in a random $X$-$Y$-plane product basis. This implies anticoncentration for random constant-regular graph states. Second, in the regime $d = \Theta(n^c)$ with $c \in (0,1)$, we prove that random $d$-regular graph states contain polynomially large grid graphs as induced subgraphs with high probability. This implies that they are universal resource states for measurement-based computation. Third, in the regime of high degree ($d\sim n/2$), we show that random graph states are not sufficiently entangled to be trivially classically simulable, unlike Haar random states. Proving the three results requires different techniques--the analysis of a classical statistical-mechanics model using Krawtchouck polynomials, graph theoretic analysis using the switching method, and analysis of the ranks of submatrices of random adjacency matrices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Charge state transition of spectrally stabilized tin-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters are an important platform for quantum information processing. The fabrication of the emitters with stable photon frequency and narrow linewidth is a fundamental issue, and it is essential to understand optical conditions under which the emitter keeps a bright charge state or transitions to a dark state. For these purposes, in this study, we investigate the spectral stability and charge state transition of tin-vacancy (SnV) centers in diamond. The photoluminescence excitation spectra of multiple SnV centers are basically stable over time with nearly transform-limited linewidths under resonant excitation, while simultaneous irradiation of resonant and non-resonant lasers makes spectra from the SnV centers unstable. We find that the instability occurs due to the charge state transition to a dark state. The charge state transition rates are quantitatively investigated depending on the laser powers. Lastly, with first-principle calculations, we model the charge state transition of the SnV center under the laser irradiation.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithm for Constrained Topology Optimization in Quantum Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum scientific computing has emerged as a new paradigm to solve difficult scientific computing problems on quantum computers. One of them is topology optimization, which is computationally expensive because the combinatorial optimization problem and partial differential equations need to be solved simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel variational quantum algorithm for topology optimization through quantum entanglement. Two quantum registers are used to encode the optimal configurations and the solutions to physical constraints, respectively. The tasks of finding the optimal material configuration and solving the physical constraints are performed simultaneously in a single loop. A constraint encoding scheme is also proposed to incorporate volume and topology constraints in optimization. The gate complexity of the proposed quantum algorithm is analyzed. The theoretical lower bound of the success probability is obtained. The algorithm is demonstrated with compliance minimization problems including truss structures and Messerschmitt-B\"olkow-Blohm beams.</description>

      <title>A Framework For Estimating Amplitudes of Quantum State With Single-Qubit Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a simple framework for estimating the amplitudes of a given $n$-qubit quantum state $\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} a_i \ket{i}$ in computational basis, utilizing a single-qubit measurement only. Previously, it was a common procedure that one could measure all qubits in order to collect measurement outcomes, from which one can estimate amplitudes of given quantum state. Here, we show that if restricting to single-qubit measurement, and one can perform measurement on arbitrary basis, then the measurement outcomes can be used to assist the finding of amplitudes in the usual computational, or Z basis. More concretely, such outcomes are capable of constructing a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, and by classically solving them, we obtain $\Tilde{a}_i$, which is the approximation to the corresponding amplitudes $a_i$, including both real and imaginary component. We then discuss our framework from a broader perspective. First, we show that estimating all (norms of) amplitudes to additive accuracy $\delta$, i.e., $| |\Tilde{a}_i - |a_i| | \leq \delta$ for all $i$, $\mathcal{O}(4^n/\delta^4)$ single-qubit measurements is sufficient. Second, we show that to achieve total variation $\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} | |\Tilde{a}_i|^2 - |a_i|^2| \leq \delta $, $\mathcal{O}(6^n/\delta^4)$ a single bit measurement is required. Finally, in order to achieve an average $L_1$ norm error $ \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} | |\Tilde{a}_i| - |a_i| |/2^n \leq \delta$, a single bit measurement $\mathcal{O}(2^n/ \delta^4)$ is needed.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulating Rydberg Atom Quantum Computers for Hardware-Software Co-design with PachinQo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to accelerate various domains: scientific computation, machine learning, and optimization. Recently, Rydberg atom quantum computing has emerged as a promising quantum computing technology, especially with the demonstration of the zonal addressing architecture. However, this demonstration is only compatible with one type of quantum algorithm, and extending it to compile and execute general quantum algorithms is a challenge. To address it, we propose PachinQo, a framework to co-design the architecture and compilation for zonal addressing systems for any given quantum algorithm. PachinQo's evaluation demonstrates its ability to improve a quantum algorithm's estimated probability of success by 45% on average in error-prone quantum environments.</description>

      <title>Fast mixed-species quantum logic gates for trapped-ion quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum logic operations between physically distinct qubits is an essential aspect of large-scale quantum information processing. We propose an approach to high-speed mixed-species entangling operations in trapped-ion quantum computers, based on mechanical excitation of spin-dependent ion motion by ultrafast pulsed lasers. We develop the theory and machine-design of pulse sequences that realise MHz-speed `fast gates' between a range of mixed-isotope and mixed-species ion pairings with experimentally-realistic laser controls. We demonstrate the robustness of the gate mechanism against expected experimental errors, and identify errors in ultrafast single-qubit control as the primary technical limitation. We demonstrate that the mixed-species fast gate mechanism enables the protection of ion-photon entanglement against rapid spin dephasing of matter-photon interfaces, paving the path for high-fidelity and high-speed quantum networking in trapped-ion architectures.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation-based quantum-selected configuration interaction for large-scale electronic structure calculations with a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is one of the most promising approaches for quantum chemical calculations with the current pre-fault tolerant quantum computers. In the conventional QSCI, the Slater determinants used for the wave function expansion are sampled by iteratively performing approximate wave function preparation and subsequent measurement in the computational basis, and then the subspace Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized on a classical computer. In this approach, the preparation of a high-quality approximate wave function is necessary to compute total energies accurately. In this work, we propose a Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) to avoid this difficulty. In the HSB-QSCI, the Slater determinants are sampled from quantum states generated by the real-time evolution of approximate wave functions. We provide numerical simulations for the spin-singlet ground state and the first excited spin-triplet state of oligoacenes (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene), phenylene-1,4-dinitrene, and hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene molecules; these results reveal that the HSB-QSCI is applicable not only to molecules where the Hartree--Fock provides a good approximation of the ground state, but also to strongly correlated systems with multiconfigurational characteristics (i.e., the case where preparing a high-quality approximate wave function is hard). We have also numerically confirmed that the HSB-QSCI is robust to approximation errors of the Hamiltonian simulation, such as Trotter errors and the truncation errors of Hamiltonian term by maximum locality in the localized molecular orbital basis. Hardware demonstrations of the HSB-QSCI are also reported for the hexa-1,2,3,4,5-pentaene molecule using 20 qubits IBM superconducting device. The differences between the HSB-QSCI energy and the CAS-CI value are at most 0.15 kcal mol$^{-1}$, achieving chemical precision.</description>

      <title>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost - a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. In stochastic thermodynamics, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation revealed a trade-off between the relative variance of a thermodynamic current and the entropy production. Although the thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that infinitely-large entropy production enables unbounded precision improvements, this is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the minimum eigenvalue factor, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Optimal unitary trajectories under commuting target and cost observables; applications to cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum states, especially cooling, is a fundamental technology for nanoscale devices. The past decade has seen important results related to both the limits of state transformation and the limits to their efficiency -- the quantum versions of the third and second law of thermodynamics. The limiting cases always involve an infinite resource cost, typically machine complexity or time. Realistic state preparation takes into account both a finite size of the machine and constraints on the operations we can perform. In this work, we determine in full generality the optimal operation for a predominant quantum paradigm: state transformation under a single unitary operation upon a finite system, in the case where the observables corresponding to the target (such as ground state probability) and cost (such as dissipation) commute. We then extend this result to the case of having a third, commuting, globally conserved quantity (such as total energy). The results are demonstrated with the paradigmatic example of ground state cooling, for both arbitrary and energy-preserving unitary operations.</description>

      <title>Structural Vulnerability in Y00 Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper critically analyzes the Y00 protocol, a quantum noise-based stream cipher proposed to enhance classical cryptographic methods through quantum mechanical properties. Despite its promise, we reveal a structural vulnerability that enables the leakage of secret information from measurement outcomes. To systematically evaluate its security, we first formalize the claims of previously proposed Y00 protocols, clarifying their achievements and limitations. We then identify the structural vulnerability through an intuitive explanation and rigorous formulation using maximum likelihood estimation. Our findings demonstrate that Y00's structural weaknesses allow for the unique determination of the shared secret, leading to significant information leakage. Using the "Toy protocol" as a reference model, we contextualize these results within the broader field of security technology. Furthermore, we generalize our findings to a wider class of quantum-based stream cipher protocols, identifying a fundamental security condition that Y00 fails to satisfy. This condition serves as a critical benchmark for ensuring the security of any stream cipher protocol relying on physical states, whether quantum or classical. These findings underscore the importance of rigorous security evaluations, particularly in systems intended for practical applications. Unexamined vulnerabilities not only undermine trust but also expose systems to avoidable risks, making rigorous analysis indispensable for ensuring resilience and security.</description>

      <title>All multiparty quantum systems have state with unconditionally superposition-robust entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inseparability of states generated by superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a product state. In particular, we identify specific multipartite entangled states that will always produce inseparability after superposition with an arbitrary completely product state. Thus, these entangled states are unconditionally superposition-robust, and we refer to this phenomenon as ``unconditional inseparability of superposition" in multipartite quantum systems. In this way, we complete the picture of unconditional inseparability of superposition which was introduced earlier for bipartite systems. We also characterize the superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a pure bi-separable state. However, the present analysis allows us to obtain a more general result, viz. there exists at least one pure entangled state in any multipartite Hilbert space such that its superposition with an arbitrary completely product state always yields an entangled state. On the other hand, for any bipartite pure entangled state, if at least one of the subsystems is a qubit, then it is always possible to find a suitable product state such that the superposition of the entangled state and the product state produces a product state. In this way, we find a feature of multipartite quantum systems which is in sharp contrast with that of bipartite ones. We then show how unconditional inseparability of superposition can be useful in exhibiting an indistinguishability property within the local unambiguous state discrimination problem.</description>

      <title>Pre-detection squeezing as a resource for high-dimensional Bell-state measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell measurements, entailing the projection onto one of the Bell states, play a key role in quantum information and communication, where the outcome of a variety of protocols crucially depends on the success probability of such measurements. Although in the case of qubit systems, Bell measurements can be implemented using only linear optical components, the same result is no longer true for qudits, where at least the use of ancillary photons is required. In order to circumvent this limitation, one possibility is to introduce nonlinear effects. In this work, we adopt the latter approach and propose a scalable Bell measurement scheme for high-dimensional states, exploiting multiple squeezer devices applied to a linear optical circuit for discriminating the different Bell states. Our approach does not require ancillary photons, is not limited by the dimension of the quantum states, and is experimentally scalable, thus paving the way toward the realization of an effective high-dimensional Bell measurement.</description>

      <title>Development of a High-Voltage Output DAC System for Fast Ion-Shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) is one of the notable architectures to achieve large-scale trapped-ion quantum computers. To realize QCCD architecture, ions must be transported quickly while minimizing motional excitation. High-voltage sources are necessary to achieve such high-quality ion transport through a high secular frequency. In this study, we report the development of an FPGA-based DAC system with an output voltage range of +/-50 V and demonstrate its effectiveness in ion transport operations. By optimizing the voltage sets for ion transport, we experimentally confirm that the developed DAC system, when operated with an output range of +/- 50 V, achieves more than twice the secular frequency attainable when its output range is restricted to +/-10 V, a limit commonly associated with conventional DACs. The developed DAC system has good potential to enable fast ion transport with minimal motional excitation, thereby reducing processing times in QCCD-based quantum computers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable, robust approach to creating quantum programs of arbitrary size and complexity. The approach is based on the true abstraction of the problem. The quantum program is expressed in terms of a high-level model together with constraints and objectives on the final program. Advanced synthesis algorithms transform the model into a low-level quantum program that meets the user's specification and is directed at a stipulated hardware. This separation of description from implementation is essential for scale. The technology adapts electronic design automation methods to quantum computing, finding feasible implementations in a virtually unlimited functional space. The results show clear superiority over the compilation and transpilation methods used today. We expect that this technological approach will take over and prevail as quantum software become more demanding, complex, and essential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacuum states, a significant quantum resource, exhibit intricate correlations and unique quantum properties. In this work, we propose a theoretical yet experimentally feasible model to engineer these states using a waveguide trimer. Our study uncovers distinct characteristics of the photon-subtracted state depending on whether an even or odd number of photons is extracted, shedding light on the subtle relationship between quantum state manipulation and the parity of the number of subtracted photons. Furthermore, our integrated device facilitates the generation of multiphoton states with tunable correlations, offering significant potential for applications in quantum-enhanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations and metrological advantage among Unruh-DeWitt detectors in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing debate on Gibbons-Hawking (GH) decoherence centers on its unclear thermal nature. In this work, we investigate the robustness of quantum Fisher information (QFI) and local quantum uncertainty (LQU) in the presence of GH decoherence, using free-falling Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors in de Sitter spacetime (dS-ST). The UDW detectors interact with a massless scalar field in dS-ST and are modeled as open quantum systems, with the field acting as the environment for which we use a master equation to describe their evolution. Our analysis investigates the roles of energy spacing, GH temperature, initial state preparation, and various de Sitter-invariant vacuum sectors on the optimization of QFI and LQU. We find that the optimal values of QFI and LQU depend on the selected de Sitter-invariant vacuum sector and increase with larger energy spacing. Our findings reveal that QFI exhibits resilience to GH decoherence, maintaining a pronounced local peak across a wider range of parameters. This robustness can be further enhanced through strategic initial state preparation and increased energy spacing, resulting in a higher maximum QFI value even under significant environmental decoherence. Our results underscore the critical role of GH thermality in governing QFI and LQU, offering valuable insights for advances in relativistic quantum metrology (RQM).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quantitative theory of quantum coherence, the amount of coherence for given states can be meaningfully discussed only when referring to a preferred basis. One of the objections to this quantification is that the amount of coherence is an intrinsically basis-dependent quantity. This limitation can, however, be lifted when considering a set of quantum states invariant under arbitrary unitary transformations. Thus, we analyze a basis-independent definition of quantum coherence, and the incoherent state is taken as the maximally mixed state. We describe the relationship between the basis-independent and the basis-dependent approaches and give several applications to show the advantages of the former method. The relations among basis-independent coherence, quantum entanglement, and quantum discord are discussed by using the relative entropy within a multipartite system.</description>

      <title>Direct phase encoding in QAOA: Describing combinatorial optimization problems through binary decision variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its derived variants are widely in use for approximating combinatorial optimization problem instances on gate-based Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Commonly, circuits required for QAOA are constructed by first reformulating a given problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. It is then straightforward to synthesize a QAOA circuit from QUBO equations.
  In this work, we illustrate a more qubit-efficient circuit construction for combinatorial optimization problems by the example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Conventionally, the qubit encoding in QAOA for the TSP describes a tour using a sequence of nodes, where each node is written as a 1-hot binary vector. We propose to encode TSP tours by selecting edges included in the tour. Removing certain redundancies, the number of required qubits can be reduced by a linear factor compared to the aforementioned conventional encoding.
  We examined implementations of both QAOA encoding variants in terms of their approximation quality and runtime. Our experiments show that for small instances results are significantly more accurate using our proposed encoding, whereas the number of required classical optimizer iterations increases only slightly.</description>

      <title>Consistent Value Assignments Can Explain Classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work proposes an alternative approach to the problem of the emergence of classicality. Typical approaches developed in the literature derive the classical behaviour of a quantum system from conditions that concern the value of the parameters deemed responsible of non-classicality, like Planck constant.
  Our first step in addressing the problem is instead to identify the physical origin of non-classicality of quantum physics. Nowadays the deepest origin is identified in the impossibility of a simultaneous consistent value assignment to every set of quantum observables. To attack this impossibility a concept of ``evaluation'' is then introduced, which allows for a consistent value assignment to non-comeasurable observables whenever an established set of conditions is satisfied. It is shown that in the case of the motion of the center of mass of a large rigid body evaluations exist that realize a consistent value assignment to both the position and the velocity of the center of mass of the body. In so doing emergence of classicality is explained by overcoming the obstacles to the simultaneous value assignments that allow for a classical description of the phenomenon. This result prompts to search for extensions and generalization of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent Schrodinger equation is solved for two model problems for a non-Hermitian quantum system.A simple matrix model system is used to examine two critical problems for these systems: complex and non-observable energies and situations where the matrix is defective. In addition the stationary states for infinite dimensional model system, which is confined in space , is examined and it is shown that the pattern of eigenvalue energies differs from when the system is unconfined.</description>

      <title>Ad-hoc hybrid-heterogeneous metropolitan-range quantum key distribution network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and implementation of a versatile ad-hoc metropolitan-range Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) network. The approach presented integrates various types of physical channels and QKD protocols, and a mix of trusted and untrusted nodes. Unlike conventional QKD networks that predominantly depend on either fiber-based or free-space optical (FSO) links, the testbed presented amalgamates FSO and fiber-based links, thereby overcoming some inherent limitations. Various network deployment strategies have been considered, including permanent infrastructure and provisional ad-hoc links to eradicate coverage gaps. Furthermore, the ability to rapidly establish a network using portable FSO terminals and to investigate diverse link topologies is demonstrated. The study also showcases the successful establishment of a quantum-secured link to a cloud server.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Storage of Quantum Information in the Genetic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA has been proposed as a chemical platform for computing and data storage, paving the way for building DNA-based computers. Recently, DNA has been hypothesized as an ideal quantum computer with the base pairs working as Josephson junctions. There are still major challenges to be overcome in these directions, but they do not prevent deviceful perspectives of the main problem. The present paper explores DNA base pairs as elementary units for a scalable nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer (NMRQC). First, it presents an overview of the proton transfer (PT) mechanism during the prototropic tautomerism in the base pairs, scoring the current stage. Second, as a proof-of-principle, the paper examines these molecular structures as quantum processing units (QPUs) of a biochemical quantum device. For the model proposed here, it is theoretically demonstrated that the nuclear spins involved in the PT of base pairs can be deterministically prepared in a superposition of triplet states. Under appropriate conditions, the proton dynamics provides the minimal two-qubit entanglement required for quantum computing. The dynamics between the canonical and tautomeric quantum states (CQS and TQS, respectively) is determined from a thermally dependent Watson-Crick quantum superposition (WCQS); i.e., |WCQS&gt; = a(T)|CQS&gt; + b(T)|TQS&gt; with |a(T)|^2 + |b(T)|^2 = 1. If the DNA structure is sufficiently protected to avoid environment-induced decoherence of the confined-proton quantum states, quantum information can be successfully encoded in several base pairs along the coiled double strand. As a potential applicability, a crystalline DNA device could be employed for quantum computing and cryptography controlled by a sequence of Ramsey pulses. Finally, this study critically evaluates these possibilities toward a proof-of-concept of a DNA-based quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling quantum jumps is crucial for reliable quantum computing. In this work, we demonstrate how the quantum Zeno effect can be applied to a two qubit system interacting with an ancilla which is a component of surface code architecture used to control undesired transitions. Further, we show that by designing the interaction and tuning measurement frequency, the quantum Zeno effect can be used to achieve the desired target state in both single-qubit and two qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Optomechanical Hamiltonian from Quadratic Fluctuations of a Moving Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of the radiation pressure interaction to include quadratic fluctuations in the position of a moving mirror, allowing the introduction of a generalized radiation pressure operator that captures higher-order effects in the mirror-field coupling. For mechanical resonators with frequencies comparable to the fundamental cavity frequency, the corrections to the optomechanical Hamiltonian associated with the higher-order radiation pressure operator are quadratic in the standard radiation pressure coupling. The effects generated by this contribute are anticipated to be significant in the strong coupling regime of optomechanics, electromechanics and superconducting circuits analogs.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission in an exponential model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of spontaneous emission can lead to the creation of an imaginary coupling and a shift. To explore this, we utilized the renormalized first Nikitin model, revealing an exponential detuning variation with a phase and an imaginary coupling along with the shift. By employing the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we investigated the behavior of our system. Our findings indicate that the imaginary coupling provides specific information, while the shift generates allowed and forbidden zones in the energy diagram of the real part of the energy. In the diagram of the imaginary part of the energy, time dictates order or chaos in the system and identifies the information transmission zone. Notably, the first Nikitin model exhibits similarities to the Rabi model in the short-time approximation. Our theoretical conclusions are consistent with numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>A clustering aggregation algorithm on neutral-atoms and annealing quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to perform clustering aggregation, designed for neutral-atoms quantum computers and quantum annealers. Clustering aggregation is a technique that mitigates the weaknesses of clustering algorithms, an important class of data science methods for partitioning datasets, and is widely employed in many real-world applications. By expressing the clustering aggregation problem instances as a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem and as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, it was possible to solve them by leveraging the potential of Pasqal's Fresnel (neutral-atoms processor) and D-Wave's Advantage QPU (quantum annealer). Additionally, the designed clustering aggregation algorithm was first validated on a Fresnel emulator based on QuTiP and later on an emulator of the same machine based on tensor networks, provided by Pasqal. The results revealed technical limitations, such as the difficulty of adding additional constraints on the employed neutral-atoms platform and the need for better metrics to measure the quality of the produced clusterings. However, this work represents a step towards a benchmark to compare two different machines: a quantum annealer and a neutral-atom quantum computer. Moreover, findings suggest promising potential for future advancements in hybrid quantum-classical pipelines, although further improvements are needed in both quantum and classical components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approach of direct integration of the three-dimensional Faddeev equations with respect to the breakup T-matrix in momentum space for three bodies of different masses is presented. The Faddeev equations are written out explicitly without the requirement for symmetry or antisymmetry of two-body t matrices, taking into account the difference in the masses of three interacting particles. An algorithm for the algebraic search for non-relativistic wave functions of a system of three bodies of different masses is described. A significant change in the domain of logarithmic singularities of the integral kernels of the Faddeev equations from the choice of masses of interacting particles is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Ternary tree transformations are equivalent to linear encodings of the Fock basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two approaches to designing fermion-qubit mappings: (1) ternary tree transformations, which use Pauli representations of the Majorana operators that correspond to root-to-leaf paths of a tree graph and (2) linear encodings of the Fock basis, such as the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transformations, which store linear binary transformations of the fermionic occupation number vectors in the computational basis of qubits. These approaches have emerged as distinct concepts, with little notational consistency between them. In this paper we propose a universal description of fermion-qubit mappings, which reveals the relationship between ternary tree transformations and linear encodings. Using our notation, we show that every product-preserving ternary tree transformation is equivalent to a linear encoding of the Fock basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear magnetic interactions provide access to complex quantum spin dynamics and thus enable the study of intriguing physical phenomena. However, these interactions are often dominated by the linear Zeeman effect, which can complicate system dynamics and make their analysis more challenging. In this article, we theoretically and experimentally introduce a method to induce the quadratic Zeeman effect while effectively compensating for its linear counterpart. By isolating the quadratic Zeeman contributions, we demonstrate and analyze controlled superposition generation between specific magnetic sublevels in room-temperature rubidium-87 atoms. This study opens avenues for controlling any spin system, regardless of its total angular momentum, which we plan to explore further in the context of quantum-state tomography and engineering (e.g., spin squeezing).</description>

      <title>Direct Fidelity Estimation for Generic Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying the proper preparation of quantum states is essential in modern quantum information science. Various protocols have been developed to estimate the fidelity of quantum states produced by different parties. Direct fidelity estimation is a leading approach, as it typically requires a number of measurements that scale linearly with the Hilbert space dimension, making it far more efficient than full state tomography. In this article, we introduce a novel fidelity estimation protocol for generic quantum states, with an overall computational cost that scales only as the square root of the Hilbert space dimension. Furthermore, our protocol significantly reduces the number of required measurements and the communication cost between parties to finite. This protocol leverages the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm in conjunction with classical shadow tomography to achieve these improvements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the definition of statistics for Abelian anyons, based on string operators in many-body Hilbert space, to arbitrary dimensions of invertible topological excitations on arbitrary manifolds. This theory is rigorous, systematic, and provides a general framework for understanding and proving the properties of statistics. Additionally, we propose several conjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer program for calculating statistics, which has yielded results consistent with predictions from other physical theories.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Operation and Materials Science with Neutral Atom Logical Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the fault-tolerant operation of logical qubits on a neutral atom quantum computer, with logical performance surpassing physical performance for multiple circuits including Bell states (12x error reduction), random circuits (15x), and a prototype Anderson Impurity Model ground state solver for materials science applications (up to 6x, non-fault-tolerantly). The logical qubits are implemented via the [[4, 2, 2]] code (C4). Our work constitutes the first complete realization of the benchmarking protocol proposed by Gottesman 2016 [1] demonstrating results consistent with fault-tolerance. In light of recent advances on applying concatenated C4/C6 detection codes to achieve error correction with high code rates and thresholds, our work can be regarded as a building block towards a practical scheme for fault tolerant quantum computation. Our demonstration of a materials science application with logical qubits particularly demonstrates the immediate value of these techniques on current experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon processes deteriorate the quantum non-demolition (QND) character of the dispersive readout in circuit QED, causing readout to lag behind single and two-qubit gates, in both speed and fidelity. Alternative methods such as the longitudinal readout have been proposed, however, it is unknown to what extent multi-photon processes hinder this approach. Here we investigate the QND character of the longitudinal readout of the transmon qubit. We show that the deleterious effects that arise due to multi-photon transitions can be heavily suppressed with detuning, owing to the fact that the longitudinal interaction strength is independent of the transmon-resonator detuning. We consider the effect of circuit disorder, the selection rules that act on the transmon, as well as the description of longitudinal readout in the classical limit of the transmon to show qualitatively that longitudinal readout is robust. We show that fast, high-fidelity QND readout of transmon qubits is possible with longitudinal coupling.</description>

      <title>Robust analog quantum simulators by quantum error-detecting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving noise resilience is an outstanding challenge in Hamiltonian-based quantum computation. To this end, energy-gap protection provides a promising approach, where the desired quantum dynamics are encoded into the ground space of a penalty Hamiltonian that suppresses unwanted noise processes. However, existing approaches either explicitly require high-weight penalty terms that are not directly accessible in current hardware, or utilize non-commuting $2$-local Hamiltonians, which typically leads to an exponentially small energy gap. In this work, we provide a general recipe for designing error-resilient Hamiltonian simulations, making use of an excited encoding subspace stabilized by solely $2$-local commuting Hamiltonians. Our results thus overcome a no-go theorem previously derived for ground-space encoding that prevents noise suppression schemes with such Hamiltonians. Importantly, our method is scalable as it only requires penalty terms that scale polynomially with system size. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we further apply this method to a variety of $1$- and $2$-dimensional many-body spin models, potentially extending the duration of high-fidelity simulation by orders of magnitude in current hardware.</description>

      <title>Dirac-Equation Signal Processing: Physics Boosts Topological Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological signals are variables or features associated with both nodes and edges of a network. Recently, in the context of Topological Machine Learning, great attention has been devoted to signal processing of such topological signals. Most of the previous topological signal processing algorithms treat node and edge signals separately and work under the hypothesis that the true signal is smooth and/or well approximated by a harmonic eigenvector of the Hodge-Laplacian, which may be violated in practice. Here we propose Dirac-equation signal processing, a framework for efficiently reconstructing true signals on nodes and edges, also if they are not smooth or harmonic, by processing them jointly. The proposed physics-inspired algorithm is based on the spectral properties of the topological Dirac operator. It leverages the mathematical structure of the topological Dirac equation to boost the performance of the signal processing algorithm. We discuss how the relativistic dispersion relation obeyed by the topological Dirac equation can be used to assess the quality of the signal reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate the improved performance of the algorithm with respect to previous algorithms. Specifically, we show that Dirac-equation signal processing can also be used efficiently if the true signal is a non-trivial linear combination of more than one eigenstate of the Dirac equation, as it generally occurs for real signals.</description>

      <title>Optically Switching $\chi^{(2)}$ in Diamond Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced modification of second-harmonic generation mediated by nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in a diamond cavity is observed. Excitation of NV centres quenches the device's second-harmonic emission, and is attributed to modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ by photoionisation from the negative (NV$^-$) to neutral (NV$^0$) charge states.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Cognition to Conceptuality Interpretation I: Tracing the Brussels Group's Intellectual Journey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics proposes that quantum entities have a conceptual nature, interacting with the material world through processes that are the physical counterpart of the meaning-based processes which typically occur in human cognition. This interpretation emerged from the early developments in quantum cognition, a field that uses quantum mathematics to model human cognitive activity. It benefited from the specific approach taken by the Brussels research group, modeling concepts themselves as quantum entities and minds as measuring apparatuses. The article sketches the essential steps of the intellectual journey going from the first applications of quantum notions and formalisms to human cognition to the proposal of a potentially groundbreaking interpretation of quantum mechanics, offering profound explanations for major quantum phenomena. This was done by drawing numerous parallels with the human conceptual domain and suggesting the existence of a level of cognitive activity that would underlie our physical reality. This means that an increased cross-fertilization between the conceptuality interpretation and quantum cognition is to be expected in the future, both of which are synergistic in furthering our understanding of the nature of reality. This is the first part of a two-part article. In the second part, which can be read independently of the first, the successes of the interpretation will be described in a more systematic way, providing a brief overview of what has been achieved so far.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the induced vacuum energy of scalar matter in the background of an impenetrable magnetic tube on the coupling to the space-time curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We considered the vacuum polarization of a quantized charged scalar matter field in the background of a finite-thickness tube with magnetic flux inside. The tube is impenetrable for quantum matter and a Robin-type boundary condition is imposed at its surface. We have shown that in the flat space-time the total induced vacuum energy does not depend on the coupling $(\xi)$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only for the partial cases of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the tube's edge. However, for generalized Robin boundary conditions, the total induced energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in flat space-time, at least for negative values of the boundary condition parameter $-\pi/2&lt;\theta&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Comb Tensor Networks vs. Matrix Product States: Enhanced Efficiency in High-Dimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern approaches to generative modeling of continuous data using tensor networks incorporate compression layers to capture the most meaningful features of high-dimensional inputs. These methods, however, rely on traditional Matrix Product States (MPS) architectures. Here, we demonstrate that beyond a certain threshold in data and bond dimensions, a comb-shaped tensor network architecture can yield more efficient contractions than a standard MPS. This finding suggests that for continuous and high-dimensional data distributions, transitioning from MPS to a comb tensor network representation can substantially reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>The long-range origin of the black hole entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the quantum nature of black holes, particularly their residual entropy at zero temperature. In this work, we investigate the role of long-range interactions in a chain of SYK dots with power-law decaying couplings and demonstrate how these interactions can lead to finite residual entropy in the strong non-local case. Indeed, as a function of the interaction range, the black-hole phase, found in the isolated SYK, melts into a long-range Fermi-liquid phase in the weak long-range regime and finally reaches the non Fermi-liquid phase in the purely local case. Our results pave the way to the understanding of the role of the interaction range in black hole thermodynamics and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Manipulating topological charges via engineering zeros of wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological charges are typically manipulated by managing their energy bands in quantum systems. In this work, we propose a new approach to manipulate the topological charges of systems by engineering density zeros of localized wave excitations in them. We demonstrate via numerical simulation and analytical analysis that the winding number of a toroidal Bose condensate can be well manipulated by engineering the relative velocities between the dark solitons and their backgrounds. The crossing of relative velocities through zero makes a change in winding number by inducing density zeros during acceleration, with the direction of crossing determining whether charge increases or decreases. Possibilities of observing such winding number manipulation are discussed for current experimental settings. This idea may also be to higher dimensions. These results will inspire new pathways in designing topological materials using quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Control, competition and coexistence of effective magnetic orders by interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates with high-Q cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atom systems confined in optical cavities have been demonstrated as a laboratory for the control of quantum matter properties and analog quantum simulation. Often neglected, but soon amenable to manipulation in a new generation of experiments, we show that atomic many-body interactions allow additional control in the cavity driven self-organization of effective spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). We theoretically show that a rich landscape of magnetic ordering configurations emerges. This can be controlled by modifying the geometry of the light-fields in the system with the interplay of two-body interactions and the cavity induced interactions. This leads to competition scenarios and phase separated dynamics. Our results show that it is possible to tailor on demand configurations possibly useful for analog quantum simulation of magnetic materials with highly controllable parameters in a single experimentally realistic setup.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization around cosmic strings in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are the most popular topological defects arising from the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in the early Universe. They are the source of a number of interesting effects in cosmology and astrophysics. An interesting effect is the polarization of the vacuum state for quantum fields induced by the non-trivial topology of the spacetime around cosmic strings. In the present paper we describe the combined effects of the straight cosmic string and the gravitational field on the local properties of scalar, spinor and electromagnetic vacua. The local de Sitter spacetime is considered as the background geometry. It is shown that the influence of the spacetime curvature is essential at distances from the string of the order of or larger than the curvature radius. A qualitatively new feature is the appearance of the vacuum energy flux in the radial direction with respect to the cosmic string.</description>

      <title>Impact of Annealing and Nanostructuring on Properties of NV Centers Created by Different Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds have been an epicenter of research for diverse applications in quantum technologies. It is therefore imperative that their fabrication techniques are well understood and characterized for the technological scalability of these applications. A comparative study of the optical and spin properties of NVs created by ion implantation and chemical vapor deposition delta-doping is thus presented, combined with an investigation on the impact of annealing in vacuum at different temperatures. In addition, nanopillars are fabricated with electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching for enhanced photon collection efficiency. An extensive combination of characterization techniques is employed. Notably, the smallest nanopillars present fluorescence enhancements of factor around 50, compared to the unstructured regions. Annealing is also demonstrated to increase the optical contrast between the NVs' electronic states, the coherence and relaxation times both in bulk as in pillars. Regarding the NV preparation technique, the delta-doping is shown to create NVs with less lattice defects and strain compared to implantation.</description>

      <title>Controlling discrete time crystals via single-site operations in zero-field diamond quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) have emerged as novel nonequilibrium phases of matter that spontaneously break discrete time-translation symmetry in periodically driven systems. Rigorous experimental validation of DTCs, which requires highly controllable quantum simulators, has stimulated extensive research across diverse fields in condensed matter physics and quantum information technologies. Among these advances, DTCs were demonstrated in a hybrid spin register within diamond, comprising a processor spin and surrounding memory spins. However, in conventional strategies involving a bias magnetic field, the field application effectively restricts the controllability of the processor spin. This limitation can be a significant barrier to the next goal of DTCs: achieving multifunctionality through enhanced local controllability. In this study, we theoretically propose multiple DTC protocols through the design of specific single-site control within the entire system. To this end, we consider a concrete model of a diamond-based quantum simulator operating without a bias magnetic field, thereby eliminating the restrictions on the processor spin. Our findings demonstrate that single-site operations enable access to DTCs with multiple distinct features in terms of periodicity and lifetime. Therefore, this approach provides a promising platform for creating diverse DTCs induced by single-site operations.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Performance Evaluation of Quantum, Classical and Hybrid Solvers for the Max-Cut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of quantum, classical, and hybrid solvers on the NP-hard Max-Cut and QUBO problems, examining their solution quality relative to the global optima and their computational efficiency. We benchmark the new fast annealing D-Wave quantum processing unit (QPU) and D-Wave Hybrid solver against the state-of-the-art classical simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and Toshiba's simulated bifurcation machine (SBM). Our study leverages three datasets encompassing 139 instances of the Max-Cut problem with sizes ranging from 100 to 10,000 nodes. For instances below 251 nodes, global optima are known and reported, while for larger instances, we utilize the best-known solutions from the literature. Our findings reveal that for the smaller instances where the global optimum is known, the Hybrid solver and SA algorithm consistently achieve the global optimum, outperforming the QPU. For larger instances where global optima are unknown, we observe that the SBM and the slower variant of SA deliver competitive solution quality, while the Hybrid solver and the faster variant of SA performed noticeably worse. Although computing time varies due to differing underlying hardware, the Hybrid solver and the SBM demonstrate both efficient computation times, while for SA reduction in computation time can be achieved at the expense of solution quality.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing collaboration between the fields of quantum computing and high energy physics, including using LHC processes such as top (anti-)quark pair production to perform high energy tests of quantum entanglement. In this proceeding, I will review another interesting property from quantum computing ("magic"), that is needed to make quantum computers with genuine computational advantage over their classical counterparts. How to make and enhance magic in general quantum systems is an open question, such that new insights are always useful. To this end, I will show that the LHC naturally produces magic top quarks, providing a novel playground for further study in this area.</description>

      <title>Collisional scattering of strongly interacting D-band Feshbach molecules in optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excited bands in optical lattices manifest an important tool for studying quantum simulation and many-body physics, making it crucial to measure high-band scattering dynamics under strong interactions. This work investigates both experimentally and theoretically the collisional scattering of $^{6}\rm Li_2$ molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the $D$ band of a one-dimensional optical lattice, with interaction strength directly tunable via magnetic Feshbach resonance. We find a clear dependence of the $D$-band lifetimes on the interaction strength within the strongly interacting regime, which arises from the fact that the scattering cross-section is proportional to the square of the scattering length. The maximum lifetime versus lattice depth is measured to reveal the effects of interactions. We also investigate the scattering channels of $D$-band molecules under different interaction levels and develop a reliable two-body scattering rate equation. This work provides insight into the interplay between interaction and the collisional scattering of high-band bosons in optical lattices, paving the way for research into strong correlation effects in high-band lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Multi-Entropy Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-partite entanglement structure of an evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation by dividing the radiation into finer subsystems. Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</description>

      <title>Boundary anomaly detection in two-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to detect quantum anomalies in systems with subsystem symmetry, building on the concept of anomaly indicators. This approach allows us to distinguish different subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases and uncover new ones. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the power of this method by identifying strong and weak $Z_2^\tau\times Z_2^\sigma$ SSPT phases in a tunable tensor network state. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic $Z_2$ SSPT phase characterized by its degenerate entanglement spectrum. Furthermore, we extend the anomaly indicator to mixed-state density matrices and show that quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetry can persist under both uniform and alternating disorders. This finding establishes a connection between boundary quantum anomalies in pure and mixed states. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for detecting and constructing topological quantum phases protected by subsystem symmetries, offering new insights into these exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Optically tuned soliton dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates within dark traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the formation and dynamics of solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) within dark traps generated by two crossed Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams with varying azimuthal indices $\ell$. As the index $\ell$ increases, the potential transitions from a harmonic trap when $\ell = 1$ to a square-well potential for larger values of $\ell$. This transition allows us to study a range of soliton dynamics under different confinement conditions while maintaining the same BEC volume. Through the derivation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) and under these specific conditions in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) configurations, we explore the dynamics of solitons across multiple scenarios. The study examines two primary methods for solitons generation: the temporal modulation of the scattering length and the implementation of an initial potential barrier that is subsequently removed. The results indicate that the trap shape plays a critical role in the generation and interaction dynamics of solitons. In harmonic traps, solitons exhibit a behavior different from those observed in anharmonic traps, where the dynamics is significantly influenced by the azimuthal index of the trap. The ability to control soliton dynamics in BECs holds significant promise for applications in quantum technologies, precision sensing, and the exploration of fundamental quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical resonators have shown outstanding abilities to tailor chemical landscapes through enhanced light-matter interaction between confined optical modes and molecule vibrations. We propose a theoretical model to study cooperative vibrational strong coupling in an open quantum system. The non-equilibrium stochastic molecular dynamics in an optical cavity with an auxiliary ensemble is investigated. It shows that coupling with a cavity mode introduces an additional colored noise and a negative feedback, both of which enable control over thermalization rates (i.e. the lifetime of excitation) of reactive molecules. Our work offers a pathway to steer stability of chemical bonds for chemical reactivity under cooperative vibrational strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Anti-thermalization: Heating by cooling and vice versa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common intuition tells us that if one part of a connected system is cooled continuously, the other parts should also cool down. This intuition can be given a microscopic foundation for the case of a generic quantum system coupled to a "lead" that is maintained at a given temperature. We show that by suppressing resonant energy exchange between the two parts, one can reverse the fate of the system, namely, it can heat up toward its most excited state as the lead is cooled to its ground state, and vice versa. This anti-thermal dynamics arises in a broad class of systems with a conserved $U(1)$ charge, and can be tested with two qubits in existing setups. We show that the mechanism allows one to prepare mid-spectrum nonclassical states, stable temperature gradients in closed systems, and highly athermal states where subspaces heat in the presence of overall cooling. Our findings highlight the critical role played by the nature of the coupling and reveal a rich interplay between symmetry and resonance effects in the dynamics of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Atomic-optical interferometry in fractured loops: a general solution for Rydberg radio frequency receivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07632v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of novel radio frequency atomic receivers brings attention to the theoretical description of atom-light interactions in sophisticated, multilevel schemes. Of special interest, are the schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>BATIS: Bootstrapping, Autonomous Testing, and Initialization System for Quantum Dot Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. As the complexity of QD devices grows, manual tuning becomes increasingly infeasible, necessitating robust and scalable autotuning solutions. Tuning large arrays of QD qubits depends on efficient choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS), an automated framework designed to streamline QD device testing and initialization. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing and gate characterization. The current channel formation protocol follows a novel and scalable approach that requires a single measurement regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

      <title>Fiat-Shamir for Proofs Lacks a Proof Even in the Presence of Shared Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02265v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the cryptographic power of arbitrary shared physical resources. The most general such resource is access to a fresh entangled quantum state at the outset of each protocol execution. We call this the Common Reference Quantum State (CRQS) model, in analogy to the well-known Common Reference String (CRS). The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but appears to be more powerful: in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes exhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle queried once by measuring a maximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases. We formalize this notion as a Weak One-Time Random Oracle (WOTRO), where we only ask of the $m$-bit output to have some randomness when conditioned on the $n$-bit input.
  We show that when $n-m\in\omega(\lg n)$, any protocol for WOTRO in the CRQS model can be attacked by an (inefficient) adversary. Moreover, our adversary is efficiently simulatable, which rules out the possibility of proving the computational security of a scheme by a fully black-box reduction to a cryptographic game assumption. On the other hand, we introduce a non-game quantum assumption for hash functions that implies WOTRO in the CRQS model (where the CRQS consists only of EPR pairs). We first build a statistically secure WOTRO protocol where $m=n$, then hash the output.
  The impossibility of WOTRO has the following consequences. First, we show the fully-black-box impossibility of a quantum Fiat-Shamir transform, extending the impossibility result of Bitansky et al. (TCC 2013) to the CRQS model. Second, we show a fully-black-box impossibility result for a strenghtened version of quantum lightning (Zhandry, Eurocrypt 2019) where quantum bolts have an additional parameter that cannot be changed without generating new bolts. Our results also apply to $2$-message protocols in the plain model.</description>

      <title>Testing the necessity of complex numbers in traditional quantum theory with quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent experiment testing the necessity of complex numbers in the standard formulation of quantum theory is recreated using IBM quantum computers. To motivate the experiment, we present a basic construction for real-valued quantum theory. The real-valued description is shown to predict correlations identical to those of complex-valued quantum mechanics for two types of Bell tests based on the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. A slight modification to one test, however, results in different predictions for the real- and complex-valued constructions. While noisier devices are incapable of delivering convincing results, it is shown that certain devices possess sufficiently small error rates to falsify real-valued formulations of quantum theory for composite states. The results obtained with quantum computers are consistent with published experiments. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using freely-available quantum devices to explore foundational features of quantum mechanics with minimal technical expertise. Accordingly, this treatment could inspire novel projects for undergraduate students taking a course on quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: The ongoing quest to discover new phenomena at the LHC necessitates the continuous development of algorithms and technologies. Established approaches like machine learning, along with emerging technologies such as quantum computing show promise in the enhancement of experimental capabilities. In this work, we propose a strategy for anomaly detection tasks at the LHC based on unsupervised quantum machine learning, and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying new phenomena. The designed quantum models, an unsupervised kernel machine and two clustering algorithms, are trained to detect new-physics events using a latent representation of LHC data, generated by an autoencoder designed to accommodate current quantum hardware limitations on problem size. For kernel-based anomaly detection, we implement an instance of the model on a quantum computer, and we identify a regime where it significantly outperforms its classical counterparts. We show that the observed performance enhancement is related to the quantum resources utilised by the model.</description>

      <title>A novel $2$ \&amp; $3$ player scheme for Quantum Direct Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces two information-theoretically secure protocols that achieve quantum secure direct communication between Alice and Bob in the first case, and among Alice, Bod and Charlie in the second case. Both protocols use the same novel method to embed the secret information in the entangled compound system. The way of encoding the information is the main novelty of this paper and the distinguishing feature compared to previous works in this field. The most critical advantage of this method is that it is easily scalable and extensible because it can be seamlessly generalized to a setting involving three, or even more, players, as demonstrated with the second protocol. This trait can be extremely beneficial when many spatially separated players posses only part the secret information that must be combined and transmitted to Alice, so that she can obtain the complete secret. Using the three player protocol, this task can be achieved in one go, without the need to apply a typical QSDC protocol twice, where Alice first receives Bob's information and afterwards Charlie's information. The proposed protocol doesn't require pre-shared keys or quantum signatures, making it less complicated and more straightforward. Finally, by employing only standard CNOT and Hadamard gates, it offers the important practical advantage of being implementable on contemporary quantum computers, especially in view of the coming era of quantum distributed computing.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Formulation for Traffic Signal Optimization on Real-World Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The D-Wave quantum annealing machine can quickly find the optimal solution for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). One of the applications where the use of quantum annealing is desired is in problems requiring rapid calculations. One such application is the traffic signal optimization. Several studies have used quantum annealing; however, they are formulated in relatively unrealistic settings, such as only crossroads on a map. We propose a different formulation of QUBO that can also deal with T-junctions and multi-forked roads. The simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) was used to validate the efficiency of our approach and verify the feasibility of real-time control using geographical information data that were very similar to the real world. Our model could reduce the waiting time at red lights for vehicles. In addition, we compared our results with those of the Gurobi Optimizer to confirm whether the D-Wave machine could find the ground state. Unfortunately, our results show that the D-Wave machine could not find the optimal solution and was slower than the Gurobi Optimizer in computation time.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the subsystem size scaling of the entanglement entropy of a non-ergodic pure state that can be described by a multi-parametric Gaussian ensemble of complex matrices in a bipartite basis. Our analysis indicates, for a given set of global constraints, the existence of infinite number of universality classes of local complexity, characterized by the complexity parameter, for which the entanglement entropy reveals a universal scaling with subsystem size. A rescaling of the complexity parameter helps us to identify the critical regime for the entanglement entropy of a broad range of pure non-ergodic states.</description>

      <title>On the connection between least squares, regularization, and classical shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical shadows (CS) offer a resource-efficient means to estimate quantum observables, circumventing the need for exhaustive state tomography. Here, we clarify and explore the connection between CS techniques and least squares (LS) and regularized least squares (RLS) methods commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. By formal identification of LS and RLS "shadows" completely analogous to those in CS -- namely, point estimators calculated from the empirical frequencies of single measurements -- we show that both RLS and CS can be viewed as regularizers for the underdetermined regime, replacing the pseudoinverse with invertible alternatives. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate RLS and CS from three distinct angles: the tradeoff in bias and variance, mismatch between the expected and actual measurement distributions, and the interplay between the number of measurements and number of shots per measurement. Compared to CS, RLS attains lower variance at the expense of bias, is robust to distribution mismatch, and is more sensitive to the number of shots for a fixed number of state copies -- differences that can be understood from the distinct approaches taken to regularization. Conceptually, our integration of LS, RLS, and CS under a unifying "shadow" umbrella aids in advancing the overall picture of CS techniques, while practically our results highlight the tradeoffs intrinsic to these measurement approaches, illuminating the circumstances under which either RLS or CS would be preferred, such as unverified randomness for the former or unbiased estimation for the latter.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical proposal for preparing and manipulating a state of a single continuous-variable degree of freedom confined to a nonharmonic potential. By utilizing optimally controlled modulation of the potential's position and depth, we demonstrate the generation of non-Gaussian states, including Fock, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill, multi-legged-cat, and cubic-phase states, as well as the implementation of arbitrary unitaries within a selected two-level subspace. Additionally, we propose protocols for single-shot orthogonal state discrimination, algorithmic cooling, and correcting for nonlinear evolution. We analyze the robustness of this control scheme against noise. Since all the presented protocols rely solely on the precise modulation of the effective nonharmonic potential landscape, they are relevant to several experiments with continuous-variable systems, including the motion of a single particle in an optical tweezer or lattice, or current in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental Liouvillian exceptional points in a quantum system without Hamiltonian singularities</title>

Abstract: Hamiltonian exceptional points (HEPs) are spectral degeneracies of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing classical and semiclassical open systems with losses and/or gain. However, this definition overlooks the occurrence of quantum jumps in the evolution of open quantum systems. These quantum effects are properly accounted for by considering quantum Liouvillians and their exceptional points (LEPs). Specifically, an LEP corresponds to the coalescence of two or more eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenmatrices of a given Liouvillian at critical values of external parameters [Minganti \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 100}, 062131 (2019)]. Here, we explicitly describe how standard quantum process tomography, which reveals the dynamics of a quantum system, can be readily applied to detect and characterize quantum LEPs of quantum non-Hermitian systems. We conducted experiments on an IBM quantum processor to implement a prototype model with one-, two-, and three qubits simulating the decay of a single qubit through competing channels, resulting in LEPs but not HEPs. Subsequently, we performed tomographic reconstruction of the corresponding experimental Liouvillian and its LEPs using both single- and two-qubit operations. This example underscores the efficacy of process tomography in tuning and observing LEPs even in the absence of HEPs.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically derive the probability densities of the entanglement measures of a pure non-ergodic many-body state, represented in a bipartite product basis and with its reduced density matrix described by a generalized, multi-parametric Wishart ensemble with unit trace. Our results indicate significant fluctuations of the measures around their average behavior (specifically for the states away from separability and maximum entanglement limits). The information is relevant not only for hierarchical arrangement of entangled states (e.g., revealing the flaws in their characterization based on average behavior) but also for phase transition studies of many body systems.</description>

      <title>Guided Quantum Compression for High Dimensional Data Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning provides a fundamentally different approach to analyzing data. However, many interesting datasets are too complex for currently available quantum computers. Present quantum machine learning applications usually diminish this complexity by reducing the dimensionality of the data, e.g., via auto-encoders, before passing it through the quantum models. Here, we design a classical-quantum paradigm that unifies the dimensionality reduction task with a quantum classification model into a single architecture: the guided quantum compression model. We exemplify how this architecture outperforms conventional quantum machine learning approaches on a challenging binary classification problem: identifying the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Furthermore, the guided quantum compression model shows better performance compared to the deep learning benchmark when using solely the kinematic variables in our dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces an interaction between two quantum systems with a single simultaneous round of communication and shared entanglement. We study two classes of NLQC, $f$-routing and $f$-BB84, which are of relevance to classical information theoretic cryptography and quantum position-verification. We give the first non-trivial lower bounds on entanglement in both settings, but are restricted to lower bounding protocols with perfect correctness. Within this setting, we give a lower bound on the Schmidt rank of any entangled state that completes these tasks for a given function $f(x,y)$ in terms of the rank of a matrix $g(x,y)$ whose entries are zero when $f(x,y)=0$, and strictly positive otherwise. This also leads to a lower bound on the Schmidt rank in terms of the non-deterministic quantum communication complexity of $f(x,y)$. Because of a relationship between $f$-routing and the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive studied in information theoretic cryptography, we obtain a new technique for lower bounding the randomness complexity of CDS.</description>

      <title>Accommodating Fabrication Defects on Floquet Codes with Minimal Hardware Requirements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet codes are an intriguing generalisation of stabiliser and subsystem codes, which can provide good fault-tolerant characteristics while benefiting from reduced connectivity requirements in hardware. A recent question of interest has been how to run Floquet codes on devices which have defective -- and therefore unusable -- qubits. This is an under-studied issue of crucial importance for running such codes on realistic hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce a new method of accommodating defective qubits on a wide range of two-dimensional Floquet codes, which requires no additional connectivity in the underlying quantum hardware, no modifications to the original Floquet code's measurement schedule, can accommodate boundaries, and is optimal in terms of the number of qubits and stabilisers removed. We numerically demonstrate that, using this method, the planar honeycomb code is fault tolerant up to a fabrication defect probability of $\approx 12\%$. We find the fault-tolerant performance of this code under defect noise is competitive with that of the surface code, despite its sparser connectivity. We finally propose multiple ways this approach can be adapted to the underlying hardware, through utilising any additional connectivity available, and treating defective auxiliary qubits separately to defective data qubits. Our work therefore serves as a guide for the implementation of Floquet codes in realistic quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A consolidated and accessible security proof for finite-size decoy-state quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum key distribution (QKD) has evolved from a scientific research field to a commercially available security solution, supported by mathematically formulated security proofs. However, since the knowledge required for a full understanding of a security proof is scattered across numerous publications, it has proven difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of all steps involved in the process and their limitations without considerable effort and attention to detail. Our paper aims to address this issue by providing a rigorous and comprehensive security proof for the finite-size 1-decoy and 2-decoy BB84 protocols against coherent attacks within Renner's entropic uncertainty relation framework. We resolve important technical flaws found in previous works regarding the fixed-length treatment of protocols and the careful handling of acceptance testing. To this end, we provide various technical arguments, including an analysis accounting for the important distinction of the 1-decoy protocol where statistics are computed after error correction, along with a slight improvement of the secure-key length. We also explicitly clarify the aspect of conditioning on events, addressing a technical detail often overlooked and essential for rigorous proofs. We extensively consolidate and unify concepts from many works, thoroughly discussing the underlying assumptions and resolving technical inconsistencies. Therefore, our contribution represents a significant advancement towards a broader and deeper understanding of QKD security proofs.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Entangled Quantum Noise Radar Over Order of Kilometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an explicit expression for the maximum detection range of an entangled quantum two-mode squeezed (QTMS) radar, in which a two-mode squeezed vacuum state of microwave electromagnetic fields is used, have been derived by considering both the quantum properties of the entangled microwave fields and radar parameters. By comparing this equation with that of traditional radars, we showed that one can though a QTMS radar as a traditional radar with a reduced threshold signal-to-noise ratio. By discussing the current limitations, it has been shown that the critical parameter to have both simultaneous quantum advantage and substantial radar range is increasing the bandwidth of the generated output signal in the quantum entangled source. It has been shown that by considering the current feasible system parameters, it is possible to implement a QTMS radar with maximum detection range up to the order of $2\mathrm{km}$, which is suitable for recognizing small unmanned aerial vehicles in urban distances. Moreover, based on the false alarm rate, we introduce two classes of early alarm and track QTMS radars. The present approach can be generalized to other quantum radars with different types of quantum sources like electro-opto-mechanical sources, and also may shed new light on investigating the quantum radar system toward practical applications. Finally, we have discussed the potential outlooks to improve and develop the quantum entangled radar systems to be practical from the engineering point of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective phenomena arise from interactions within complex systems, leading to behaviors absent in individual components. Observing quantum collective phenomena with macroscopic mechanical oscillators has been impeded by the stringent requirement that oscillators be identical. Here, we demonstrate the quantum regime for collective motion of $N=6$ mechanical oscillators, a hexamer, in a superconducting circuit optomechanical platform. By increasing the optomechanical couplings, the system transitions from individual to collective motion, characterized by a $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement of cavity-collective mode coupling, akin to super-radiance of atomic ensembles. Using sideband cooling, we prepare the collective mode in the quantum ground state and measure its quantum sideband asymmetry, with zero-point motion distributed across distant oscillators. This regime of optomechanics opens avenues for studying multi-partite entanglement, with potential advances in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Light Cones in Long-range Interacting Spin Chains due to Destructive Interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a mechanism in long-range Heisenberg spin chains at low temperatures that results in the emergence of effective entanglement light cones. This mechanism arises from destructive interference among quantum effects entangling spins outside an identified light cone. As a result, entanglement is suppressed in this region, enabling the formation of effective light cones. The analysis shows that truncating the range of interactions diminishes the destructive interference, leading to an unexpected acceleration of entanglement transport along the chain and offering new opportunities to experimentally demonstrate the destructive interference phenomenon. This work provides a fresh perspective on the physical mechanism underlying the emergence of light cones in long-range interacting quantum systems</description>

      <title>Charge and Flux Noise from Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Energy Distributions in Superconducting Qubits and Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiparticle density observed in low-temperature superconducting circuits is several orders of magnitude larger than the value expected at thermal equilibrium. The tunneling of this excess of quasiparticles across Josephson junctions is recognized as one of the main loss and decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Here we propose an additional loss mechanism arising from nonequilibrium quasiparticle densities: Ohmic loss due to quasiparticles residing in superconducting wires away from the junctions. Our theory leverages the recent experimental demonstration that the excess quasiparticles are in quasiequilibrium [T. Connolly et al., $\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.217001}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 132}, 217001 (2024)}$] and uses a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to predict the amount of charge and flux noise generated by them. We show that the resulting contribution to qubit and resonator energy relaxation rate $1/T_1$ can be larger than the one due to amorphous two-level systems and comparable to the contribution from quasipaticle-tunneling. We also discuss the flux noise associated to charge noise fluctuations. For quasiparticles in quasiequilibrium the associated flux noise is logarithmic-in-frequency, giving rise to a "nearly white" contribution that is comparable to the flux noise observed in experiments. This contrasts to amorphous two-level systems, whose associated flux noise is shown to be superOhmic. In conclusion, wire-resident quasiparticles are a universal source of loss and decoherence even when the quasiparticles are far away from Josephson junctions.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a novel quantum system characterization and error mitigation framework that applies Pauli check sandwiching (PCS). We motivate our work with prior art in software optimizations for quantum programs like noise-adaptive mapping and multi-programming, and we introduce the concept of PCS while emphasizing design considerations for its practical use. We show that by carefully embedding Pauli checks within a target application (i.e. a quantum circuit), we can learn quantum system noise profiles. Further, PCS combined with multi-programming unlocks non-trivial fidelity improvements.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we derive the Wigner current of the particle in a multidimensional billiard -- the compact region of space in which the particle moves freely. The calculation is based on proposed by us previously method of imposing boundary conditions by convolution of the free particle Wigner function with some time independent function, defined by the shape of the billiard. This method allowed to greatly simplify the general expression for the Wigner current, representing its $\mathbf{p}$-component as a surface integral of the product of the shifted particles wave functions. The results are also connected to an alternative approach, which takes into account the boundary conditions by adding the $\propto \delta'(x)$ term to the Hamiltonian. The latter is also generalized to the multidimensional case.</description>

Abstract: We address the challenge of simulating unitary quantum dynamics in large systems using Neural Quantum States, focusing on overcoming the computational instabilities and high cost of existing methods. This work offers a comprehensive formalization of the projected time-dependent Variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method by thoroughly analyzing its two essential components: stochastic infidelity minimization and discretization of the unitary evolution. We investigate neural infidelity minimization using natural gradient descent strategies, identifying the most stable stochastic estimators and introducing adaptive regularization strategies that eliminate the need for manual adjustment of the hyperparameter along the dynamics. We formalize the specific requirements that p-tVMC imposes on discretization schemes for them to be efficient, and introduce four high-order integration schemes combining Taylor expansions, Pad\'e approximants, and Trotter splitting to enhance accuracy and scalability. We benchmark our adaptive methods against a 2D Ising quench, matching state of the art techniques without manual tuning of hyperparameters. This work establishes p-tVMC as a highly promising framework for addressing complex quantum dynamics, offering a compelling alternative for researchers looking to push the boundaries of quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>A memory and gate efficient algorithm for unitary mixed Schur sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formalize the task of unitary Schur sampling -- an extension of weak Schur sampling -- which is the process of measuring the Young label and the unitary group register of an input $m$ qudit state. Intuitively, this task is equivalent to applying the Schur transform, projecting onto the isotypic subspaces of the unitary and symmetric groups indexed by the Young labels, and discarding of the permutation register. As such unitary Schur sampling is the natural task in processes such as quantum state tomography or spectrum estimation. We generalize this task to unitary mixed Schur sampling to account for the recently introduced mixed Schur-Weyl transform. We provide a streaming algorithm which achieves an exponential reduction in the memory complexity and a polynomial reduction in the gate complexity over na\"ive algorithms for the task of unitary (mixed) Schur sampling. Further, we show that if the input state has limited rank, the gate and memory complexities of our streaming algorithm as well as the algorithms for the full Schur and mixed Schur transforms are further reduced. Our work generalizes and improves on the results in arXiv2309.11947.</description>

      <title>Zero-energy Quantum Many-Body Scar under Emergent Chiral Symmetry and Pseudo Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) is a mechanism for generating quantum many-body scar (QMBS), which provides a route to weakly break ergodicity. The zero-energy QMBSs widely exist across various systems due to the intertwining of chiral symmetry and spatial inversion symmetry. In this work, we study the phenomenology of the zero-energy QMBS under the interplay between the chiral symmetry and pseudo HSF, where the Hilbert space is approximately fragmented into different blocks. We consider a model of tilted chain of interacting spinless fermions with periodically varying tunneling strength. At small tunneling strength and under resonance condition, the system is described by an effective model with chiral symmetry and pseudo HSF. We find that the interplay between the two gives rise to a highly localized zero-energy QMBS when the particle number is even. We identify a simple product state to signalize the zero-energy QMBS, which gives rise to unusual scarred dynamics. The fidelity oscillates around a fixed value without decaying instead of showing the usual collapse and revival in common scarred systems. We show that the signature of the zero-energy QMBS can also be captured by the original Hamiltonian. Our results uncover a new scar phenomenon and provide an example that does not need the intertwining of chiral and spatial symmetries to support zero-energy QMBS.</description>

      <title>A cat qubit stabilization scheme using a voltage biased Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DC-voltage-biased Josephson junctions have been recently employed in superconducting circuits for Hamiltonian engineering, demonstrating microwave amplification, single photon sources and entangled photon generation. Compared to more conventional approaches based on parametric pumps, this solution typically enables larger interaction strengths. In the context of quantum information, a two-to-one photon interaction can stabilize cat qubits, where bit-flip errors are exponentially suppressed, promising significant resource savings for quantum error correction. This work investigates how the DC bias approach to Hamiltonian engineering can benefit cat qubits. We find a simple circuit design that is predicted to showcase a two-to-one photon exchange rate larger than that of the parametric pump-based implementation while dynamically averaging typically resonant parasitic terms such as Kerr and cross Kerr. In addition to addressing qubit stabilization, we propose to use injection locking with a cat-qubit adapted frequency filter to prevent long-term drifts of the cat qubit angle associated to DC voltage noise. The whole scheme is simulated without rotating-wave approximations, highlighting for the first time the amplitude of related oscillatory effects in cat-qubit stabilization schemes. This study lays the groundwork for the experimental realization of such a circuit.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Quantum Energy Teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore quantum energy teleportation (QET) protocols, focusing on their behavior at finite temperatures and in excited states. We analyze the role of entanglement as a resource for QET, particularly in thermal states, and compare the performance of QET across various initial states. We then introduce a method to extract ground-state energy through a protocol that employs only quantum measurements, local operations, and classical communication (LOCC), without requiring the ground state to be entangled. To illustrate this, we propose a minimal model comprising two interacting qubits. These findings indicate that, in addition to the established QET framework where entanglement serves as a resource, it is possible to extract energy from an unentangled ground state. This broadens the scope of QET's applicability across diverse quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing inspired paintings: reinterpreting classical masterpieces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to apply a quantum computing technique to compose artworks. The main idea is to revisit three paintings of different styles and historical periods: ''Narciso'', painted circa 1597-1599 by Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), ''Les fils de l'homme'', painted in 1964 by Rene Magritte and ''192 Farben'', painted in 1966 by Gerard Richter. We utilize the output of a quantum computation to change the composition in the paintings, leading to a paintings series titled ''Quantum Transformation I, II, III''. In particular, the figures are discretized into square lattices and the order of the pieces is changed according to the result of the quantum simulation. We consider an Ising Hamiltonian as the observable in the quantum computation and its time evolution as the final outcome. From a classical subject to abstract forms, we seek to combine classical and quantum aesthetics through these three art pieces. Besides experimenting with hardware runs and circuit noise, our goal is to reproduce these works as physical oil paintings on wooden panels. With this process, we complete a full circle between classical and quantum techniques and contribute to rethinking Art practice in the era of quantum computing technologies.</description>

Abstract: A review of the nonlocal electromagnetic response functions for the degenerate electron gas, computed within standard perturbation theory, is given. These expressions due to Lindhard, Klimontovich and Silin are used to re-analyze the Casimir interaction between two thick conducting plates in the leading order at high temperatures (zero'th term of Matsubara series). Up to small corrections that we discuss, the results of the conventional Drude model are confirmed. The difference between longitudinal and transverse permittivities (or polarization tensors) yields the Landau (orbital) diamagnetism of the electron gas.</description>

      <title>Fundamental bounds on precision and response for quantum trajectory observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision and response of trajectory observables offer valuable insights into the behavior of nonequilibrium systems. For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermo-kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of general observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser and a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the fermionic satisfiability problem, Fermionic $k$-SAT: this is the problem of deciding whether there is a fermionic state in the null-space of a collection of fermionic, parity-conserving, projectors on $n$ fermionic modes, where each fermionic projector involves at most $k$ fermionic modes. We prove that this problem can be solved efficiently classically for $k=2$. In addition, we show that deciding whether there exists a satisfying assignment with a given fixed particle number parity can also be done efficiently classically for Fermionic 2-SAT: this problem is a quantum-fermionic extension of asking whether a classical 2-SAT problem has a solution with a given Hamming weight parity. We also prove that deciding whether there exists a satisfying assignment for particle-number-conserving Fermionic 2-SAT for some given particle number is NP-complete. Complementary to this, we show that Fermionic 9-SAT is QMA$_1$-hard.</description>

      <title>Magnetic catalysis in weakly interacting hyperbolic Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the linearly vanishing density of states, emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles resulting from the free fermion motion in a family of two-dimensional half-filled bipartite hyperbolic lattices feature dynamic mass generation through quantum phase transitions only for sufficiently strong finite-range Coulomb repulsion. As such, strong nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion ($V$) favors the nucleation of a charge-density-wave (CDW) order with a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between two sublattices of bipartite hyperbolic lattices. Considering a collection of spinless fermions (for simplicity), here we show that application of strong external magnetic fields by virtue of producing a \emph{finite} density of states near the zero energy triggers the condensation of the CDW order even for \emph{infinitesimal} $V$. The proposed curved space magnetic catalysis mechanism is operative for uniform and inhomogeneous (bell-shaped) magnetic fields. We present scaling of the CDW order with the total flux enclosed by hyperbolic Dirac materials for a wide range of (especially subcritical) $V$.</description>

      <title>Observation of pattern stabilization in a driven superfluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of patterns in driven systems has been studied extensively, and their emergence can be connected to a fine balance of instabilities and stabilization mechanisms. While the early phase of pattern formation can be understood on the basis of linear stability analyses, the long-time dynamics can only be described by accounting for the interactions between the excitations generated by the drive. Here, we observe the stabilization of square patterns in an interaction-driven, two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. These patterns emerge due to inherent high-order processes that become relevant in the regime of large phonon occupations. Theoretically, this can be understood as the emergence of a stable fixed point of coupled nonlinear amplitude equations, which include phonon-phonon interactions. We experimentally probe the predicted flows towards such a stable fixed-point, as well as repulsion from a saddle fixed-point, using the experimental control unique to quantum gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in atomic physics have led to the possibility of a coherent transformation between ultra-cold atoms and molecules including between completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of generic interaction between the constituent atoms and molecules can fundamentally alter the nature of the critical point, change the yield of the reaction and the order of the consequent phase transition. We find that the correlations introduced by this interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics such as coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective formation of squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We provide analytical and numerical descriptions of these effects, along with scaling laws for the reaction yield in non-adiabatic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a driven homogeneous 2D Bose gas. Starting with an equilibrium condensate, we drive the gas isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size, and observe a nonthermal population of modes with wavelengths larger than the drive one. At long drive times, the gas exhibits a steady nonthermal momentum distribution. At lengthscales increasing from the drive one to the system size, this distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we reveal the complete qualitative picture of how the steady-state cascade forms.</description>

      <title>Polarization Purity and Dispersion Characteristics of Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Hollow-Core Optical Fiber at Near- and Short-wave-IR Wavelengths for Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum communication and sensing require improved optical transmission that ensures excellent state purity and reduced losses. While free-space optical communication is often preferred, its use becomes challenging over long distances due to beam divergence, atmospheric absorption, scattering, and turbulence, among other factors. In the case of polarization encoding, traditional silica-core optical fibers, though commonly used, struggle with maintaining state purity due to stress-induced birefringence. Hollow core fibers, and in particular nested antiresonant nodeless fibers (NANF), have recently been shown to possess unparalleled polarization purity with minimal birefringence in the telecom wavelength range using continuous-wave (CW) laser light. Here, we investigate a 1-km NANF designed for wavelengths up to the 2-$\mu$m waveband. Our results show a polarization extinction ratio between ~-30 dB and ~-70 dB across the 1520 to 1620 nm range in CW operation, peaking at ~-60 dB at the 2-$\mu$m design wavelength. Our study also includes the pulsed regime, providing insights beyond previous CW studies, e.g., on the propagation of broadband quantum states of light in NANF at 2 $\mu$m, and corresponding extinction-ratio-limited quantum bit error rates (QBER) for prepare-measure and entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Our findings highlight the potential of these fibers in emerging applications such as QKD, pointing towards a new standard in optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue the feasibility to study the phase structure of a quantum physical system on quantum devices via adiabatic preparation of states. We introduce a novel method and successfully test it in application to the Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term. We explore the first-order-phase-transition and the no-transition regions of the corresponding phase diagram. The core idea of the method is to separately evolve the ground and the first excited states with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the time-dependence of which interpolates between different values of $\theta$. Despite our approach being a direct application of the adiabatic theorem, in some cases we are able to demonstrate its advantages in comparison to a different method from the literature that also employs adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonant frequency modulation spectroscopy has been previously used as a highly-sensitive method for measuring the output of cold atom interferometers. Using a detailed model that accounts for optical saturation, laser intensities and atomic densities that vary spatially, and radiation pressure on the atoms, we theoretically investigate under what parameter regimes the optimum signal-to-noise ratio is found under experimentally realistic conditions. We compare this technique to the standard method of fluorescence imaging and find that it outperforms fluorescence imaging for compact interferometers using condensed atomic sources or where the photon collection efficiency is limited. However, we find that fluorescence imaging is likely to be the preferred method when using squeezed atomic sources due to limited atom number.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Origin of Spacetime Non-Commutativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic interpretation of spacetime non-commutativity starting from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanical commutation relations. We discuss how the (non-)commutativity of spacetime is inherently related to the continuity or discontinuity of paths in the path integral formulation. Utilizing Wiener processes, we demonstrate that continuous paths lead to commutative spacetime, whereas discontinuous paths correspond to non-commutative spacetime structures. As an example we introduce discontinuous paths from which the $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutators can be obtained. Moreover we focus on modifications of the Leibniz rule for differentials acting on discontinuous trajectories. We show how these can be related to the deformed action of translation generators focusing, as a working example, on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Our findings suggest that spacetime non-commutativity can be understood as a result of fundamental discreteness in temporal and/or spatial evolution.</description>

      <title>Tridiagonal Hamiltonians modeling the density of states of the Double-Scaled SYK model</title>

Abstract: By analyzing the global density of states (DOS) in the Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) model, we construct a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian that replicates this DOS. We then tridiagonalize the Hamiltonian to determine the mean Lanczos coefficients within the parameter range. The bulk Lanczos coefficients, especially the Lanczos descent can be analytically expressed as a particular $q$-deformation of the logarithm. Our numerical results are further corroborated by semi-analytical findings, a random matrix potential construction in the bulk, and the analytic results at the edge of the Lanczos spectra using the method of moments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the confinement string in (2 + 1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics with a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact lattice Quantum Electrodynamics is a complex quantum field theory with dynamical gauge and matter fields and it has similarities with Quantum Chromodynamics, in particular asymptotic freedom and confinement. We consider a (2+1)-dimensional lattice discretization of Quantum Electrodynamics with the inclusion of dynamical fermionic matter. We define a suitable quantum algorithm to measure the static potential as a function of the distance between two charges on the lattice and we use a variational quantum calculation to explore the Coulomb, confinement and string breaking regimes. A symmetry-preserving and resource-efficient variational quantum circuit is employed to prepare the ground state of the theory at various values of the coupling constant, corresponding to different physical distances, allowing the accurate extraction of the static potential from a quantum computer. We demonstrate that results from quantum experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion device and emulator, with full connectivity between qubits, agree with classical noiseless simulations using circuits with 10 and 24 qubits. Moreover, we visualize the electric field flux configurations that mostly contribute in the wave-function of the quantum ground state in the different regimes of the potential, thus giving insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking. These results are a promising step forward in the grand challenge of solving higher dimensional lattice gauge theory problems with quantum computing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>
