      <title>A Multi-Level Monte Carlo Tree Search Method for Configuration Generation in Crystalline Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the construction of structural models for the description of substitutional defects in crystalline materials. Predicting and designing the atomic structures in such systems is highly challenging due to the combinatorial growth of atomic arrangements and the ruggedness of the associated landscape. We develop a multi-level Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to generate the "optimal" configuration within a supercell. Our method explores the configuration space with an expanding search tree through random sampling, which further incorporates a hierarchical decomposition of the crystalline structure to accelerate exploration and reduce redundancy. We perform numerical experiments on some typical crystalline systems to demonstrate the efficiency of our method in identifying optimal configurations.</description>

      <title>Resolving Turbulent Magnetohydrodynamics: A Hybrid Operator-Diffusion Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.</description>

      <title>Is the hyperscaling relation violated below the upper critical dimension in some particular cases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we show our results with new interpretation on the critical exponents of thin films obtained by high-performance multi-histogram Monte Carlo simulations. The film thickness $N_z$ consists of a few layers up to a dozen of layers in the $z$ direction. The free boundary condition is applied in this direction while in the $xy$ plane periodic boundary conditions are used. Large $xy$ plane sizes are used for finite-size scaling. The Ising model is studied with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction. When $N_z=1$, namely the two-dimensional (2D) system, we find the critical exponents given by the renormalization group. While, for $N_z&gt;1$, the critical exponents calculated with the high-precision multi-histogram technique show that they deviate slightly but systematically from the 2D values. If we use these values of critical exponents in the hyperscaling relation with $d=2$, then the hyperscaling relation is violated. However, if we use the hyperscaling relation and the critical exponents obtained for $N_z&gt;1$ to calculate the dimension of the system, we find the system dimension slightly larger than 2. This can be viewed as an "effective" dimension. More discussion is given in the paper. We also show the cross-over between the first- and second-order transition while varying the film thickness in an antiferromagnetic FCC Ising frustrated thin film. In addition, we will show evidence that when a 2D system has two order parameters of different symmetries with a single transition, the critical exponents are new, suggesting a universality class of coupled two-symmetry breakings. In this case, the 2D hyperscaling does not hold. Another case is the 3D Ising model coupled to the lattice vibration: the critical exponents deviate from the 3D Ising ones, the results suggest the violation of the hyperscaling.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB temperature power spectrum, and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables bidirectional mapping between parameters and acoustic peak features. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves an accuracy of $0.03\%$over $\ell \leq 2510$, while PolyCAMB-peak also reaches sub-percent accuracy and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Corrugated Boards: A New FEM Modeling and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a simplified FEM modeling approach suitable for large structures made of corrugated boards, such as customized packages, based on a homogenization method, which is combined with correction factors for internal mechanisms. The homogenization process reduces computational time by transforming flute geometries into equivalent elastic models. In large deformations and in the presence of contact for a given geometry, the effective elastic modulus in the thickness direction, as well as the effective thickness of the structure, are corrected by two statistical Weibull distributions representing the contact and buckling mechanisms in a corrugated board. The Weibull parameters are obtained via experimental analysis, and such a process is then validated. The results demonstrate that the statistical parameters ($\beta_1 = 0.14$, $\beta_2 = 1.31$) can be used for the simplistic representation of corrugated boards, being computationally efficient. This research contributes to the optimization of corrugated packaging design, specifically by simplifying FEM models for faster yet equally accurate simulations.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effective Elastic Modulus and Thickness of Corrugated Boards Using Gaussian Process Regression and Expected Hypervolume Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to model the hypersurface of the effective elastic modulus, \( E_{z, \text{eff}} \), and thickness, \( th_{\text{eff}} \), in corrugated boards. A Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is followed by Gaussian Process Regression (GP), enhanced by EHVI as a multi-objective acquisition function. Accurate modeling of \( E_{z, \text{eff}} \) and \( th_{\text{eff}} \) is critical for optimizing the mechanical properties of corrugated materials in engineering applications. LHS provides an efficient and straightforward approach for an initial sampling of the input space; GP is expected to be able to adapt to the complexity of the response surfaces by incorporating both prediction and uncertainty. Therefore, the next points being generated and evaluated are based on the complexity of the hypersurfaces, and some points, especially those with higher variance, are more exploited and carry more importance. The performance of GP with EHVI is measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE). Prediction of GP resulted in \( \text{MSE}(E_{z, \text{eff}}) = 5.24 \, \text{kPa}^2 \) and \( \text{MSE}(th_{\text{eff}}) = 1 \, \text{mm}^2 \). GP possesses then improved accuracy and adaptability for future applications in structural optimization.</description>

      <title>Dilution, Diffusion and Symbiosis in Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting, different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.</description>

      <title>Predicting Flow-Induced Vibration in Isolated and Tandem Cylinders Using Hypergraph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a finite element-inspired hypergraph neural network framework for predicting flow-induced vibrations in freely oscillating cylinders. The surrogate architecture transforms unstructured computational meshes into node-element hypergraphs that encode higher-order spatial relationships through element-based connectivity, preserving the geometric and topological structure of the underlying finite-element discretization. The temporal evolution of the fluid-structure interaction is modeled via a modular partitioned architecture: a complex-valued, proper orthogonal decomposition-based sub-network predicts mesh deformation using a low-rank representation of Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) grid displacements, while a hypergraph-based message-passing network predicts the unsteady flow field using geometry-aware node, element, and hybrid edge features. High-fidelity ALE-based simulations provide training and evaluation data across a range of Reynolds numbers and reduced velocities for isolated and tandem cylinder configurations. The framework demonstrates stable roll-outs and accurately captures the nonlinear variation of oscillation amplitudes with respect to reduced velocity, a key challenge in surrogate modeling of flow-induced vibrations. In the tandem configuration, the model successfully resolves complex wake-body interactions and multi-scale coupling effects, enabling accurate prediction of pressure and velocity fields under strong wake interference conditions. Our results show high fidelity in reproducing force statistics, dominant frequencies, and flow-field dynamics, supporting the framework's potential as a robust surrogate model for digital twin applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal boron-doped graphene substrate for glucose Raman signal enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and selective technique that greatly enhances the signal of an analyte, compared with its signal from classical Raman Spectroscopy, due to its interaction with a substrates surface. It has been shown that low concentration boron-doped graphene (B-graphene) enhances the Raman signal of simple organic molecules like pyridine. Recent studies also suggest that B-graphene can remain thermodynamically stable when doped with significantly higher concentrations of boron than previously observed. In this framework, we use quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the influence of dopant concentration and geometric distribution on the effectiveness of B-doped graphene as a SERS substrate, with glucose as analyte. By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of phonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations provide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule orientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman response. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a potential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used phonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising candidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.</description>

      <title>Spin Caloritronics in irradiated chiral ferromagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit (FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing HPC cluster sizes and large-scale simulations that produce petabytes of data per run, create massive IO and storage challenges for analysis. Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages, freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU) simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady process in a continual manner. We detail challenges addressed while porting and scaling to Frontier exascale system.</description>

      <title>Nine circles of elastic brittle fracture: A series of challenge problems to assess fracture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the turn of the millennium, capitalizing on modern advances in mathematics and computation, a slew of computational models have been proposed in the literature with the objective of describing the nucleation and propagation of fracture in materials subjected to mechanical, thermal, and/or other types of loads. By and large, each new proposal focuses on a particular aspect of the problem, while ignoring others that have been well-established. This approach has resulted in a plethora of models that are, at best, descriptors of fracture only under a restricted set of conditions, while they may predict grossly incorrect and even non-physical behaviors in general. In an attempt to address this predicament, this paper introduces a vetting process in the form of nine challenge problems that any computational model of fracture must convincingly handle if it is to potentially describe fracture nucleation and propagation in general. The focus is on the most basic of settings, that of isotropic elastic brittle materials subjected to quasi-static mechanical loads. The challenge problems have been carefully selected so that: $i$) they can be carried out experimentally with standard testing equipment; $ii$) they can be unambiguously analyzed with a sharp description of fracture; and, most critically, $iii$) in aggregate they span the entire range of well settled experimental knowledge on fracture nucleation and propagation that has been amassed for over a century. For demonstration purposes, after their introduction, each challenge problem is solved with two phase-field models of fracture.</description>

      <title>Flowy: High performance probabilistic lava emplacement prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lava emplacement is a complex physical phenomenon, affected by several factors. These include, but are not limited to features of the terrain, the lava settling process, the effusion rate or total erupted volume, and the probability of effusion from different locations. One method, which has been successfully employed to predict lava flow emplacement and forecast the inundated area and final lava thickness, is the MrLavaLoba method from Vitturi et al. The MrLavaLoba method has been implemented in their code of the same name. Here, we introduce Flowy, a new computational tool that implements the MrLavaLoba method in a more efficient manner. New fast algorithms have been incorporated for all performance critical code paths, resulting in a complete overhaul of the implementation. When compared to the MrLavaLoba code, Flowy exhibits a significant reduction in runtime -- between 100 to 400 times faster -- depending on the specific input parameters. The accuracy and the probabilistic convergence of the model outputs are not compromised, maintaining high fidelity in generating possible lava flow paths and deposition characteristics. We have validated Flowy's performance and reliability through comprehensive unit-testing and a real-world eruption scenario. The source code is freely available on GitHub, facilitating transparency, reproducibility and collaboration within the geoscientific community.</description>

      <title>WaterLily.jl: A differentiable and backend-agnostic Julia solver for incompressible viscous flow around dynamic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers into optimization and machine-learning frameworks is hampered by the rigidity of classic computational languages and the slow performance of more flexible high-level languages. In this work, we introduce WaterLily.jl: an open-source incompressible viscous flow solver written in the Julia language. An immersed boundary method is used to enforce the effect of solid boundaries on flow past complex geometries with arbitrary motions. The small code base is multidimensional, multiplatform and backend-agnostic, ie. it supports serial and multithreaded CPU execution, and GPUs of different vendors. Additionally, the pure-Julia implementation allows the solver to be fully differentiable using automatic differentiation. The computational cost per time step and grid point remains constant with increasing grid size on CPU backends, and we measure up to two orders of magnitude speed-up on a supercomputer GPU compared to serial CPU execution. This leads to comparable performance with low-level CFD solvers written in C and Fortran on research-scale problems, opening up exciting possible future applications on the cutting edge of machine-learning research.</description>

Abstract: We present a finite-element software library, IRENE, for numerically solving the steady state and dynamics of a two-dimensional viscous fluid layer embedded in three-dimensional space, on multiple physical scales. The library is designed to handle a wide range of physical regimes -- both low-Reynolds-number and turbulent ones -- and geometries, capturing the coupling between in-plane flows, out-of-plane deformations, surface tension, and elastic response. In addition, the software can treat complex geometries, including those with intra-layer obstacles or arbitrary layer boundaries. We validate IRENE against known analytical and numerical results and demonstrate its capabilities through examples relevant to biological membranes and macroscopic air flows.</description>
