      <title>Deep-learning design of graphene metasurfaces for quantum control and Dirac electron holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are sub-wavelength patterned layers for controlling waves in physical systems. In optics, meta-surfaces are created by materials with different dielectric constants and are capable of unconventional functionalities. We develop a deep-learning framework for Dirac-material metasurface design for controlling electronic waves. The metasurface is a configuration of circular graphene quantum dots, each created by an electric potential. Employing deep convolutional neural networks, we show that the original scattering wave can be reconstructed with fidelity over 95$\%$, suggesting the feasibility of Dirac electron holography. Additional applications such as plane wave generation, designing broadband, and multi-functionality graphene metasurface systems are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Geant4 photonuclear process model for the photo-induced reaction of deformed nuclei in the GDR region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Geant4 photonuclear process is benchmarked by comparing it with experimental data to verify the ability of the Geant4 toolkit to simulate the photo-induced reaction on deformed nuclei in the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) region. The simulation results are compared with experimental data of the deformed nuclei (153Eu, 160Gd, 165Ho, and 186W) targets in terms of both the average neutron energies and the photonuclear cross-sections. The agreement between the calculated results of the Geant4 photonuclear process model and the experimental measurements is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Scalable physical source-to-field inference with hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generative model that amortises computation for the field around e.g. gravitational or magnetic sources. Exact numerical calculation has either computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(M\times{}N)$ in the number of sources and field evaluation points, or requires a fixed evaluation grid to exploit fast Fourier transforms. Using an architecture where a hypernetwork produces an implicit representation of the field around a source collection, our model instead performs as $\mathcal{O}(M + N)$, achieves accuracy of $\sim\!4\%-6\%$, and allows evaluation at arbitrary locations for arbitrary numbers of sources, greatly increasing the speed of e.g. physics simulations. We also examine a model relating to the physical properties of the output field and develop two-dimensional examples to demonstrate its application. The code for these models and experiments is available at https://github.com/cmt-dtu-energy/hypermagnetics.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport of confined water molecules in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensions and molecular structure play pivotal roles in the principle of heat conduction. The dimensional characteristics of solution within nanoscale systems depend on the degrees of confinement. However, the influence of such variations on heat transfer remains inadequately understood. Here, we perform quasi-one-dimensional non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the thermal conductivity of water molecules confined in carbon nanotubes. The structure of water molecules is determined depending on the nanotube radius, forming a single-file, a single-layer, and a double-layer structure, corresponding to an increasing radius order. We reveal that the thermal conductivity of liquid water has a sublinear dependency on nanotube length exclusively when water molecules form a single file. Stronger confinement leads to behavioral and structural characteristics closely resembling a one-dimensional nature. Moreover, single-layer-structured water molecules exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity. We elucidate that this is due to the increase in the local water density and the absence of transitions to another layer, which typically occurs in systems with double-layer water structures within relatively large radius nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Optimal schedules for annealing algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Annealing algorithms such as simulated annealing and population annealing are widely used both for sampling the Gibbs distribution and solving optimization problems (i.e. finding ground states). For both statistical mechanics and optimization, additional parameters beyond temperature are often needed such as chemical potentials, external fields or Lagrange multipliers enforcing constraints. In this paper we derive a formalism for optimal annealing schedules in multidimensional parameter spaces using methods from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The results are closely related to work on optimal control of thermodynamic systems [Sivak and Crooks, PRL 108, 190602 (2012)]. Within the formalism, we compare the efficiency of population annealing and multiple weighted runs of simulated annealing ("annealed importance sampling") and discuss the effects of non-ergodicity on both algorithms. Theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations of spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Better Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers by combining the Unitary Block Optimization Scheme with Classical Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>
