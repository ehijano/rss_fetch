      <title>Differentiability and Optimization of Multiparameter Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-valued functions on geometric data -- such as node attributes on a graph -- can be optimized using descriptors from persistent homology, allowing the user to incorporate topological terms in the loss function. When optimizing a single real-valued function (the one-parameter setting), there is a canonical choice of descriptor for persistent homology: the barcode. The operation mapping a real-valued function to its barcode is differentiable almost everywhere, and the convergence of gradient descent for losses using barcodes is relatively well understood. When optimizing a vector-valued function (the multiparameter setting), there is no unique choice of descriptor for multiparameter persistent homology, and many distinct descriptors have been proposed. This calls for the development of a general framework for differentiability and optimization that applies to a wide range of multiparameter homological descriptors. In this article, we develop such a framework and show that it encompasses well-known descriptors of different flavors, such as signed barcodes and the multiparameter persistence landscape. We complement the theory with numerical experiments supporting the idea that optimizing multiparameter homological descriptors can lead to improved performances compared to optimizing one-parameter descriptors, even when using the simplest and most efficiently computable multiparameter descriptors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.01977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a self contained proof of a result of Dudley [Dud64]} which shows that a bounded convex-body in $\Re^d$ can be $\varepsilon$-approximated, by the intersection of $O_d\bigl(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)/2} \bigr)$ halfspaces, where $O_d$ hides constants that depends on $d$.</description>

      <title>Localization with Single or Antipodal Distance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a polygonal workspace $W$, a depth sensor placed at point $p=(x,y)$ inside $W$ and oriented in direction $\theta$ measures the distance $d=h(x,y,\theta)$ between $p$ and the closest point on the boundary of $W$ along a ray emanating from $p$ in direction $\theta$. We study the following problem: For a polygon $W$ with $n$ vertices, possibly with holes, preprocess it such that given a query real value $d&gt; 0$, one can efficiently compute the preimage $h^{-1}(d) \subset W\times \mathbb{S}^1$, namely determine all the possible poses (positions and orientations) of a depth sensor placed in $W$ that would yield the reading $d$, in an output-sensitive fashion. We describe such an output-sensitive data structure, which answers queries in $O(k \log n)$ time, where $k$ is the number of vertices and maximal arcs of low degree algebraic curves constituting the answer. We also obtain analogous results for the more useful case (narrowing down the set of possible poses), where the sensor performs two antipodal depth measurements from the same point in $W$. We then describe simpler data structures for the same two problems, where we employ a decomposition of $W\times \mathbb{S}^1$, and where the query time is output-sensitive relative to this decomposition. Our software implementation for these latter structures is open source and publicly available. Although robot localization is often carried out by exploring the full visibility polygon of a sensor placed at a point of the environment, the approach that we propose here opens the door to sufficing with only few depth measurements, which is advantageous as it allows for usage of inexpensive sensors and could also lead to savings in storage and communication costs.</description>

      <title>Realizability of Rectangular Euler Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euler diagrams are a tool for the graphical representation of set relations. Due to their simple way of visualizing elements in the sets by geometric containment, they are easily readable by an inexperienced reader. Euler diagrams where the sets are visualized as aligned rectangles are of special interest. In this work, we link the existence of such rectangular Euler diagrams to the order dimension of an associated order relation. For this, we consider Euler diagrams in one and two dimensions. In the one-dimensional case, this correspondence provides us with a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Euler diagrams, while the two-dimensional case is linked to an NP-complete problem which we approach with an exponential-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>A canonical tree decomposition for order types, and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a notion of decomposition of planar point sets (or rather of their chirotopes) as trees decorated by smaller chirotopes. This decomposition is based on the concept of mutually avoiding sets (which we rephrase as \emph{modules}), and adapts in some sense the modular decomposition of graphs in the world of chirotopes. The associated tree always exists and is unique up to some appropriate constraints. We also show how to compute the number of triangulations of a chirotope efficiently, starting from its tree and the (weighted) numbers of triangulations of its parts.</description>
