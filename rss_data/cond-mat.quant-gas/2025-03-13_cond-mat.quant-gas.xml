      <title>Observation of Fermi acceleration with cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as ``Fermi acceleration", in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is however universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize the first fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 um in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above half a meter per second. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics with cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena such as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation and virtually no upper limit.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</description>

      <title>Quantifying two-mode entanglement of bosonic Gaussian states from their full counting statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states from their multi-mode counting statistics. We introduce the idea that measuring high-order correlations of particle numbers can reveal entanglement without making any assumptions about the coherence of the fields. In particular, we show that the two- and four-body number correlations are sufficient to fully characterize the entanglement of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states for which each mode exhibits a thermal distribution. In addition, we derive an entanglement witness based on two-body correlations alone. Our findings are of great importance because it becomes possible to reveal entanglement in a series of recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity altermagnetism through sublattice currents: From Haldane-Hubbard model to general bipartite lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in nonmagnetic crystal structures and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.</description>

      <title>Persistent, controllable circulation of a polariton ring condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07803v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent circulation is a canonical effect of superfluidity. In previous experiments, quantized circulation has been observed in polariton condensates, usually far from equilibrium, but persistent current in the absence of any stirring has not been seen. We report here the direct observation of persistent circulation of a polariton condensate with no driving force and with no observable change in time. We can cause the condensate to circulate in either direction on demand using a short laser pulse, after which the condensate continues to circulate for dozens to hundreds of rotations around a ring trap without any further stimulation. Our theoretical model successfully shows how the pulse, despite not carrying any angular momentum, causes the circulation.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum properties of black holes with a Floquet-driven optical lattice simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Dynamically emergent correlations in bosons via quantum resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) induced by quantum resetting of a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap. Our protocol consists of preparing initially the system in the ground state of a harmonic oscillator centered at $+a$, followed by a rapid quench where the center is shifted to $-a$ and the system is allowed to evolve unitarily up to a random Poissonian time $\tau$ distributed via $r\, e^{-r \tau}$. Then the trap center is reset to $+a$ again and the system is assumed to cool instantaneously to the initial ground state. The system is again allowed to evolve unitarily in the trap centered at $-a$ up to a random time, and the procedure is repeated. Under repeated resetting, the system reaches a NESS where the positions of bosons get strongly correlated due to simultaneous resetting induced by the trap. We fully characterize the steady state by analytically computing several physical observables such as the average density, extreme value statistics, order and gap statistics, and also the distribution of the number of particles in a region $[-L,L]$, known as the full counting statistics (FCS). In particular, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the scaling function describing the FCS exhibits a striking feature: it is supported over a nontrivial finite interval, and moreover is discontinuous at an interior point of the support. Our results are supported by numerical simulations. This is a rare example of a strongly correlated quantum many-body NESS where various observables can be exactly computed.</description>

      <title>Two-spinon effects on the thermal Tonks-Girardeau gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas at thermal equilibrium. Recently, such excitations were investigated for the ground state of the system, and discovered that they prevail for evaluating the one-body correlation function of the infinitely repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. Here we extend it for finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>
