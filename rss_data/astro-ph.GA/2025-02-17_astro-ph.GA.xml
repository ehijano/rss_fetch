      <title>MeerKAT view of Hickson Compact Groups:I. Data description and release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) are dense gravitationally-bound collections of 4-10 galaxies ideal for studying gas and star formation quenching processes. Aims: We aim to understand the transition of HCGs from possessing complex HI tidal structures (so-called phase 2 groups) to a phase where galaxies have lost most or all their HI (phase 3). We also seek to detect diffuse H i gas that was previously missed by the Very Large Array (VLA). Methods: We observed three phase 2 and three phase 3 HCGs with MeerKAT and reduced the data using the Containerized Automated Radio Astronomy Calibration (CARACal) pipeline. We produced data cubes, moment maps, integrated spectra, and compared our findings with previous VLA and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations. Results: Compared with previous VLA observations, MeerKAT reveals much more extended tidal features in phase 2 and some new high surface brightness features in phase 3 groups. However, no diffuse HI component was found in phase 3 groups. We also detected many surrounding galaxies for both phase 2 and phase 3 groups, most of which are normal disk galaxies. Conclusions: The difference between phase 2 and phase 3 groups is still substantial, supporting previous findings that the transition between the two phases must be abrupt.</description>

      <title>Tracing high-z Galaxies in X-rays with JWST and Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &lt; z &lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2$\sigma$ with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.</description>

      <title>SDSS-IV MaStar: Quantification and Abatement of Interstellar Absorption in the Largest Empirical Stellar Spectral Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the impact of CaII 3934,3969 and NaI 5891,5897 absorption arising in the interstellar medium (ISM) on the SDSS-IV MaNGA Stellar Library (MaStar) and produce corrected spectroscopy for 80% of the 24,162-star catalog. We model the absorption strength of these transitions as a function of stellar distance, Galactic latitude, and dust reddening based upon high-spectral resolution studies. With this model, we identify 6342 MaStar stars that have negligible ISM absorption ($W^\mathrm{ISM}$(CaII K) $&lt;0.07$ Ang and $W^\mathrm{ISM}$(NaI 5891) $&lt;0.05$ Ang). For 12,110 of the remaining stars, we replace their NaI D profile (and their CaII profile for effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}&gt;9000$ K) with a coadded spectrum of low-ISM stars with similar $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity, and metallicity. For 738 additional stars with $T_{\rm eff}&gt;9000$ K, we replace these spectral regions with a matching ATLAS9-based BOSZ model. This results in a mean reduction in $W$(CaII K) ($W$(NaI D)) of $0.4-0.7$ Ang ($0.6-1.1$ Ang) for hot stars ($T_{\rm eff}&gt;7610$ K), and a mean reduction in $W$(NaI D) of $0.1-0.2$ Ang for cooler stars. We show that interstellar absorption in simple stellar population (SSP) model spectra constructed from the original library artificially enhances $W$(CaII K) by $\gtrsim20\%$ at young ages ($&lt;400$ Myr); dramatically enhances the strength of stellar NaI D in starbursting systems (by ${\gtrsim}50\%$); and enhances stellar NaI D in older stellar populations (${\gtrsim}10$ Gyr) by ${\gtrsim}10\%$. We provide SSP spectra constructed from the cleaned library, and discuss the implications of these effects for stellar population synthesis analyses constraining stellar age, [Na/Fe] abundance, and the initial mass function.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey: XXVIII. The extremely metal-poor stream C-19 stretches over more than 100 degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the most metal-poor stream, C-19, provides us with a fossil record of a stellar structure born very soon after the Big Bang. In this work, we search for new C-19 members over the whole sky by combining two complementary stream-searching algorithms, STREAMFINDER and StarGO,, and utilizing low-metallicity star samples from the Pristine survey as well as Gaia BP/RP spectro-photometric catalogues. We confirm twelve new members, spread over more than 100$^\circ$, using velocity and metallicity information from a set of spectroscopic follow-up programs that targeted a quasi-complete sample of our bright candidates ($G \lesssim 16.0$). From the updated set of stream members, we confirm that the stream is wide, with a stream width of $\sim200$ pc, and dynamically hot, with a derived velocity dispersion of $11.1^{+1.9}_{-1.6}$ km/s. The tension remains between these quantities and a purely baryonic scenario in which the relatively low-mass stream (even updated to a few $10^4M_{\odot}$) stems from a globular cluster progenitor, as suggested by its chemical abundances. Some heating mechanism, such as preheating of the cluster in its own dark matter halo or through interactions with halo sub-structures appears necessary to explain the tension. The impact of binaries on the measured dispersion also remains unknown. Detailed elemental abundances of more stream members as well as multi-epoch radial velocities from spectroscopic observations are therefore crucial to fully understand the nature and past history of the most metal-poor stream of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The Bullseye: HST, Keck/KCWI, and Dragonfly Characterization of a Giant Nine-Ringed Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and multiwavelength followup of LEDA 1313424 ("Bullseye"), a collisional ring galaxy (CRG) with nine readily-identified rings -- the most so far reported for a CRG. These data shed new light on the rapid, multi-ring phase of CRG evolution. Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we identify and measure nine ring structures, several of which are "piled up" near the center of the galaxy, while others extend to tens of kpc scales. We also identify faint patches of emission at large radii ($\sim$70 kpc) in the HST imaging, and confirm the association of this emission with the galaxy via spectroscopy. Deep ground based imaging using the Dragonfly Telephoto Array finds evidence that this patch of emission is part of an older, fading ring from the collision. We find that the locations of the detected rings are an excellent match to predictions from analytic theory, if the galaxy was a 10-ring system whose outermost ring has faded away. We identify the likely impacting galaxy via Keck/KCWI spectroscopy, finding evidence for gas extending between it and the Bullseye. The overall size of this galaxy rivals that of known Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (GLSBs) such as Malin I, lending credence to the hypothesis that CRGs can evolve into GLSBs as their rings expand and fade. Analysis of the HI content in this galaxy from ALFALFA finds significantly elevated neutral hydrogen with respect to the galaxy's stellar mass, another feature in alignment with GLSB systems.</description>

      <title>Deep in the Fields of the Andromeda Halo: Discovery of the Pegasus VII dwarf galaxy in UNIONS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the newly discovered dwarf galaxy Pegasus VII (Peg VII), a member of the M31 sub-group which has been uncovered in the $ri$ photometric catalogs from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey and confirmed with follow-up imaging from both the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Gemini-North Telescope. This system has an absolute $V$-band magnitude of $-5.7 \pm 0.2$ mag and a physical half-light radius of $177^{+36}_{-34}$ pc, which is characteristic of dynamically-confirmed Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxies and about 5 times more extended than the most extended M31 globular clusters. Peg VII lies at a three-dimensional separation from M31 of $331^{+15}_{-4}$ kpc and a significant elongation ($\epsilon \sim 0.5$) towards the projected direction of M31 could be indicative of a past tidal interaction, but additional investigation into the orbit, star formation history, and whether any gas remains in the galaxy is needed to better understand the evolution of Peg VII.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Finding strong gravitational lenses in the Early Release Observations using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Early Release Observations (ERO) from Euclid have detected several new galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses, with the all-sky survey expected to find 170,000 new systems, greatly enhancing studies of dark matter, dark energy, and constraints on the cosmological parameters. As a first step, visual inspection of all galaxies in one of the ERO fields (Perseus) was carried out to identify candidate strong lensing systems and compared to the predictions from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, the entire ERO data set is too large for expert visual inspection. In this paper, we therefore extend the CNN analysis to the whole ERO data set, using different CNN architectures and methodologies. Using five CNN architectures, we identified 8,469 strong gravitational lens candidates from IE-band cutouts of 13 Euclid ERO fields, narrowing them to 97 through visual inspection, including 14 grade A and 31 grade B candidates. We present the spectroscopic confirmation of a strong gravitational lensing candidate, EUCLJ081705.61+702348.8. The foreground lensing galaxy, an early-type system at redshift z = 0.335, and the background source, a star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 1.475 with [O II] emission, are both identified. Lens modeling using the Euclid strong lens modeling pipeline reveals two distinct arcs in a lensing configuration, with an Einstein radius of 1.18 \pm 0.03 arcseconds, confirming the lensing nature of the system. These findings highlight the importance of a broad CNN search to efficiently reduce candidates, followed by visual inspection to eliminate false positives and achieve a high-purity sample of strong lenses in Euclid.</description>

      <title>$R_V$ from multi-waveband galaxy polarimetry in supernovae vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peculiar dust extinction laws have been reported for some type Ia supernovae (SNe) with the parameter $R_V$ much lower than the average value for the Milky Way (MW) of 3.1. Using optical photopolarimetry of supernova (SN) host galaxies, a few years after the explosion, we estimate $R_V$ in the vicinity of each SN and compare it with the extinction law calculated directly from SN observations. Multiband photopolarimetric data of nine galaxies, hosts of eleven SNe, acquired with VLT-FORS2 in IPOL mode, are used to map the polarization angle and the polarization degree in each galaxy. Data are processed with a custom-built reduction pipeline that corrects for instrumental, background, and MW interstellar polarization effects. The validity of Serkowski relations is tested at different locations in the galaxy to extract the wavelength of the maximum polarization {\lambda}max and obtain 2D maps for RV . When the fit to {\lambda}max at the SN location is poor, or impossible, an approximate Bayesian spatial inference method is employed to obtain an estimate of {\lambda}max using well-fitted neighboring locations. The estimated local $R_V$ for each SN is compared with published values from the SN light curves. We find $R_V$ values from optical photopolarimetry at SNe locations consistent with the average MW value and a median difference of &gt; 3{\sigma} with the low peculiar $R_V$ obtained from the analysis of some reddened SN Ia light curves. The $R_V$ estimates obtained with BVRI photopolarimetry for the SNe vicinity are statistically similar to the hosts global $R_V$. Conclusions. The discrepancy between the local $R_V$, inferred from photopolarimetry in the SN vicinity, and RV obtained from SNe light curves suggests that the extinction laws obtained directly from the SNe may be driven by more local effects, perhaps from the interaction of light from the SN with very nearby material.</description>

      <title>Structure of gaps induced by retrograde satellites embedded in accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 2D simulations, we investigate how a non-accreting satellite on a fixed retrograde circular orbit affects the structure of the accretion disc in which it is embedded. We vary the satellite-to-primary mass ratio $q$, the disc viscosity $\nu$, and the inner boundary conditions. A viscous criterion for gap opening is derived, which is broadly consistent with the simulations. We find a scaling relation of the gap depth with $q$ and $\nu$. Unlike the prograde case, the satellite is located at the gap's inner edge, resulting in a surface density at the satellite's orbital radius up to $20$ times higher than at the gap's minimum. As the viscosity decreases, the gap depth increases, while the radial shift of the gap and the satellite's orbital radius decreases. Gap-opening satellites may drive radial motions in the disc, producing eccentric gaps. Positioned at the gap edge, satellites experience a rapidly fluctuating environment. Migrating satellites can develop orbital eccentricities comparable to the disc's aspect ratio. In a 3D simulation with $q=0.01$, the flow velocity exhibits a notorious vertical component in the gap's inner edge. A comparison between 2D and 3D simulations reveals a slight radial offset in gap position, resulting in a lower surface density at the perturber's orbital radius in the 3D simulation.</description>

      <title>A MaNGA view of isolated galaxy mergers in the star-forming Main Sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we carry out an analysis of star-formation and nuclear activity in the different stages during a galaxy merger identified in isolated systems (isolated galaxies, isolated pairs, and isolated triplets) using integral field spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA project. We classify galaxies into close pairs, pre-mergers, mergers, and post-mergers (including galaxies with post-starburst spectroscopic features), for a total sample of 137 galaxies. We constrained their star formation history from spectro- photometric SED fitting with CIGALE, and used spatially resolved WHAN diagrams, with other MaNGA data products to explore if there is any connection of their physical properties with their merging stage. In general, galaxies show characteristic properties intrinsically related to each stage of the merger process. Galaxies in the merger and post-merger stages present higher star formation activity (measured by their integrated sSFR). In the merger stage, the fraction of strong AGN spaxels is comparable to the fraction of spaxels with pure star-formation emission, with no difference between AGN activity in close pairs and strongly interacting galaxies with the same stellar mass. Our results support the scenario where galaxy interactions trigger star-formation and nuclear activity on galaxies. Nonetheless, AGN has a minor role in quenching galaxies following a merger, as AGN feedback might not have had sufficient time to inhibit star formation. In addition, we found that the quenching process in post-mergers galaxies with post-starburst emission is happening outside-in, being an observational proof of the effect of interactions on the quenching process. The transforming processes after a recent major galaxy interaction may happen slowly on isolated environments, where the system evolves in a common dark matter halo without any perturbation of external galaxies.</description>

      <title>Modelling methanol and hydride formation in the JWST Ice Age era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) JWST observations have measured the ice composition toward two highly-extinguished field stars in the Chamaeleon I cloud. The observed extinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron has been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests that CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO depletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in water-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out thus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code employed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of astrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations) to test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice chemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced for gas densities &gt;1e5 cm-3 and collapse times &gt;1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms predominantly (&gt;99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH and C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O depending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are efficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is largely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher amount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase. Large differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust&lt;12 K between diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that non-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust. This could explain the rather constant ice chemical composition found in Chamaeleon I and other dense cores despite the different visual extinctions probed.</description>

      <title>MICONIC: JWST Unveils Shocked Hot Core Chemistry in the Western Nucleus of Arp 220</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present full 3-28 micron JWST MIRI/MRS and NIRSpec/IFU spectra of the western nucleus of Arp 220, the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy. This nucleus has long been suggested to possibly host an embedded Compton-thick AGN. Millimeter observations of the dust continuum suggest the presence of a distinct 20 pc core with a dust temperature of $T_\mathrm{d} \gtrsim 500~\mathrm{K}$, in addition to a 100 pc circumnuclear starburst disk. However, unambiguously identifying the nature of this core is challenging, due to the immense obscuration, the nuclear starburst activity, and the nearby eastern nucleus. With the JWST integral field spectrographs, we can, for the first time, separate the two nuclei across this full wavelength range, revealing a wealth of molecular absorption features towards the western nucleus. We analyse the rovibrational bands detected at 4-22 micron, deriving column densities and rotational temperatures for 10 distinct species. Optically thick features of C$_2$H$_2$, HCN and HNC suggest that this molecular gas is hidden behind a curtain of cooler dust, and indicate that the column densities of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN are an order of magnitude higher than previously derived from Spitzer observations. We identify a warm HCN component with rotational temperature $T_\mathrm{rot} = 330~\mathrm{K}$, which we associate with radiative excitation by the hot inner nucleus. We propose a geometry where the detected molecular gas is located in the inner regions of the starburst disk, directly surrounding the hot 20 parsec core. The chemical footprint of the western nucleus is reminiscent of that of hot cores, with additional evidence for shocks. No evidence for the presence of an AGN in the form of X-ray-driven chemistry or extreme excitation is found.</description>

      <title>The impact of medium-width bands on the selection, and subsequent luminosity function measurements, of high-z galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New, ultra-deep medium-width photometric coverage with JWST's NIRCam instrument provides the potential for much improved photo-z reliability at high redshifts. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the JADES Origins Field, which contains 14 broad- and medium-width near-infrared bands, to assess the benefits of medium band photometry on high-z sample completeness and contamination rates. Using imaging with depths of AB mag $29.8-30.35$, we conduct an experiment to observe how high-z selections differ when images are artificially degraded or bands are removed. In parallel, the same experiments are conducted on simulated catalogues from the JAGUAR semi-analytic model to examine if the behaviour from observations can be replicated. We find sample completeness is high ($80\%+$) and contamination low ($&lt;4\%$) when in the $10\sigma+$ regime, even without the use of any medium-width bands. The addition of medium-width bands leads to notable increases in completeness ($\sim10\%$) but multiple bands are required to improve contamination rates due to the small redshift ranges over which they probe strong emission lines. Incidents of Balmer-Lyman degeneracy increase in the $5-7\sigma$ regime and this can be replicated in both simulated catalogues and degraded real data. We measure the faint-end of the UV LF at $8.5&lt;z&lt;13.5$, finding high number densities that agree with previous JWST observations. Overall, medium bands are effective at increasing completeness and reducing contamination, but investment in achieving at least comparable depths in the blue ($&lt;1.5\mu$m) as achieved in the red is also found to be key to fully reducing contamination from high-z samples.</description>

      <title>Early Galaxies from Rare Inflationary Processes and JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare Poisson processes (PP) during cosmic inflation can lead to signatures that are localized in position space and are not well captured by the standard two- or higher-point correlation functions of primordial density perturbations. As an example, PP can lead to localized overdense regions that are far denser than the ones produced through standard inflationary fluctuations. As a result, such overdense regions collapse earlier than expected based on the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and would host anomalously high-redshift galaxies. We describe some general aspects of such PP and consider a particular realization in the context of inflationary particle production. We then show that the masses and redshifts of the resulting galaxies can lie in a range discoverable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and future surveys, while being consistent with existing constraints on the matter power spectrum and UV luminosity functions at lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>The bright, dusty aftermath of giant eruptions &amp; H-rich supernovae. Late interaction of supernova shocks &amp; dusty circumstellar shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late-stage evolution of massive stars is marked by intense instability as they approach core-collapse. During these phases, giant stellar eruptions lead to exceptionally high mass-loss rates, forming significant amounts of dust. However, the survival of these dust grains is challenged by the powerful shock waves generated when the progenitor explodes as a supernova (SN). We explore the impact of hydrogen-rich SN explosions from 45, 50, and 60 M$_\odot$ progenitors on dust formed after these eruptions, focusing on interactions with circumstellar shells occurring from a few years to centuries after the event. Using 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we track the evolution of dust particles in a scenario that includes the progenitor's stellar wind, a giant eruption, and the subsequent SN explosion, following the mass budgets predicted by stellar evolution models. For a standard SN ejecta mass of 10 M$_\odot$ and kinetic energy of $10^{51}$ erg, only 25% of the dust mass survives 250 years post-explosion in a spherical circumstellar medium (CSM), while merely 2% remains a century after the explosion in a bipolar CSM. If the SN follows the eruption within a dozen years, 75% of the dust survives for a standard explosion, dropping to 20% for more massive ejecta (15-20 M$_\odot$) with kinetic energy of $5 \times 10^{51}$ erg. The geometry of the CSM and the early transition of the SN remnant into a radiative phase significantly influence dust survival. As the shock wave weakens and efficiently converts kinetic energy into thermal radiation (up to half of the injected kinetic energy) the likelihood of dust survival increases, affecting not only pre-existing dust in the CSM but also SN-condensed dust and ambient interstellar dust. Contrary to expectations, a larger fraction of the dust mass can survive if the SN occurs only a few years after the eruption.</description>

      <title>Stellar Ages: A Code to Infer Properties of Stellar Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel statistical algorithm, Stellar Ages, which currently infers the age, metallicity, and extinction posterior distributions of stellar populations from their magnitudes. While this paper focuses on these parameters, the framework is readily adaptable to include additional properties, such as rotation, in future work. Historical age-dating techniques either model individual stars or populations of stars, often sacrificing population context or precision for individual estimates. Stellar Ages does both, combining the strengths of these approaches to provide precise individual ages for stars while leveraging population-level constraints. We verify the algorithm's capabilities by determining the age of synthetic stellar populations and actual stellar populations surrounding a nearby supernova, SN 2004dj. In addition to inferring an age, we infer a progenitor mass consistent with direct observations of the precursor star. The median age inferred from the brightest nearby stars is $\log_{10}$(Age/yr) = $7.19^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$, and its corresponding progenitor mass is $13.95^{+3.33}_{-1.96}$ $\text{M}_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Swift-XRT and NuSTAR Monitoring of Obscuration Variability in Mrk 477</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of 15 X-ray observations of Mrk 477, a nearby Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus, with the objective to monitor its obscuring column density variability. The full dataset consists of five archival observations, split into two XMM-Newton, two NuSTAR and one Chandra observation, plus two dedicated monitoring campaigns. The monitoring campaigns were performed with Swift-XRT and NuSTAR, containing five observations each. We performed a simultaneous analysis using self-consistent torus models, deriving geometric properties of the torus as well as the obscuration along the line of sight. Mrk 477 is best modeled with a torus with large covering factor yet low column density (on average). Its line of sight column density oscillates between $1.5-7\times10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$. Mrk~477 presents frequent obscuring column density variability, on timescales as short as $\sim2$~weeks. The probability of drawing a pair of obscuration-variable observations for Mrk~477 when having 2, 3, and 4 observations is 40\%, 78\% and 95\%, respectively. Adding the results of this work to those of another 26 sources, we find a trend of increasing obscuration variability with time (from $\sim20$\% at $\Delta t&lt;10$~days, to $\sim60-70$\% at timescales larger than 5 years). We discuss whether this is compatible with the majority of obscuration variability coming from broad line region clouds.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Fast Image Simulation Technique with Spatially Variable Point Spread Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulated images are essential in algorithm development and instrument testing for optical telescopes. During real observations, images obtained by optical telescopes are affected by spatially variable point spread functions (PSFs), a crucial effect requiring accurate simulation. Traditional methods segment images into patches, convolve patches with individual PSFs, and reassemble them as a whole image. Although widely used, these approaches suffer from slow convolution processes and reduced image fidelity due to abrupt PSF transitions between different patches. This paper introduces a novel method for generating simulated images with spatial continuously varying PSFs. Our approach firstly decomposes original images into PSF bases derived with the principal component analysis method. The entire image is then convolved with these PSF bases to create image bases. Finally, we multiply the coefficients of image bases with these image bases for each pixels and add the multiplication results along each pixel to obtain the final simulated image. Our method could generate high-fidelity simulated images with spatially variable PSFs without boundary artifacts. The method proposed in this paper significantly improves the speed of astronomical image simulation, potentially advancing observational astronomy and instrumental development.</description>

      <title>Cl+ and HCl+ in Reaction with H2 and Isotopologues: A Glance into H Abstraction and Indirect Exchange at Astrophysical Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrochemical models of interstellar clouds, the sites of stars, and planet formation require information about spin-state chemistry to allow quantitative comparison with spectroscopic observations. In particular, it is important to know if full scrambling or H abstraction (also known as proton hopping) takes place in ion-neutral reactions. The reaction of Cl+ and HCl+ with H2 and isotopologues has been studied at cryogenic temperatures between 20 and 180 K using a 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. Isotopic exchange processes are used to probe the reaction mechanism of the HCl+ + H2 reaction. The results are compared with previous measurements and theoretical predictions. The rate coefficients for the Cl+ + H2 and HCl+ + H2 reactions are found to be constant in the range of temperatures studied, except for the DCl+ + D2 reaction, where a weak negative temperature dependence is observed, and reactions with D2 are found to be significantly slower than the Langevin rate. No isotopic exchange reactions are observed to occur for the H2Cl+ ion. The analysis of the products of the HCl+ + H2 isotopic system clearly indicates that the reaction proceeds via simple hydrogen atom abstraction.</description>

      <title>The implications of stochastic gas torques for asymmetric binaries in the LISA band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from asymmetric mass-ratio black-hole binaries carry unique information about their astrophysical environment. For instance, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could potentially measure the amplitude and slope of gas torques in binaries embedded in the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei, helping differentiate competing accretion disk models. However, this relies on simplified analytic models, which do not account for the stochastic variability of torques seen in hydrodynamic simulations. In this work, we use hydrodynamic simulations to create gravitational waveforms for extreme and intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in the LISA band. We then analyze these simulated waveforms using simpler templates that assume analytic torques, without stochastic time variability. By performing realistic Bayesian parameter estimation, we find no bias at 90% confidence in the binary parameters; however, estimates of accretion disk parameters, such as torque amplitude and slope, may be biased. Typically, the posterior distribution is centered around the average value of the torques, but when stochastic variability is large, the posterior can indicate no torques, even though they are present in the simulation. Our results suggest that while simplified analytic torque models work well for estimating binary parameters, caution is needed when using them to infer properties of the accretion disk. This work moves towards a more realistic assessment of one of the LISA science objectives, i.e., probing the properties of the astrophysical environments of black holes.</description>

      <title>CMB lensing tomography with clustering estimation of lens redshift distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a clustering-based redshift estimation approach for CMB lensing tomography, focusing on the kernel function of the lensing galaxies. Within a linear galaxy bias framework, we derive estimators for this kernel from two-point cross-correlations between lens mass and reference samples. The reconstructed kernel then enables a theoretical prediction for the angular cross-power spectrum \(C_{g\kappa}\) between CMB lensing convergence and lens galaxies. As a proof of concept, we measure \(C_{g\kappa}\) by correlating the \emph{Planck} PR4 convergence map with NVSS+SUMSS radio galaxies (\(0\lesssim z\lesssim 3\)). We estimate the radio-galaxy kernel by collectively cross-correlating their distribution with spectroscopic and photometric surveys (2MPZ, LOWZ-CMASS, eBOSS DR16 LRGs, and Gaia-unWISE QSOs). From the measured \(C_{g\kappa}\), we obtain \(\sigma_8 = 0.86^{+0.12}_{-0.09}\) when the density parameter is set to the {\it Planck} value of $\Omega_m = 0.315$; this is in good agreement with the \emph{Planck} normalisation of $\sigma_8 = 0.812$.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Multi-phase analysis of a star-forming galaxy at $z \sim 5.5$</title>

Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]$\lambda$5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Galaxy Stellar Properties on the Primordial Spin Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical discovery that the observable stellar properties of present galaxies retain significant dependences on the primordial density and tidal fields. Analyzing the galaxy catalogs from the TNG300-1 simulations, we first compute the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the mean degree of misalignments between the principal axes of the initial density and potential hessian tensors at the protogalactic sites. Then, we explore in the framework of Shannon's information theory if and how strongly each of six stellar properties of the present galaxies, namely two stellar sizes ($R_{90\star}$ and $R_{50\star}$), ages, specific star formation rates, optical colors and metallicities, share mutual information with $\tau$, measured at $z=127$. Deliberately controlling the TNG galaxy samples to have no differences in the mass, environmental density and shear distributions, we single out net effects of $\tau$ on each of the galaxy stellar properties. In the higher stellar mass range of $M_{\star}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})\ge 10^{10}$, significant amounts of mutual information with $\tau$ are exhibited by all of the six stellar properties, while in the lower range of $M_{\star}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})&lt; 10^{10}$ only four of the six properties except for the specific star formation rates and colors yield significant signals of $\tau$-dependence. Examining how the mean values of the six stellar properties vary with $\tau$, we also show that the galaxies originated from the protogalactic sites with higher $\tau$ values tend to have larger sizes, later formation epochs, higher specific star formation rates, bluer colors and lower metallicities. It is also discovered that the galaxy stellar sizes, which turn out to be most robustly dependent on $\tau$ regardless of $M_{\star}$, follow a bimodal Gamma distribution, the physical implication of which is discussed.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the magnetic field in the thick shell of Galactic bubbles with uniform initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubbles and super-bubbles are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and influence their local magnetic field. Starting from the assumption that bubbles result from violent explosions that sweep matter away in a thick shell, we derive the analytical equations for the divergence-free, regular magnetic field in the shell. The explosion velocity field is assumed to be radial but not necessarily spherical, making it possible to model various-shaped bubbles. Assuming an explosion center, the magnetic field at the present time is fully determined by the initial uniform magnetic field, the present-time geometry of the bubble shell, and a radial vector field that encodes the explosion-induced displacement of matter, from its original location to its present-time location. We present the main characteristics of our magnetic-field model using a simple linear model for the radial displacements. Next, we use our analytical prescription, informed by a three-dimensional dust density map, to estimate the expected contribution of the shell of the Local Bubble, the super-bubbles in which the Sun resides, to the integrated Faraday rotation measures and synchrotron emission and compare these to full-sky observational data. We find that, while the contribution to the former is minimal, the contribution to the latter is very significant at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;45^\circ$. Our results underline the need to take the Local Bubble into account in large-scale Galactic magnetic field studies.</description>

      <title>Combining neural networks with galaxy light subtraction for discovering strong lenses in the HSC SSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses are valuable objects for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications. Strong lensing galaxies are rare, so efficient search methods, such as convolutional neural networks, are often used on large imaging datasets. In this work, we apply a new technique to improve the performance of supervised neural networks by subtracting the central (lensing) galaxy light from both the training and test datasets. We use multiband imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) as our training and test datasets. By subtracting the lensing galaxy light, we increase the contrast of the lensed source compared to the original imaging data. We also apply the light subtraction to non-lenses in order to compare them to the light-subtracted lenses. Residual features resulting from poor light subtraction can adversely affect the performance of networks trained on the subtracted images alone. We find that combining the light-subtracted images with the original gri-band images for training and classification can overcome this and improve the overall classification accuracy. We find the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve can be improved to 0.841 using the combination of the fiducial images and light-subtracted images, compared to 0.808 for the fiducial imaging dataset alone. This may be a promising technique for improving future lens searches using CNNs.</description>

      <title>The MUSE Ultra Deep Field: A 5 Mpc stretch of the z $\approx$ 4 cosmic web revealed in emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from a ~5 Mpc-long (comoving) portion of the cosmic web hosting an overdensity ($\delta \approx 25$) of 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx 4$ within the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF), reaching an average surface brightness (SB) of $5\times 10^{-20}~\rm{erg~s^{-1}~ cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. This large-scale structure has an average SB similar to the filament across the two MUDF quasars at $z\approx 3.22$. However, deep multiwavelength data do not show a clear presence of active galactic nuclei, suggesting that the emission is mainly regulated by the underlying gas density. We find $\approx 0.2$ dex higher star formation compared to control samples and a remarkable predominance (5/7) of blue-peaked emission lines in the spectra of the embedded LAEs, indicative of favorable conditions for gas accretion. Lastly, we quantify the contribution of intragalactic gas to the Ly$\alpha$ SB profile at large distances from LAEs. By studying samples of filaments detected in emission within diverse environments, we are finally gaining new insight into the physics of gas accretion within the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>EPOCHS XI: The Structure and Morphology of Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization to z ~ 12.5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of 521 galaxy candidates at 6.5 &lt; z &lt; 12.5, with $SNR &gt; 10\sigma$ in the F444W filter, taken from the EPOCHS v1 sample, consisting of uniformly reduced deep JWST NIRCam data, covering the CEERS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, SMACS0723, GLASS and PEARLS surveys. We use standard software to fit single S\'ersic models to each galaxy in the rest-frame optical and extract their parametric structural parameters (S\'ersic index, half-light radius and axis-ratio), and \texttt{Morfometryka} to measure their non-parametric concentration and asymmetry parameters. We find a wide range of sizes for these early galaxies, but with a strong galaxy-size mass correlation up to $z \sim 12$ such that galaxy sizes continue to get progressively smaller in the high-redshift regime, following $R_{e} = 2.74 \pm 0.49 \left( 1 + z \right) ^{-0.79 \pm 0.08}$ kpc. Using non-parametric methods we find that galaxy merger fractions, classified through asymmetry parameters, at these redshifts remain consistent with those in literature, maintaining a value of $f_{m} \sim 0.12 \pm 0.07$ showing little dependence with redshift when combined with literature at $z &gt; 4$. We find that galaxies which are smaller in size also appear rounder, with an excess of high axis-ratio objects. Finally, we artificially redshift a subsample of our objects to determine how robust the observational trends we see are, determining that observed trends are due to real evolutionary effects, rather than being a consequence of redshift effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia mission has triggered major developments in the field of Galactic dynamics in recent years, which we discuss in this review. The structure and kinematics of all Galactic components - disc, bar/bulge and halo - are now mapped in great detail not only in the Solar neighbourhood, but across a large part of the Milky Way. The dramatic improvements in the coverage and precision of observations revealed various disequilibrium processes, such as perturbations in the Galactic disc and the deformations of the outer halo, which are partly attributed to the interaction with satellite galaxies. The knowledge of the gravitational potential at all scales has also advanced considerably, but we are still far from having a consistent view on the key properties of the Galaxy, such as the bar pattern speed or the mass profile and shape of the dark halo. The complexity and interplay of several dynamical processes makes the interpretation of observational data challenging, and it is fair to say that more theoretical effort is needed to fully reap the fruit of the Gaia revolution.</description>

      <title>The GALAH survey: Improving chemical abundances using star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large spectroscopic surveys aim to consistently compute stellar parameters of very diverse stars while minimizing systematic errors. We explore the use of stellar clusters as benchmarks to verify the precision of spectroscopic parameters in the 4. data release (DR4) of the GALAH survey. We examine 58 open and globular clusters and associations to validate measurements of temperature, gravity, chemical abundances, and stellar ages. We focus on identifying systematic errors and understanding trends between stellar parameters, particularly temperature and chemical abundances. We identify trends by stacking measurements of chemical abundances against effective temperature and modelling them with splines. We also refit spectra in three clusters with the Spectroscopy Made Easy and Korg packages to reproduce the trends in DR4 and to search for their origin by varying temperature and gravity priors, linelists, and spectral continuum. Trends are consistent between clusters of different ages and metallicities, can reach amplitudes of ~0.5 dex and differ for dwarfs and giants. We use the derived trends to correct the DR4 abundances of 24 and 31 chemical elements for dwarfs and giants, and publish a detrended catalogue. While the origin of the trends could not be pinpointed, we found that: i) photometric priors affect derived abundances, ii) temperature, metallicity, and continuum levels are degenerate in spectral fitting, and it is hard to break the degeneracy even by using independent measurements, iii) the completeness of the linelist used in spectral synthesis is essential for cool stars, and iv) different spectral fitting codes produce significantly different iron abundances for stars of all temperatures. We conclude that clusters can be used to characterise the systematic errors of parameters produced in large surveys, but further research is needed to explain the origin of the trends.</description>

      <title>The [NII] 205 $\mu$m line emission from high-z SMGs and QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present [NII] 205 $\mu$m fine structure line observations of three submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and three quasar host galaxies at 4$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$6 using the Institut de radioastronomie millim\'etrique (IRAM) interferometer. The [NII] emission is detected in three sources, and we report detections of the underlying dust continuum emission in all sources. The observed [NII]-to-infrared luminosity ratio spans at least 0.5 dex for our sources. Comparing our estimates with sources detected in the [NII] 205 $\mu$m at similar redshifts shows that the overall [NII]-to-IR luminosity ratio spans over a dex in magnitude from L$_{[NII]}$/L$_{IR}$ ~ 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-5}$ and follows the trend of the so-called [NII] fine structure line deficit observed in (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies in the local Universe. The [CII]-to-[NII] luminosity ratio is &gt;10 for most of our sources, indicating that the bulk of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line emission (f([CII]$^{PDR}$)&gt;75%) arises from the neutral medium. From our analysis, we do not find significant differences in the [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission and the respective ratios between SMGs and QSOs, suggesting a negligible contribution to the boosting of [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission due to the active galactic nucleus (AGN) photoionization. Future investigations involving other fine structure lines and optical diagnostics will provide further insight into a suite of ionized medium properties and reveal the diversity between AGN and non-AGN environments.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent models of AGN disks with radiation from embedded stellar-mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brightest steady sources of radiation in the universe, active galactic nuclei (AGN), are powered by gas accretion onto a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The large sizes and accretion rates implicated in AGN accretion disks are expected to lead to gravitational instability and fragmentation, effectively cutting off mass inflow to the SMBH. Radiative feedback from disk-embedded stars has been invoked to yield marginally stable, steady-state solutions in the outer disks. Here, we examine the consequences of this star formation with a semi-analytical model in which stellar-mass black hole (sBH) remnants in the disk provide an additional source of stabilizing radiative feedback. Assuming star formation seeds the embedded sBH population, we model the time-evolving feedback from both stars and the growing population of accreting sBHs. We find that in the outer disk, the luminosity of the sBHs quickly dominates that of their parent stars. However, because sBHs consume less gas than stars to stabilize the disk, the presence of the sBHs enhances the mass flux to the inner disk. As a result, star formation persists over the lifetime of the AGN, damped in the outer disk, but amplified in a narrow ring in the inner disk. Heating from the embedded sBHs significantly modifies the disk's temperature profile and hardens its spectral energy distribution, and direct emission from the sBHs adds a new hard X-ray component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the Universe, corresponding to a fraction of $f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10}$ at 90\% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically $f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}$. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least $\sim$$10\%$ of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.</description>

      <title>Comparison of methods used to derive the Galactic star formation history from white dwarf samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare three methods of deriving the local Galactic star formation history, using as a benchmark the Gaia-defined 40 pc white dwarf sample, currently the largest volume complete sample of stellar remnants with medium-resolution spectroscopy. We create a population synthesis model to 1) reproduce the observed white dwarf luminosity function, 2) reproduce the observed absolute Gaia G magnitude distribution, and 3) directly calculate the ages of all individual white dwarfs in the 40 pc volume. We then compare the star formation histories determined from each method. Previous studies using these methods were based on different white dwarf samples and as such were difficult to compare. Uncertainties in each method such as the initial mass function, initial-final mass relation, main sequence lifetimes, stellar metallicity, white dwarf cooling ages and binary evolution are accounted for to estimate the precision and accuracy of each method. We conclude that no method is quantitatively better at determining the star formation history and all three produce star formation histories that agree within uncertainties of current external astrophysical relations.</description>
