      <title>Revisiting the Ratchet Principle: When Hidden Symmetries Prevent Steady Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``ratchet principle", which states that non-equilibrium systems violating parity symmetry generically exhibit steady-state currents, is one of the few generic results outside thermal equilibrium. We study exceptions to this principle observed in active and passive systems with spatially varying fluctuations sources. For dilute systems, we show that a hidden time-reversal symmetry prevents the emergence of ratchet currents. At higher densities, pairwise forces break this symmetry but an emergent conservation law for the momentum field may nevertheless prevent steady currents. We show how the presence of this conservation law can be tested analytically and characterize the onset of ratchet currents in its absence. Our results show that the ratchet principle should be amended to preclude parity symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and bulk momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>Branching Stochastic Processes for Feynman-Kac Representations of Drift-involving Non-linearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many drift-diffusion transport models rely on a coupling with a sub-model of the drift velocity. In this letter we extend Feynman-Kac's theory to provide probabilistic representations of such velocity-coupled models, so far remained out of reach. Hence a single embedded stochastic process is built, enabling such representations in a single branching path-space. To address this, we propose renewed physical insights in terms of propagative pictures to non-linear physics such as Navier-Stokes, Keller-Segel and Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations in confined and complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Path Search Algorithm on Free-Energy Landscape using Random Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a multidimensional free-energy or potential-energy landscape, finding reaction paths that connect an initial (or reactant) state and a final (or product) state is important for biophysics and materials science. The likelihood of a path can be evaluated using an objective function, and the most likely reaction path can be found by optimizing its objective function. However, nonlinear optimization on a complex free-energy or potential-energy landscape may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this study, this drawback is avoided using deterministic path-finding methods such as Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph by assigning grids on the coordinate system to graph nodes and relating the objective function of the path to the edge cost between the nodes. Furthermore, the use of random grids is proposed because they more accurately represent paths than regular grids. As a demonstration, the proposed method is successfully applied to find the minimum resistance path on a three-hole potential model, demonstrating that the proposed method is promising.</description>

      <title>Generalized free energy and excess entropy production for active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalized free energy potential for active systems, including both stochastic master equations and deterministic nonlinear chemical reaction networks. Our generalized free energy is defined variationally as the "most irreversible" state observable. This variational principle is motivated from several perspectives, including large deviations theory, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, Onsager theory, and information-theoretic optimal transport. In passive systems, the most irreversible observable is the usual free energy potential and its irreversibility is the entropy production rate (EPR). In active systems, the most irreversible observable is the generalized free energy and its irreversibility gives the excess EPR, the nonstationary contribution to dissipation. The remaining "housekeeping" EPR is a genuine nonequilibrium contribution that quantifies the nonconservative nature of the forces. We derive far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic speed limits for excess EPR, applicable to both linear and nonlinear systems. Our approach overcomes several limitations of the steady-state potential and the Hatano-Sasa (adiabatic/nonadiabatic) decomposition, as we demonstrate in several examples.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Yang-Lee zeros of the classical Ising model through the dynamic quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, the Loschmidt amplitude is analogous to the partition function in the canonical ensemble. Zeros in the partition function indicates a phase transition, while the presence of zeros in the Loschmidt amplitude indicates a dynamical quantum phase transition. Based on the classical-quantum correspondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising model is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics, thereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian dynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic quantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between Yang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization of the former.</description>

      <title>Boundary transitions from a single round of measurements on gapless quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements can qualitatively alter correlations and entanglement emerging in gapless quantum matter. We show how a single round of measurements on gapless quantum systems can, upon rotating the measurement basis, induce non-trivial transitions separating regimes displaying universal characteristics governed by distinct boundary conformal field theories. We develop the theory of such `measurement-induced boundary transitions' by investigating a gapless parent of the one-dimensional cluster state, obtained by appropriately symmetrizing a commuting projector Hamiltonian for the latter. Projective measurements on the cluster state are known to convert the wavefunction, after post-selection or decoding, into a long-range-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Similar measurements applied to the gapless parent (i) generate long-range order coexisting with power-law correlations when post-selecting for uniform outcomes, and (ii) yield power-law correlations distinct from those in the pre-measurement state upon decoding. In the post-selection scenario, rotating the measurement basis preserves long-range order up until a critical tilt angle marking a measurement-induced boundary transition to a power-law-ordered regime. Such a transition -- which does not exist in the descendant cluster state -- establishes new connections between measurement effects on many-body states and non-trivial renormalization-group flows. We extend our analysis to tricritical Ising and three-state Potts critical theories, which also display measurement-induced boundary transitions, and propose general criteria for their existence in other settings.</description>

Abstract: Using the framework of real scalar field theory on causal sets, the intimate relation of the Sorkin-Johnston vacuum to entropic purity is elucidated. It is shown that taking a set of sensible principles, and the most natural assumption on the space of fields, leaves the Sorkin-Johnston state as the only candidate for the global vacuum of a quasifree theory.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) explains how generic quantum many-body systems thermalize internally. It implies that local operators' time-averaged expectation values approximately equal their thermal expectation values, regardless of microscopic details. The ETH's range of applicability therefore impacts theory and experiments. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ recently showed that non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH. Such symmetries have excited interest in quantum thermodynamics lately, as they are equivalent to conserved quantities that fail to commute with each other and noncommutation is a quintessentially quantum phenomenon. Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ proposed a non-Abelian ETH, which we support numerically. The numerics model a one-dimensional (1D) next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain of up to 18 qubits. We represent local operators with matrices relative to an energy eigenbasis. The matrices bear out seven predictions of the non-Abelian ETH. We also prove analytically that the non-Abelian ETH exhibits a self-consistency property. The proof relies on a thermodynamic-entropy definition different from that in Murthy $\textit{et al.}$ This work initiates the observation and application of the non-Abelian ETH.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Informed Scattering Correlation Analysis of Sheared Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out theoretical analysis, Monte Carlo simulations and Machine Learning analysis to quantify microscopic rearrangements of dilute dispersions of spherical colloidal particles from coherent scattering intensity. Both monodisperse and polydisperse dispersions of colloids are created and undergo a rearrangement consisting of an affine simple shear and non-affine rearrangement using Monte Carlo method. We calculate the coherent scattering intensity of the dispersions and the correlation function of intensity before and after the rearrangement, and generate a large data set of angular correlation functions for varying system parameters, including number density, polydispersity, shear strain, and non-affine rearrangement. Singular value decomposition of the data set shows the feasibility of machine learning inversion from the correlation function for the polydispersity, shear strain, and non-affine rearrangement using only three parameters. A Gaussian process regressor is then trained based on the data set and can retrieve the affine shear strain, non-affine rearrangement, and polydispersity with a relative error of 3\%, 1\% and 6\%, respectively. Together, our model provides a framework for quantitative studies of both steady and non-steady microscopic dynamics of colloidal dispersions using coherent scattering methods.</description>

      <title>Spin-glass dynamics: experiment, theory and simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of high-quality single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose massive computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental time and length scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to the concept of temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change -- including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory -- are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</description>

      <title>Non-binary dynamical Ising machines for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical Ising machines achieve accelerated solving of complex combinatorial optimization problems by remapping the convergence to the ground state of the classical spin networks to the evolution of specially constructed continuous dynamical systems. The main adapted principle of constructing such systems is based on requiring that, on the one hand, the system converges to a binary state and, on the other hand, the system's energy in such states mimics the classical Ising Hamiltonian. The emergence of binary-like states is regarded to be an indispensable feature of dynamical Ising machines as it establishes the relation between the machine's continuous terminal state and the inherently discrete solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. This is emphasized by problems where the unknown quantities are represented by spin complexes, for example, the graph coloring problem. In such cases, an imprecise mapping of the continuous states to spin configurations may lead to invalid solutions requiring intensive post-processing. In contrast to such an approach, we show that there exists a class of non-binary dynamical Ising machines without the incongruity between the continuous character of the machine's states and the discreteness of the spin states. We demonstrate this feature by applying such a machine to the problems of finding proper graph coloring, constructing Latin squares, and solving Sudoku puzzles. Thus, we demonstrate that the information characterizing discrete states can be unambiguously presented in essentially continuous dynamical systems. This opens new opportunities in the realization of scalable electronic accelerators of combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the interplay between the lobby size $q$ in the $q$-neighbor Ising model of opinion formation (Phys. Rev. E 92, 052105) and the level of overlap $v$ of two fully connected graphs. Results suggest that for each lobby size $q \ge 3$, a specific level of overlap $v^*$ exists, which destroys initially polarized clusters of opinions. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, backed by an analytical approach, we show that the dependence of the $v^*$ on the lobby size $q$ is far from trivial in the absence of temperature, showing consecutive maximum and minimum, that additionally depends on the parity of $q$. The temperature is, in general, a destructive factor; its increase leads to the collapse of polarized clusters for smaller values of $v$ and additionally brings a substantial decrease in the level of polarization. However, we show that this behavior is counter-intuitively inverted for specific lobby sizes and temperature ranges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phases of free fermion systems with U(1) symmetry. Following a recent approach developed for Majorana chains, we derive a field theory description for the purity and bipartite entanglement at large space and time scales. We focus on a multi-flavor one-dimensional chain with random complex hoppings and continuous monitoring of the local fermion density. By means of the replica trick, and using the number of flavors as a large parameter controlling our approximations, we derive an effective field theory made up of a SU(N) non-linear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) coupled to fluctuating hydrodynamics. Contrary to the case of non-interacting Majorana fermions, displaying no U(1) symmetry, we find that the bipartite entanglement entropy satisfies an area law for all monitoring rates, but with a nontrivial scaling of entanglement when the correlation length is large. We provide numerical evidence supporting our claims. We briefly show how imposing a reality condition on the hoppings can change the NL$\sigma$M and also discuss higher dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the complete four-loop perturbative renormalization of a low-temperature statistical mechanics model of flat polymerized membranes. Using a non-local effective flexural theory, which is based on transverse elastic fluctuations, we analytically determine the anomalous elasticity critical exponent $\eta$, which controls all scaling behaviors in the theory, at the four existing fixed points. The results are obtained as apparently convergent series, allowing for precise estimates without resummations. We independently verify and supplement the results of recent four-loop work [Pikelner 2022 EPL 138 17002] derived from a different model. Additionally, we find good agreement with non-perturbative theoretical approaches and experimental results on soft materials and graphene.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model under a nonantisymmetric magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical study of dynamic phase transitions in the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model under a non-antisymmetric time-dependent magnetic field including a sinusoidal term and a second harmonic component. We demonstrate that the expected antisymmetric property and the scaling behavior of the order parameter are maintained using the recently proposed generalized conjugate field approach. Via a detailed finite-size scaling analysis we compute, for zero-bias field, the set of critical exponents suggesting that the Ising universality class is conserved, even in the absence of half-wave antisymmetry in the time-dependent magnetic field. Our results verify up-to-date experimental observations and provide a deeper understanding of non-equilibrium phase transitions, establishing a broader framework for exploring symmetry-breaking phenomena in driven magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>A supersymmetric SYK model with a curious low energy behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $\mathcal{N}$ = 2, 4 supersymmetric SYK models that have a peculiar low energy behavior, with the entropy going like $S = S_{0} + \text{(constant)}T^{a}$, where $a \neq 1$. The large $N$ equations for these models are a generalization of equations that have been previously studied as an unjustified truncation of the planar diagrams describing the BFSS matrix quantum mechanics or other related matrix models. Here we reanalyze these equations in order to better understand the low energy physics of these models. We find that the scalar fields develop large expectation values which explore the low energy valleys in the potential. The low energy physics is dominated by quadratic fluctuations around these values. These models were previously conjectured to have a spin glass phase. We did not find any evidence for this phase by using the usual diagnostics, such as searching for replica symmetry breaking solutions.</description>

      <title>Evidence that the AT transition disappears below six dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03711v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma &lt; 2/3$. We have found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$ implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quadratic dispersion relations in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent case-by-case studies revealed that the dispersion of low energy excitations in gapless frustration-free Hamiltonians is often quadratic or softer. In this work, we argue that this is actually a general property of such systems. By combining a previous study by Bravyi and Gosset and the min-max principle, we prove this hypothesis for models with local Hilbert spaces of dimension two that contains only nearest-neighbor interactions on cubic lattice. This may be understood as a no-go theorem realizing gapless phases with linearly dispersive excitations in frustration-free Hamiltonians. We also provide examples of frustration-free Hamiltonians in which the plane-wave state of a single spin flip does not constitute low energy excitations.</description>

      <title>On the linear scaling of entropy vs. energy in human brain activity, the Hagedorn temperature and the Zipf law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the brain spontaneously traverses through a very large number of states. Nevertheless, despite its relevance to understanding brain function, a formal description of this phenomenon is still lacking. To this end, we introduce a machine learning based method allowing for the determination of the probabilities of all possible states at a given coarse-graining, from which all the thermodynamics can be derived. This is a challenge not unique to the brain, since similar problems are at the heart of the statistical mechanics of complex systems. This paper uncovers a linear scaling of the entropies and energies of the brain states, a behaviour first conjectured by Hagedorn to be typical at the limiting temperature in which ordinary matter disintegrates into quark matter. Equivalently, this establishes the existence of a Zipf law scaling underlying the appearance of a wide range of brain states. Based on our estimation of the density of states for large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) human brain recordings, we observe that the brain operates asymptotically at the Hagedorn temperature. The presented approach is not only relevant to brain function but should be applicable for a wide variety of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties, localization transition and multifractal eigenvectors of the Laplacian on heterogeneous networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties and eigenvector statistics of the Laplacian on highly-connected networks with random coupling strengths and a gamma distribution of rescaled degrees. The spectral density, the distribution of the local density of states, the singularity spectrum and the multifractal exponents of this model exhibit a rich behaviour as a function of the first two moments of the coupling strengths and the variance of the rescaled degrees. In the case of random coupling strengths, the spectral density diverges within the bulk of the spectrum when degree fluctuations are strong enough. The emergence of this singular behaviour marks a transition from non-ergodic delocalized states to localized eigenvectors that exhibit pronounced multifractal scaling. For constant coupling strengths, the bulk of the spectrum is characterized by a regular spectral density. In this case, the corresponding eigenvectors display localization properties reminiscent of the critical point of the Anderson localization transition on random graphs.</description>

      <title>Multifractaility, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore evolution of its properties with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system remains gapped and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, the system forms a gapless multifractal state. We also establish that anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Autonomous demon exploiting heat and information at the trajectory level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an electronic bipartite system consisting of a working substance, in which a refrigeration process is implemented, and of a nonthermal resource region, containing a combination of different thermal baths. In the working substance, heat is extracted from the coldest of two electronic reservoirs (refrigeration) via heat- and particle transport through a quantum dot. This quantum dot of the working substance is capacitively coupled to the resource region. In such a setup, a finite cooling power can be obtained in the working substance, while the energy exchange with the resource region exactly cancels out on average. At the same time, information is always exchanged, even on average, due to the capacitive coupling between the two parts of the bipartite system. The proposed system therefore implements an autonomous demon with fully vanishing heat extraction from the resource. Unlike macroscopic machines, nanoscale machines exhibit large fluctuations in performance, so precision becomes an important performance quantifier. We give a comprehensive description of the thermodynamic performance of the proposed autonomous demon in terms of stochastic trajectories and of full counting statistics and demonstrate that the precision of the cooling power strongly depends on the operation principle of the device. More specifically, the interplay of information flow and counter-balancing heat flows dramatically impacts the trade-off between cooling power, efficiency, and precision. We expect this insight to be of relevance for guiding the design of energy-conversion processes exploiting nonthermal resources.</description>
