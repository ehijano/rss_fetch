      <title>Optimizing the ground state energy of the three-dimensional magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the shape optimization problem of minimizing the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field among three-dimensional domains of fixed volume. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, a generalized ''magnetic'' Faber-Krahn inequality does not hold and the minimizers are not expected to be balls when the magnetic field is turned on. An analysis of the problem among cylindrical domains reveals geometric constraints for general minimizers. In particular, minimizers must elongate with a certain rate along the direction of the magnetic field as the field strength increases. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we present numerical minimizers which confirm this prediction and give rise to further conjectures.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations on Dimer Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that when two toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds and their corresponding toric varieties are related by a birational transformation, they are associated with a pair of dimer models on the 2-torus that define dimer integrable systems, which themselves become birationally equivalent. These integrable systems defined by dimer models were first introduced by Goncharov and Kenyon. We illustrate this equivalence explicitly using a pair of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the abelian orbifolds of the form C^3/Z_4 x Z_2 with orbifold action (1,0,3)(0,1,1) and C/Z_2 x Z_2 with action (1,0,0,1)(0,1,1,0), whose spectral curves and Hamiltonians are shown to be related by a birational transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing hierarchies of solutions to $n$-simplex equations by variating the spectral parameter in their Lax representation. We use this method to derive new solutions to the set-theoretical 2- and 3-simplex equations which are related to the Adler map and Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) type equations. Moreover, we prove that some of the derived Yang--Baxter maps are completely integrable.</description>

      <title>Confluent supersymmetric algorithm for bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External magnetic field profiles leading to equidistant and partially equidistant bilayer graphene spectra within the tight-binding model are obtained. This is achieved by implementing the integral and differential versions of the second-order confluent algorithm to the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary real factorization energies. Additionally, new Barut-Girardello and Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states for bilayer graphene are derived, for both diagonal and non-diagonal ladder operators. Their time evolution is analyzed, finding temporal stability and cyclic evolution in some cases. This fact is contrasted with the non-cyclic evolution of bilayer graphene coherent states obtained when using two different factorization energies. Likewise, the geometric phase and uncertainty product of the quadratures for the previously obtained coherent states are studied.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld super Yangian of the exceptional Lie superalgebra $D(2,1;\lambda)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the first rigorous framework for the Drinfeld super Yangian associated with an exceptional Lie superalgebra, which lacks a classical Lie algebraic counterpart. Specifically, we systematically investigate the Drinfeld presentation and structural properties of the super Yangian associated with the exceptional Lie superalgebra $D(2,1;\lambda)$. First, we introduce a Drinfeld presentation for the super Yangian associated with the exceptional Lie superalgebra $D(2,1;\lambda)$, explicitly constructing its current generators and defining relations. A key innovation is the construction of a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt (PBW) basis using degeneration techniques from the corresponding quantum loop superalgebra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the super Yangian possesses a Hopf superalgebra structure, explicitly providing the coproduct, counit, and antipode.</description>

      <title>Ultra-discretization of Yang-Baxter maps, probability distributions and independence preserving property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied in arXiv:0911.2895 . Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

      <title>Imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on a torus and on a pair of balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a general spectral approach based on the Steklov eigenbasis to describe imperfect diffusion-controlled reactions on bounded reactive targets in three dimensions. The steady-state concentration and the total diffusive flux onto the target are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the exterior Steklov problem. In particular, the eigenvalues are shown to provide the geometric lengthscales of the target that are relevant for diffusion-controlled reactions. Using toroidal and bispherical coordinates, we propose an efficient procedure for analyzing and solving numerically this spectral problem for an arbitrary torus and a pair of balls, respectively. A simple two-term approximation for the diffusive flux is established and validated. Implications of these results in the context of chemical physics and beyond are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Yang algebras isomorphic to $o(1,5), o(2,4), o(3,3)$ and derive dual $\kappa$-Minkowski and $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebras in terms of a metric $g$. The corresponding Weyl realization is presented and coproduct, star product and twist are computed in terms of the metric $g$. Finally, we construct reduced $\kappa$-Minkowski and $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebras as special cases.</description>

      <title>Multi-lump, lump-kink and interaction of breather with other nonlinear waves of a couple Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction characteristics of nonlinear coherent structures in the couple Boussinesq (CB) system using the Hirota bilinear approach. First, we derive the lump solutions using a positive quadratic polynomial within the Hirota perturbation technique. Next, We study the explicit interactions between lumps and one or two-kink waves, and observe double lump patterns. Furthermore, we discover the interactions of breathers, revealing a diffusion-like behavior. We notice that breather waves can interact with periodic, kink, and bright solitons for specific parameter sets in the CB system. Interactions between two chains of double breathers are also found. We analyze our results using a combination of symbolic computations and graphical representations, providing a deeper understanding of their behavior. This study reveals previously unreported nonlinear dynamics in the CB system.</description>

      <title>Schwinger's non-commutative coordinates and duality between helicity and Dirac quantisation conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The helicity operator of massless particles has only two polarisations like it takes place for photons and gravitons. For them not all of the 2s+1 spin magnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions, and the spin operator ceases to be defined properly and consistently. The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operator appears explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity. The associativity relation is broken by a phase factor which satisfies a 3-cocycle relation. The associativity is restored when a 3-cocycle is an integer number, and leads to the quantisation of massless particle's helicity. We discuss the correspondence (duality) between the helicity and the Dirac quantisation conditions.</description>

      <title>Flow Through Porous Media: A Hopf-Cole Transformation Approach for Modeling Pressure-Dependent Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most organic liquids exhibit a pressure-dependent viscosity, making it crucial to consider this behavior in applications where pressures significantly exceed ambient conditions (e.g., geological carbon sequestration). Mathematical models describing flow through porous media while accounting for viscosity-pressure dependence are nonlinear (e.g., the Barus model). This nonlinearity complicates mathematical analysis and makes numerical solutions more time-intensive and prone to convergence issues. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Hopf-Cole transformation, originally developed for Burgers' equation, can recast the governing equations -- describing flow through porous media with pressure-dependent viscosity -- into a linear form. The transformed equations, resembling Darcy's equations in the transformed variables, enable (a) systematic mathematical analysis to establish uniqueness and maximum principles, (b) the derivation of a mechanics-based principle, and (c) the development of efficient numerical solutions using solvers optimized for Darcy equations. Notably, many properties of the linear Darcy equations naturally extend to nonlinear models that depend on pressure. For example, solutions to these nonlinear models adhere to a reciprocal relation analogous to that observed in Darcy's equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra and show that it is a Hopf algebra. The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an admissible Drinfel'd twist, making the algebra a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra. The fundamental representation of the universal R-matrix yields the familiar set-theoretic (combinatorial) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We then apply the same Drinfel'd twist to the gl_n Yangian after introducing the augmented Yangian. We show that the augmented Yangian is also a Hopf algebra and we obtain the twisted version of the augmented gl_n Yangian as well as the twisted R-matrix.</description>

      <title>A simple range characterization for spherical mean transform in even dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a new and simple range characterization for the spherical mean transform of functions supported in the unit ball in even dimensions. It complements the previous work of the same authors, where they solved an analogous problem in odd dimensions. The range description in even dimensions consists of symmetry relations, using a special kind of elliptic integrals involving the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansion of the function in the range of the transform. The article also introduces a pair of original identities involving normalized Bessel functions of the first and the second kind. The first result is an integral cross-product identity for Bessel functions of integer order, complementing a similar relation for Bessel functions of half-integer order obtained in the aforementioned work of the same authors. The second result is a new Nicholson-type identity. Both of these relations can be considered as important standalone results in the theory of special functions. Finally, as part of the proof of one of the theorems, the authors derive an interesting equality involving elliptic integrals, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-standard quantum algebras and infinite-dimensional PT-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a PT-symmetric infinite-dimensional representation of the Uz(sl(2,R)) Hopf algebra, and we analyse a multiparametric family of Hamiltonians constructed from such representation of the generators of this non-standard quantum algebra. It is shown that all these Hamiltonians can be mapped to equivalent systems endowed with a position-dependent mass. From the latter presentation, it is shown how appropriate point canonical transformations can be further defined in order to transform them into Hamiltonians with constant mass over suitable domains. By following this approach, the bound-state spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the initial PT-symmetric Hamiltonians can be determined. It is worth stressing that a relevant feature of some of the new Uz(sl(2,R)) systems here presented is found to be their connection with double-well and P\"oschl-Teller potentials. In fact, as an application we present a particular Hamiltonian that can be expressed as an effective double-well trigonometric potential, which is commonly used to model several relevant systems in molecular physics.</description>

Abstract: The finiteness problem of stationary configurations for the planar five-vortex problem is considered in this paper. The numbers of equilibria and rigidly translating configurations are shown to be at most 6 and 24 respectively. The numbers of relative equilibria and collapse configurations are shown to be finite, except perhaps if the 5-tuple of vorticities belongs to a given codimension 2 subvariety of the vorticity space. In particular, if the vorticities are of the same sign, the number of stationary configurations is finite.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations are widely used to model irreversible processes in complex systems in physics. Recently, it has been studied that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We refer to these manifolds as finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations in probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, as well as Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a simplex set with a three-point lattice.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Anderson operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the continuous Anderson operator $H=\Delta+\xi$ on a two dimensional closed Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{S}$. We provide a short self-contained functional analysis construction of the operator as an unbounded operator on $L^2(\mathcal{S})$ and give almost sure spectral gap estimates under mild geometric assumptions on the Riemannian manifold. We prove a sharp Gaussian small time asymptotic for the heat kernel of $H$ that leads amongst others to strong norm estimates for quasimodes. We introduce a new random field, called Anderson Gaussian free field, and prove that the law of its random partition function characterizes the law of the spectrum of $H$. We also give a simple and short construction of the polymer measure on path space and relate the Wick square of the Anderson Gaussian free field to the occupation measure of a Poisson process of loops of polymer paths. We further prove large deviation results for the polymer measure and its bridges.</description>

      <title>Liouville-Arnold theorem for homogeneous symplectic and contact Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian system is completely integrable (in the sense of Liouville) if there exist as many independent integrals of motion in involution as the dimension of the configuration space. Under certain regularity conditions, Liouville-Arnold theorem states that the invariant geometric structure associated with Liouville integrability is a fibration by Lagrangian tori (or, more generally, Abelian Lie groups), on which the motion is linear. In this paper, a Liouville-Arnold theorem for contact Hamiltonian systems is proven. More specifically, it is shown that, given a $(2n+1)$-dimensional completely integrable contact system, one can construct a foliation by $(n+1)$-dimensional Abelian Lie groups and induce action-angle coordinates in which the equations of motion are linearized. One important novelty with respect to previous attempts is that the foliation consists of $(n+1)$-dimensional coisotropic submanifolds given by the preimages of rays by the functions in involution. In order to prove the theorem, we first develop a version of Liouville-Arnold theorem for homogeneous functions on exact symplectic manifolds (which is of independent interest), and then apply the symplectization to obtain the contact case.</description>

      <title>Triviality of the scaling limits of critical Ising and $\varphi^4$ models with effective dimension at least four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any scaling limit of a critical reflection positive Ising or $\varphi^4$ model of effective dimension $d_{\text{eff}}$ at least four is Gaussian. This extends the recent breakthrough work of Aizenman and Duminil-Copin -- which demonstrates the corresponding result in the setup of nearest-neighbour interactions in dimension four -- to the case of long-range reflection positive interactions satisfying $d_{\text{eff}}=4$. The proof relies on the random current representation which provides a geometric interpretation of the deviation of the models' correlation functions from Wick's law. When $d=4$, long-range interactions are handled with the derivation of a criterion that relates the speed of decay of the interaction to two different mechanisms that entail Gaussianity: interactions with a sufficiently slow decay induce a faster decay at the level of the model's two-point function, while sufficiently fast decaying interactions force a simpler geometry on the currents which allows to extend nearest-neighbour arguments. When $1\leq d\leq 3$ and $d_{\text{eff}}=4$, the phenomenology is different as long-range effects play a prominent role.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of State Spaces into Subobjects in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive formalism for decomposing the state space of a quantum field into several entangled subobjects, i.e., fields generating a subspace of states. Projecting some of the subobjects onto degenerate background states reduces the system to an effective field theory depending on parameters representing the degeneracies. Notably, these parameters are not exogenous. The entanglement among subobjects in the initial system manifests as an interrelation between parameters and non-projected subobjects. Untangling this dependency necessitates imposing linear first-order equations on the effective field. The geometric characteristics of the parameter spaces depend on both the effective field and the background of the projected subobjects. The system, governed by arbitrary variables, has no dynamics, but the projection of some subobjects can be interpreted as slicing the original state space according to the lowest eigenvalues of a parameter-dependent family of operators. The slices can be endowed with amplitudes similar to some transitions between each other, contingent upon these eigenvalues. Averaging over all possible transitions shows that the amplitudes are higher for maps with increased eigenvalue than for maps with decreasing eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Horizon classification via Riemannian flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the geometry of connected totally geodesic compact null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds is only slightly more specialized than that of Riemannian flows over compact manifolds, the latter mathematical theory having been much studied in the context of foliation theory since the work by Reinhart (Ann Math 69:119, 1959). We are then able to import results on Riemannian flows to the horizon case, so obtaining theorems on the dynamical structure of compact horizons that do not rely on (non-)degeneracy assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between isometric/geodesible Riemannian flows and non-degeneracy conditions. This work also contains some positive results on the possibility of finding, in the degenerate case, lightlike fields tangent to the horizon that have zero surface gravity.</description>

      <title>How to Construct Random Unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In physics literature about supersymmetry, many authors refer to "super Minkowski spaces". These spaces are affine supermanifolds with certain distinguished spin structures. In these notes, we make the notion of such spin structures precise and generalise the setup to curved supermanifolds. This leads to the more general notion of spinorial superspaces. By working in a suitable geometric and coordinate-free setting, many explicit coordinate computations appearing in physics literature can be replaced by more conceptual methods. As an application of the rather general framework of spinorial superspaces, we formulate $\mathcal N = 1$ super Yang-Mills theories on curved superspaces of spacetime dimensions $d=3$ and $d=4$ and show how to reduce the theory to field theories defined on an underlying ordinary spacetime manifold.</description>

      <title>Determinant, Characteristic Polynomial, and Inverse in Commutative Analogues of Clifford Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commutative analogues of Clifford algebras are algebras defined in the same way as Clifford algebras except that their generators commute with each other, in contrast to Clifford algebras in which the generators anticommute. In this paper, we solve the problem of finding multiplicative inverses in commutative analogues of Clifford algebras by introducing a matrix representation for these algebras and the notion of determinant in them. We give a criteria for checking if an element has a multiplicative inverse or not and, for the first time, explicit formulas for multiplicative inverses in the case of arbitrary dimension. The new theorems involve only operations of conjugation and do not involve matrix operations. We also consider notions of trace and other characteristic polynomial coefficients and give explicit formulas for them without using matrix representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of topological terms that modify the Hilbert-Einstein action is here explored by virtue of a further $f(G)$ contribution. In particular, we investigate the phase-space stability and critical points of an equivalent scalar field representation that makes use of a massive field, whose potential is function of the topological correction. To do so, we introduce to the gravitational Action Integral a Lagrange multiplier and model the modified Friedmann equations by virtue of new non-dimensional variables. We single out dimensionless variables that permit \emph{a priori} the Hubble rate change of sign, enabling regions in which the Hubble parameter either vanishes or becomes negative. In this respect, we thus analyze the various possibilities associated with a universe characterized by such topological contributions and find the attractors, saddle points and regions of stability, in general. The overall analysis is carried out considering the exponential potential first and then shifting to more complicated cases, where the underlying variables do not simplify. We compute the eigenvalues of our coupled differential equations and, accordingly, the stability of the system, in both a spatially-flat and non-flat universe. Quite remarkably, regardless of the spatial curvature, we show that a stable de Sitter-like phase that can model current time appears only a small fraction of the entire phase-space, suggesting that the model under exam is unlikely in describing the whole universe dynamics, i.e., the topological terms appear disfavored in framing the entire evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary state creation via controlled measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial state creation is a starting point of many quantum algorithms and usually is considered as a separate subroutine not included into the algorithm itself. There are many algorithms aimed on creation of special class of states. Our algorithm allows creating an arbitrary $n$-qubit pure quantum superposition state with precision of $m$-decimals (binary representation) for each probability amplitude. The algorithm uses one-qubit rotations, Hadamard transformations and C-NOT operations with multi-qubit controls. However, the crucial operation is the final controlled measurement of the ancilla state that removes the garbage part of the superposition state and allows to avoid the problem of small success probability in that measurement. We emphasize that rotation angles are predicted in advance by the required precision and therefore there is no classical calculation supplementing quantum algorithm. The depth and space of the algorithm growth with $n$ as, respectively, $O(2^n n)$ and $O(n)$. This algorithm can be a subroutine generating the required input state in various algorithms, in particular, in matrix-manipulation algorithms developed earlier.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of quantum measurements presents a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics, with concepts such as the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), and Bohmian Mechanics (BM) offering distinct perspectives. We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI), which describes measurement as branching the local Hilbert space of a system into decoherent subspaces. We formalize the mathematical framework of BHSI using branching and the engaging and disengaging unitary operators to relationally and causally update the states of observers. Unlike the MWI, BHSI avoids the ontological proliferation of worlds and copies of observers, realizing the Born rule based on branch weights. Unlike the CI, BHSI retains the essential features of the MWI: unitary evolution and no wavefunction collapse. Unlike the BM, BHSI does not depend on a nonlocal structure, which may conflict with relativity. We compare CI, MWI, and BHSI in the double-slit experiment, Bell tests, Wigner and his friend, the black hole information paradox, and the delayed choice quantum eraser. Additionally, we examine the environmental scale of branching in MWI versus BHSI (maximal vs. minimal) and investigate whether recohering branches can be realized. Overall, BHSI offers a minimalist, unitarity-preserving, collapse-free, and probabilistically inherent alternative interpretation of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of (Stochastic) Lagrangian Trajectories for Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories associated with Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. First, in the vanishing viscosity limit, we establish sharp non-uniqueness results for positive solutions to transport equations advected by weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations that exhibit kinetic energy dissipation with $C_{t,x}^{1/3-}$ regularity. As a corollary, in conjunction with the superposition principle, this yields the non-uniqueness of associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectories. Second, in dimension $d\geq2$, for any $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{r}&gt;1$ or $p\in(1,2),r=\infty$, we construct solutions to the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations in the space $L_t^rL^p\cap L_t^1W^{1,1}$, demonstrating that the associated (stochastic) Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. Our result is sharp in 2D in the sense that: (1) in the stochastic case, for any vector field $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$, the associated stochastic Lagrangian trajectory associated with $v$ is unique (see \cite{KR05}); (2) in the deterministic case, the LPS condition guarantees that for any weak solution $v\in C_tL^p$ with $p&gt;2$ to the Navier-Stokes equations, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique. Our result is also sharp in dimension $d\geq2$ in the sense that for any divergence-free vector field $v\in L_t^1W^{1,s}$ with $s&gt;d$, the associated (deterministic) Lagrangian trajectory is unique (see \cite{CC21}).</description>

Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of nonlinear pendulum are derived for all three classes of motion: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum. A simple formula for the complete elliptical integral of the first kind is also proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the midrange maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>
