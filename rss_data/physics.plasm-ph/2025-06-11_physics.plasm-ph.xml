      <title>The effect of plasma expansion on the dispersion properties of MHD waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08248v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employ the set of ideal expanding magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations within the Expanding Box Model (EBM) framework to theoretically characterize the effects of radial solar wind expansion on its characteristic linear MHD waves. Through the analytical derivation of dispersion relations by a first-order expansion of the MHD-EBM equations, we explore the changes in wave propagation across a range of heliocentric distances on the linear magnetohydrodynamic modes: the Alfv\'en mode and the fast and slow magnetosonic modes, as obtained from the ideal MHD-EBM equations. Our findings reveal a spatial dependence in the derived dispersion relations that aligns with both the literature and the traditional ideal MHD case in the non-expanding limit, thereby helping to bridge the gap between theory and observation in solar wind dynamics. We observe a general decrease in wave frequencies as the plasma expands farther from the Sun. This decrease is reflected in the dispersion relations through the radial decrease of both the Alfv\'en and sound speeds, which decrease proportionally to $1/R$ and $1/R^{\gamma - 1}$, respectively, where $\gamma$ is the plasma polytropic index. The fast magnetosonic mode frequency and phase speed are significantly affected by the polytropic index value. We consider three models for the polytropic index evolution in the expanding solar wind: a constant (quasi-adiabatic) case, a radially decreasing profile in the outer heliosphere, and a model incorporating thermodynamic heating effects. Notably, we find that in the case of a decreasing polytropic index, the fast magnetosonic mode experiences an acceleration in the distant heliosphere, highlighting the significant influence of expansion on solar wind dynamics.</description>

      <title>Particle collisionality in scaled kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic plasma processes, such as magnetic reconnection, collisionless shocks, and turbulence, are fundamental to the dynamics of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Simulating these processes often requires particle-in-cell (PIC) methods, but the computational cost of fully kinetic simulations can necessitate the use of artificial parameters, such as a reduced speed of light and ion-to-electron mass ratio, to decrease expense. While these approximations can preserve overall dynamics under specific conditions, they introduce nontrivial impacts on particle collisionality that are not yet well understood. In this work, we develop a method to scale particle collisionality in simulations employing such approximations. By introducing species-dependent scaling factors, we independently adjust inter- and intra-species collision rates to better replicate the collisional properties of the physical system. Our approach maintains the fidelity of electron and ion transport properties while preserving critical relaxation rates, such as energy exchange timescales, within the limits of weakly collisional plasma theory. We demonstrate the accuracy of this scaling method through benchmarking tests against theoretical relaxation rates and connecting to fluid theory, highlighting its ability to retain key transport properties. Existing collisional PIC implementations can be easily modified to include this scaling, which will enable deeper insights into the behavior of marginally collisional plasmas across various contexts.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of isochoric heating experiments using the TROLL code in the warm dense matter regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments of isochoric heating by protons of solid material were recently performed at LULI laser facilities. In these experiments, protons, produced from target normal sheath acceleration (TNSA) of Au foil with the PICO2000 laser, deposit their energy into an aluminum or copper foil initially at room temperature and solid density. The heated material reaches the warm dense matter regime with temperature in the rear face of the material between 1 and 5 eV. The temperature is inferred by streaked optical pyrometry and the proton beam is characterized by Thomson parabola. The high-energy protons produced by TNSA are modeled to deduce the initial proton distribution before the slowing down in the target. Hydrodynamic radiative simulations were next performed using the TROLL code in multidimensional geometry. In the TROLL code, the heating of protons is modeled with a Monte-Carlo transport module of charged particle and the calculation of the energy deposited by the protons in the matter is performed using stopping power formulas like SRIM functions. The results of simulations with the TROLL code are compared with the experimental results. An acceptable agreement between experiment and simulation is found for the temperature at the rear of the material using SESAME equation of state and SRIM stopping power for protons in aluminum.</description>

      <title>Planar Collisionless Shock Simulations with Semi-Implicit Particle-in-Cell Model FLEKS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of the semi-implicit particle-in-cell code FLEKS to collisionless shock simulations, with a focus on the parameter regime relevant to global magnetosphere modeling. We examine one- and two-dimensional local planar shock simulations, initialized using MHD states with upstream conditions representative of the solar wind at 1 au, for both quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel configurations. The refined algorithm in FLEKS proves robust, enabling accurate shock simulations with a grid resolution on the order of the electron inertial length $d_e$. Our simulations successfully capture key shock features, including shock structures (foot, ramp, overshoot, and undershoot), upstream and downstream waves (fast magnetosonic, whistler, Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron, and mirror modes), and non-Maxwellian particle distributions. Crucially, we find that at least two spatial dimensions are critical for accurately reproducing downstream wave physics in quasi-perpendicular shocks and capturing the complex dynamics of quasi-parallel shocks, including surface rippling, shocklets, SLAMS, and jets. Furthermore, our parameter studies demonstrate the impact of mass ratio and grid resolution on shock physics. This work provides valuable guidance for selecting appropriate physical and numerical parameters for a semi-implicit PIC code, paving the way for incorporating kinetic shock processes into large-scale space plasma simulations with the MHD-AEPIC model.</description>

      <title>Meter-scale Observations of Equatorial Plasma Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-Needle Langmuir Probe collects an electron current through four fixed-bias cylindrical copper needles. This allows for an extremely high sampling frequency, with plasma properties being inferred through polynomial fitting in the current-voltage plane. We present initial results from such a multi-needle probe mounted on the International Space Station, orbiting Earth at an altitude of around 400 km. That altitude, and its orbital inclination (~50 degrees), place the ISS as a suitable platform for observing equatorial plasma bubbles. In case studies of such turbulent structuring of the F-region plasma, we observe density timeseries that conserve considerable detail at virtually every level of magnification down to its Nyquist scale of 2-5 meters. We present power spectral density estimates of the turbulent structuring found inside equatorial plasma bubbles, and we discuss apparent break-points at scale-sizes between 1 m and 300 m, which we interpret in the light of turbulent dissipation as kilometer-scale swirls produced by the gradient-drift instability dissipate in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Driven phase-mixed Alfv\'en waves in a partially ionized solar plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase mixing has long been understood to be a viable mechanism for expediting the dissipation of Alfv\'en wave energy resulting in the subsequent heating of the solar atmosphere. To fulfil the conditions necessary for phase mixing to occur, we consider the cross-field gradient in the Alfv\'en speed as a free parameter in our model. Using a single-fluid description of a partially ionized chromospheric plasma, we explore the efficiency of damping of shear Alfv\'en waves subject to phase mixing when a pulse wave driver is employed. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of the dissipation length of shear Alfv\'en waves on both the ionization degree of the plasma and the gradient of the Alfv\'en speed. When assessing the efficiency of phase mixing across various inhomogeneities, our findings indicate that waves originating from a pulse driver exhibit initially identical heating rates as those generated by a continuous wave driver. One key difference observed was that Alfv\'en pulses possess a lower overall decay rate due to a change in damping profile from exponential to algebraic. This discrepancy arises from the absence of a consistent injection of energy into the base of the domain, that preserves longitudinal gradients of the magnetic field perturbations more effectively. These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the relations between the wave driver, damping mechanisms, and propagation dynamics in resolving the atmospheric heating problem.</description>

      <title>Probing Strong-Field QED via Angle-Discriminated Emissions from Electrons Traversing Colliding Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future laser-electron colliders will reach quantum parameters $\chi$ well in excess of unity, enabling studies of strong-field QED in extreme regimes. However, statistical inference in such experiments requires mitigating premature radiative losses of electrons to enable high-$\chi$ QED events, as well as separating the detectable signal of these events from that of lower-$\chi$ particles and photons produced by QED cascades. We propose a collider geometry in which electrons traverse the waist of two or four perpendicularly propagating, tightly focused laser pulses. This configuration suppresses both outlined difficulties by leveraging the short interaction length of the waist, rather than relying on the more technically demanding reduction of pulse duration. Moreover, altering the phase and polarization of each pulse causes the electrons to undergo helical motion where the deflection angle is correlated with the field strength, permitting an angle-based discrimination of the signal from high-$\chi$ events. Analysis and simulations show that the case of four circularly polarized pulses uniquely permits achieving helical motion throughout the entire focal region, leading to near-perfect high-$\chi$ angle-discrimination and thereby high signal-to-noise ratio. These findings support the consideration of the proposed concept as a viable layout for future experiments at PW laser facilities.</description>

Abstract: We outline a method of beamed power for propulsion that utilizes relativistic electron beams. The physics of charged particle beam propagation in the space plasma environment is discussed and the long-range (&gt;100 A.U.) advantage of relativistic electron beams is emphasized. A preliminary statite based beam emitter for powering probes to ~0.1c is proposed and the challenges in beam-power uses are explored.</description>

      <title>The nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale convective flows of magnetized plasma, generated by the inhomogeneous microturbulenc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the nonmodal kinetic theory of the macroscale convective flows of magnetized plasma, which stem from the average motion of ions and electrons in the electric field of the spatially inhomogeneous microturbulence. This theory bases on the two-scales approach to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations for magnetized plasma, in which the solutions depend simultaneously on micro and macro scales. The developed theory predicts the generation of the sheared poloidal convective flow and of the radial compressed flow with radial flow velocity gradient. It was found that the macroscale (radial) inhomogeneity of the spectral intensity of the microturbulence is the condition necessary for the development of the two-dimensional non-diffusive convective plasma flows. The developed theory includes the theory of the evolution of the microscale turbulence in the sheared-compressed convective flows, formed by the microturbulence, and the theory of the slow macroscale evolution of a bulk of plasma by the compressed-sheared convective flows.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Control of MeV Electrons and Protons from kHz Repetition Rate Ultra-Intense Laser Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-intense laser-matter interactions are often difficult to predict from first principles because of the complexity of plasma processes and the many degrees of freedom relating to the laser and target parameters. An important approach to controlling and optimizing ultra-intense laser interactions involves gathering large data sets and using this data to train statistical and machine learning models. In this paper we describe experimental efforts to accelerate electrons and protons to $\sim$MeV energies with this goal in mind. These experiments involve a 1 kHz repetition rate ultra-intense laser system with $\sim$10mJ per shot, a peak intensity near $5 \times 10^{18}$ W/cm$^{2}$, and a "liquid leaf" target. Improvements to the data acquisition capabilities of this laser system greatly aided this investigation. Generally, we find that the trained models were very effective for controlling the numbers of MeV electrons ejected. The models were less successful at shifting the energy range of ejected electrons. Simultaneous control of the numbers of $\sim$MeV electrons and the energy range will be the subject of future experimentation using this platform.</description>
