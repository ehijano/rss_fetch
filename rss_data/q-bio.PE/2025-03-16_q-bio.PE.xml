      <title>A theory of ecological invasions and its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously structured compartmental models of epidemiological systems: from individual-level processes to population-scale dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general modelling framework for compartmental epidemiological systems structured by continuous variables which are linked to the levels of expression of compartment-specific traits. We start by formulating an individual-based model that describes the dynamics of single individuals in terms of stochastic processes. Then we formally derive: (i) the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which is formulated as a system of integro-differential equations for the distributions of individuals over the structuring-variable domains of the different compartments; (ii) the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a system of ordinary differential equations for the fractions of individuals in the different compartments and the mean levels of expression of the traits represented by the structuring variables. We employ a reduced version of the macroscopic model to obtain a general formula for the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, in terms of key parameters and functions of the underlying microscopic model, so as to illustrate how such a modelling framework makes it possible to draw connections between fundamental individual-level processes and population-scale dynamics. Finally we apply the modelling framework to case studies based on classical compartmental epidemiological systems, for each of which we report on Monte Carlo simulations of the individual-based model as well as on analytical results and numerical solutions of the macroscopic model.</description>

      <title>Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Demography-independent behavioural dynamics influenced the spread of COVID-19 in Denmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the factors that impact how a communicable disease like COVID-19 spreads is of central importance to mitigate future outbreaks. Traditionally, epidemic surveillance and forecasting analyses have focused on epidemiological data but recent advancements have demonstrated that monitoring behavioural changes may be equally important. Prior studies have shown that high-frequency survey data on social contact behaviour were able to improve predictions of epidemiological observables during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the full potential of such highly granular survey data remains debated. Here, we utilise daily nationally representative survey data from Denmark collected during 23 months of the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate two central use-cases for such high-frequency survey data. First, we show that complex behavioural patterns across demographics collapse to a small number of universal key features, greatly simplifying the monitoring and analysis of adherence to outbreak-mitigation measures. Notably, the temporal evolution of the self-reported median number of face-to-face contacts follows a universal behavioural pattern across age groups, with potential to simplify analysis efforts for future outbreaks. Second, we show that these key features can be leveraged to improve deep-learning-based predictions of daily reported new infections. In particular, our models detect a strong link between aggregated self-reported social distancing and hygiene behaviours and the number of new cases in the subsequent days. Taken together, our results highlight the value of high-frequency surveys to improve our understanding of population behaviour in an ongoing public health crisis and its potential use for prediction of central epidemiological observables.</description>

      <title>Genealogical transition in the noisy $N$-Branching Random Walk. How stronger selection may promote genetic diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the noisy $N$-Branching Random Walk that models the evolution of a population subject to natural selection. We show the existence of a critical value for the noise which separates the limiting genealogical structure into two regimes, which we respectively call the semi-pulled and the fully-pulled regimes. In the fully-pulled regime, the genealogy converges to a discrete time Poisson-Dirichlet coalescent. In the semi-pulled regime, the genealogy converges to the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent. We discuss some interesting biological consequences of this result. In particular, our model predicts a non-monotone relation between the selection strength and the effective population size.</description>

      <title>A generalised sigmoid population growth model with energy dependence: application to quantify the tipping point for Antarctic shallow seabed algae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sigmoid growth models are often used to study population dynamics. The size of a population at equilibrium commonly depends explicitly on the availability of resources, such as an energy or nutrient source, which is not explicit in standard sigmoid growth models. A simple generalised extension of sigmoid growth models is introduced that can explicitly account for this resource-dependence, demonstrated by three examples of this family of models of increasing mathematical complexity. Each model is calibrated and compared to observed data for algae under sea-ice in Antarctic coastal waters. It was found that through careful construction, models satisfying the proposed framework can estimate key properties of a sea-ice break-out controlled tipping point for the algae, which cannot be estimated using standard sigmoid growth models. The proposed broader family of energy-dependent sigmoid growth models likely has usage in many population growth contexts where resources limit population size.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Oxygenic Origins of Thylakoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thylakoid membranes are the site of oxygenic photosynthesis, one of the most important biochemical processes on earth. The ancestral state of these membranes is represented today in Gloeobacterales, where they are lacking and photosynthesis instead takes place in the cytoplasmic membrane. The evolutionary transition from this ancestral state to the modern thylakoid membranes was a major advantage, as it increased surface area devoted to the photosystems and thus photosynthetic efficiency. However, how this transition occurred remains a significant and surprisingly understudied biological question. With a highly synchronized process involving numerous assembly factors, the biogenesis of thylakoid membranes suggests the existence of intermediate evolutionary states during the emergence of this compartment. Here, I propose a non-oxygenic origin of thylakoid membranes, where these intermediate states were initially dedicated to alternative electron flows. This hypothesis addresses the paradox of cyanobacterial diversification in an euxinic environment, which is toxic to photosystem II.</description>

      <title>Sampling probabilities, diffusions, ancestral graphs, and duality under strong selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wright-Fisher diffusions and their dual ancestral graphs occupy a central role in the study of allele frequency change and genealogical structure, and they provide expressions, explicit in some special cases but generally implicit, for the sampling probability, a crucial quantity in inference. Under a finite-allele mutation model, with possibly parent-dependent mutation, we consider the asymptotic regime where the selective advantage of one allele grows to infinity, while the other parameters remain fixed. In this regime, we show that the Wright-Fisher diffusion can be approximated either by a Gaussian process or by a process whose components are independent continuous-state branching processes with immigration, aligning with analogous results for Wright-Fisher models but employing different methods. While the first process becomes degenerate at stationarity, the latter does not and provides a simple, analytic approximation for the leading term of the sampling probability. Furthermore, using another approach based on a recursion formula, we characterise all remaining terms to provide a full asymptotic expansion for the sampling probability. Finally, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the rates of the block-counting process of the conditional ancestral selection graph and establish an asymptotic duality relationship between this and the diffusion.</description>
