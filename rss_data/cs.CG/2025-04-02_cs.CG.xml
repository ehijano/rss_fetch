      <title>Matching random colored points with rectangles (Corrigendum)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $n&gt;0$, let $S\subset [0,1]^2$ be a set of $n$ points, chosen uniformly at random. Let $R\cup B$ be a random partition, or coloring, of $S$ in which each point of $S$ is included in $R$ uniformly at random with probability $1/2$. Corujo et al.~(JOCO 2023) studied the random variable $M(n)$ equal to the number of points of $S$ that are covered by the rectangles of a maximum matching of $S$ using pairwise-disjoint rectangles. Each rectangle is axis-aligned and covers exactly two points of $S$ of the same color. They designed a deterministic algorithm to match points of $S$, and the algorithm was modeled as a discrete stochastic process over a finite set of states. After claiming that the stochastic process is a Markov chain, they proved that almost surely $M(n)\ge 0.83\,n$ for $n$ large enough. The issue is that such a process is not actually a Markov one, as we discuss in this note. We argue this issue, and correct it by obtaining the same result but considering that the stochastic process is not Markov, but satisfies some kind of first-order homogeneity property that allows us to compute its marginal distributions.</description>

      <title>Skeletonization Quality Evaluation: Geometric Metrics for Point Cloud Analysis in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skeletonization is a powerful tool for shape analysis, rooted in the inherent instinct to understand an object's morphology. It has found applications across various domains, including robotics. Although skeletonization algorithms have been studied in recent years, their performance is rarely quantified with detailed numerical evaluations. This work focuses on defining and quantifying geometric properties to systematically score the skeletonization results of point cloud shapes across multiple aspects, including topological similarity, boundedness, centeredness, and smoothness. We introduce these representative metric definitions along with a numerical scoring framework to analyze skeletonization outcomes concerning point cloud data for different scenarios, from object manipulation to mobile robot navigation. Additionally, we provide an open-source tool to enable the research community to evaluate and refine their skeleton models. Finally, we assess the performance and sensitivity of the proposed geometric evaluation methods from various robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Co-design Optimization of Moving Parts for Compliance and Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design requirements for moving parts in mechanical assemblies are typically specified in terms of interactions with other parts. Some are purely kinematic (e.g., pairwise collision avoidance) while others depend on physics and material properties (e.g., deformation under loads). Kinematic design methods and physics-based shape/topology optimization (SO/TO) deal separately with these requirements. They rarely talk to each other as the former uses set algebra and group theory while the latter requires discretizing and solving differential equations. Hence, optimizing a moving part based on physics typically relies on either neglecting or pruning kinematic constraints in advance, e.g., by restricting the design domain to a collision-free space using an unsweep operation. In this paper, we show that TO can be used to co-design two or more parts in relative motion to simultaneously satisfy physics-based criteria and collision avoidance. We restrict our attention to maximizing linear-elastic stiffness while penalizing collision measures aggregated in time. We couple the TO loops for two parts in relative motion so that the evolution of each part's shape is accounted for when penalizing collision for the other part. The collision measures are computed by a correlation functional that can be discretized by left- and right-multiplying the shape design variables by a pre-computed matrix that depends solely on the motion. This decoupling is key to making the computations scalable for TO iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with 2D and 3D examples.</description>

      <title>Crossing number inequalities for curves on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, as $m$ grows, any family of $m$ homotopically distinct closed curves on a surface induces a number of crossings that grows at least like $(m \log m)^2$. We use this to answer two questions of Pach, Tardos and Toth related to crossing numbers of drawings of multigraphs where edges are required to be non-homotopic. Furthermore, we generalize these results, obtaining effective bounds with optimal growth rates on every orientable surface.</description>

      <title>Strongly sublinear separators and bounded asymptotic dimension for sphere intersection graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the class $\mathcal{C}^d$ of sphere intersection graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \geq 2$. We show that for each integer $t$, the class of all graphs in $\mathcal{C}^d$ that exclude $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph has strongly sublinear separators. We also prove that $\mathcal{C}^d$ has asymptotic dimension at most $2d+2$.</description>

      <title>3D POLYLLA: Polyhedral meshing algorithm based on terminal-edge regions and terminal-face regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polylla is a polygonal mesh algorithm that generates meshes with arbitrarily shaped polygons using the concept of terminal-edge regions. Until now, Polylla has been limited to 2D meshes, but in this work, we extend Polylla to 3D volumetric meshes. We present two versions of Polylla 3D. The first version generates terminal-edge regions, converts them into polyhedra, and repairs polyhedra that are joined by only an edge. This version differs from the original Polylla algorithm in that it does not have the same phases as the 2D version. In the second version, we define two new concepts: longest-face propagation path and terminal-face regions. We use these concepts to create an almost direct extension of the 2D Polylla mesh with the same three phases: label phase, traversal phase, and repair phase.</description>
