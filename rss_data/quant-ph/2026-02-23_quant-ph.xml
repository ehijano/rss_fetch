      <title>A dimension-independent strict submultiplicativity for the transposition map in diamond norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exists an absolute constant $\alpha&lt;1$ such that for every finite dimension $d$ and every quantum channel $T$ on $\mathsf{L}(\mathbb{C}^d)$, $\left\|\Theta\circ(\mathrm{id}-T)\right\|_\diamond \le \alpha\,\left\|\Theta\right\|_\diamond\,\left\|\mathrm{id}-T\right\|_\diamond$, where $\Theta$ is the transposition map. In fact we show the explicit choice $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$ works.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundary Time Crystal Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary time crystals (BTCs) break time-translation symmetry and exhibit long-lived, robust oscillations insensitive to initial conditions. We show that collective spin BTCs can admit emergent topological winding numbers in operator space. Expanding the density operator in a spherical tensor basis, we map the Lindblad dynamics onto an effective local hopping problem, where collective degrees of freedom label sites of an emergent two-dimensional operator space lattice and identify topological obstructions that enforce the delocalization of operator modes on the lattice. The resulting spectral delocalization provides a natural explanation for the robust oscillatory dynamics observed in BTCs. When combined with non-reciprocal transport of operator weight across operator space, this mechanism moreover also leads to the universality of long-time dynamics across a broad class of initial states. Our results frame BTC dynamics as a form of topologically constrained operator space transport and suggest a close connection to non-Hermitian skin-effects.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum decision diagrams with scaling guarantees for Clifford+$T$ circuits and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decision diagram (DD) is a graph-like data structure for homomorphic compression of Boolean and pseudo-Boolean functions. Over the past decades, decision diagrams have been successfully applied to verification, linear algebra, stochastic reasoning, and quantum circuit analysis. Floating-point errors have, however, significantly slowed down practical implementations of real- and complex-valued decision diagrams. In the context of quantum computing, attempts to mitigate this numerical instability have thus far lacked theoretical scaling guarantees and have had only limited success in practice. Here, we focus on the analysis of quantum circuits consisting of Clifford gates and $T$ gates (a common universal gate set). We first hand-craft an algebraic representation for complex numbers, which replace the floating point coefficients in a decision diagram. Then, we prove that the sizes of these algebraic representations are linearly bounded in the number of $T$ gates and qubits, and constant in the number of Clifford gates. Furthermore, we prove that both the runtime and the number of nodes of decision diagrams are upper bounded as $2^t \cdot poly(g, n)$, where $t$ ($g$) is the number of $t$ gates (Clifford gates) and $n$ the number of qubits. Our proofs are based on a $T$-count dependent characterization of the density matrix entries of quantum states produced by circuits with Clifford+$T$ gates, and uncover a connection between a quantum state's stabilizer nullity and its decision diagram width. With an open source implementation, we demonstrate that our exact method resolves the inaccuracies occurring in floating-point-based counterparts and can outperform them due to lower node counts. Our contributions are, to the best of our knowledge, the first scaling guarantees on the runtime of (exact) quantum decision diagram simulation for a universal gate set.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Adiabaticity via Adaptive Quantum Zeno Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.</description>

      <title>Manipulating heterogeneous quantum resources over a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing relies on a variety of resources, including entanglement, coherence, non-Gaussianity, and magic. In realistic settings, protocols run on networks of parties with heterogeneous local resource constraints, so different resources coexist and interact. Yet, resource theories have mostly treated each resource in isolation, and a general theory for manipulation in such distributed settings has been lacking. We develop a unified framework for composite quantum resource theories that describes distributed networks of locally constrained parties. We formulate natural axioms a composite theory should satisfy to respect the local structure, and from these axioms derive fundamental bounds on resource manipulation that hold universally, independent of the particular network characteristics. We apply our results to central operational tasks, including resource conversion and assisted distillation, and introduce new methods to construct new resource monotones from this setup. Our framework further reveals previously unexplored phenomena in the remote certification of quantum resources. Together, these results establish foundational laws for distributed quantum resource manipulation across diverse physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of the Holstein-Primakoff Transformation on Noisy Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body systems offers a powerful approach to exploring collective quantum dynamics beyond classical computational reach. Although spin and fermionic models have been extensively simulated on digital quantum computers, the simulation of bosonic systems on programmable quantum processors is often hindered by the intrinsically large Hilbert space of bosonic modes. In this work, we study the digital quantum simulation of bosonic modes using the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation and implement this protocol on a cloud-based superconducting quantum processor. Two representative models are realized on quantum hardware: (i) the driven harmonic oscillator and (ii) the Jaynes-Cummings model. Using data obtained from the quantum simulations, we systematically examine the interplay between algorithmic and hardware-induced errors to identify optimal simulation parameters. The dominant algorithmic errors arise from the finite number of qubits used in the HP mapping and the finite number of Trotter steps in the time evolution, while hardware errors mainly originate from gate infidelity, decoherence, and readout errors. This study advances the digital quantum simulation of many-body systems involving bosonic degrees of freedom on currently available cloud quantum processors and provides a framework that can be extended to more complex spin-boson and multimode cavity models.</description>

      <title>Quantum superresolution and noise spectroscopy with quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology of an incoherent signal is a canonical sensing problem related to superresolution and noise spectroscopy. We show that quantum computing can accelerate searches for a weak incoherent signal when the signal and noise are not precisely known. In particular, we consider weak Schur sampling, density matrix exponentiation, and quantum signal processing for testing the rank, purity, and spectral gap of the unknown quantum state to detect the incoherent signal. We show that these algorithms are faster than full-state tomography, which scales with the dimension of the Hilbert space. We apply our results to detecting exoplanets, stochastic gravitational waves, ultralight dark matter, geontropic quantum gravity, and Pauli noise.</description>

      <title>Measuring and correcting nanosecond pulse distortions in quantum-dot spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots utilize fast electrical control to manipulate spin and charge states of individual electrons. Electrical pulse distortions can limit control fidelities but are difficult to measure at the device level. Here, we use detuning-axis pulsed spectroscopy to characterize baseband pulse distortions in a silicon double quantum-dot. We extract the gate-voltage impulse response and apply a digital pre-distortion filter to eliminate pulse distortions on timescales longer than 1~ns. With the pre-distortion, we reduce the frequency chirp of coherent exchange oscillations in a singlet-triplet qubit. Our results suggest a scalable and tuning-efficient method for characterizing pulse distortions in quantum-dot spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Comparison of security mechanisms of Mathematical cipher, Wyner scheme, QKD, and Quantum stream cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new generation of global communications technology has been emerging. These systems, which utilize established device technologies and quantum effect devices, require ultra-high speeds, low cost, and strong security. In recent years, global communication systems have faced various practical security challenges depending on their configurations, and research efforts are underway to address these issues. In particular, the issue of the security of physical layer security from microwave wireless systems to quantum optical communication systems is urgent problem. However, concepts of cryptographic schemes have also been diversifying. Typical examples are mathematical ciphers, the Wyner scheme and QKD. Then, the Y-00 protocol has recently emerged as a third pillar cryptographic technology in the optical quantum domain. These security principles differ significantly from one another. This makes it difficult for different fields to understand each other. At this stage, comparative explanations of the security principles underlying these various cryptographic technologies are likely to promote mutual understanding among researchers across different fields. As the first trial, this lecture note explains the security mechanism of the third pillar (Y-00), comparing it with the principles of other mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Distributed Hyperbolic Floquet Codes under Depolarizing and Erasure Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributing qubits across quantum processing units (QPUs) connected by shared entanglement enables scaling beyond monolithic architectures. Hyperbolic Floquet codes use only weight-2 measurements and are good candidates for distributed quantum error correcting codes. We construct hyperbolic and semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations via the Wythoff kaleidoscopic construction with the Low-Index Normal Subgroups (LINS) algorithm and distribute them across QPUs via spectral bisection. The $\{10,3\}$ and $\{12,3\}$ families are new to hyperbolic Floquet codes.
  We simulate these distributed codes under four noise models: depolarizing, SDEM3, correlated EM3, and erasure. With depolarizing noise ($p_{\text{local}} = 0.03\%$), fine-grained codes achieve non-local pseudo-thresholds up to 3.0\% for $\{8,3\}$, 3.0\% for $\{10,3\}$, and 1.75\% for $\{12,3\}$. Correlated EM3 yields pseudo-thresholds up to 0.75\% for $\{8,3\}$, 0.75\% for $\{10,3\}$, and 0.50\% for $\{12,3\}$; crossing-based thresholds from same-$k$ families are ${\sim}1.75$--$2.9\%$ across all tessellations. Using the SDEM3 model, fine-grained codes achieve distributed pseudo-thresholds of 1.75\% for $\{8,3\}$, 1.25\% for $\{10,3\}$, and 1.00\% for $\{12,3\}$. Under erasure noise motivated by spin-optical architectures, thresholds at 1\% local loss are 35--40\% for $\{8,3\}$, 30--35\% for $\{10,3\}$, and 25--30\% for $\{12,3\}$.</description>

      <title>Recursive Sketched Interpolation: Efficient Hadamard Products of Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hadamard product of two tensors in the tensor-train (TT) format is a fundamental operation across various applications, such as TT-based function multiplication for nonlinear differential equations or convolutions. However, conventional methods for computing this product typically scale as at least $\mathcal{O}(\chi^4)$ with respect to the TT bond dimension (TT-rank) $\chi$, creating a severe computational bottleneck in practice. By combining randomized tensor-train sketching with slice selection via interpolative decomposition, we introduce Recursive Sketched Interpolation (RSI), a ``scale product'' algorithm that computes the Hadamard product of TTs at a computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(\chi^3)$. Benchmarks across various TT scenarios demonstrate that RSI offers superior scalability compared to traditional methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. We generalize RSI to compute more complex operations, including Hadamard products of multiple TTs and other element-wise nonlinear mappings, without increasing the complexity beyond $\mathcal{O}(\chi^3)$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Maximum Independent Set Preparation with Rydberg Atoms Guided by the Spectral Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computation with Rydberg atoms provides a natural route for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the maximum independent set (MIS). However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the reduction of the spectral gap with increasing system size and connectivity, which induces population leakage from the ground state during finite-time evolution. Here we introduce the Adjusted Detuning for Ground-Energy Leakage Blockade (ADGLB), a spectral-gap-guided schedule engineering method that modifies the laser detuning profile to suppress leakage without introducing additional Hamiltonian terms or iterative optimization loops. We experimentally benchmark ADGLB on a quasi-one-dimensional chain of $N=10$ atoms, and the MIS preparation probability increases substantially compared with the standard adiabatic schedule. Furthermore, we show that the schedule optimized for smaller instances can be directly applied to larger two-dimensional triangular lattices with $N=25$ and $N=37$. With a small heuristic offset, the method also remains effective for instances with higher hardness parameters. These findings demonstrate that spectral-gap-guided schedule engineering offers a scalable and hardware-efficient strategy for enhancing adiabatic quantum optimization on neutral-atom platforms.</description>

      <title>A Tailored Fidelity Estimation and Purification Method for Entangled Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to conduct both quantum state reconstruction and entanglement purification simultaneously that is advantageous in several respects over previous work in this direction, showing that the number of Bell pairs necessary to boot a quantum network can be significantly reduced compared to an existing method. The existing method requires at least $10^5$ Bell pairs for the state reconstruction phase to estimate that the state is of fidelity $0.99$ within the error range of $10^{-2}$, whereas our approach only requires around $2,841$ to be certain with $99.7\%$ of confidence that the estimated fidelity lies within $[0.99-0.01, 0.99+0.01]$. In addition, in our approach we can start with a lower fidelity Bell pair and purify it multiple times, estimating at the same time the resultant fidelity with guarantee of $99.7\%$ that the fidelity estimate lies within a certain range. Moreover, the existing method cannot correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors at the same time and can only correct one of these, whereas our approach can correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously. This research produces numerical estimates for the number of Bell pairs actually needed to guarantee a certain threshold fidelity $F$. The research can support the functioning real-world quantum networking by providing the information of the time needed for the bootstrapping of a quantum network to finish.</description>

      <title>Separating Non-Interactive Classical Verification of Quantum Computation from Falsifiable Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mahadev [SIAM J. Comput. 2022] introduced the first protocol for classical verification of quantum computation based on the Learning-with-Errors (LWE) assumption, achieving a 4-message interactive scheme. This breakthrough naturally raised the question of whether fewer messages are possible in the plain model. Despite its importance, this question has remained unresolved.
  In this work, we prove that there is no quantum black-box reduction of non-interactive classical verification of quantum computation of $\textsf{QMA}$ to any falsifiable assumption. Here, "non-interactive" means that after an instance-independent setup, the protocol consists of a single message. This constitutes a strong negative result given that falsifiable assumptions cover almost all standard assumptions used in cryptography, including LWE. Our separation holds under the existence of a $\textsf{QMA} \text{-} \textsf{QCMA}$ gap problem. Essentially, these problems require a slightly stronger assumption than $\textsf{QMA}\neq \textsf{QCMA}$. To support the existence of such problems, we present a construction relative to a quantum unitary oracle.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Dynamical Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard quantum state tomography assumes sufficient control of a system to measure an informationally complete set of observables. Dynamical quantum state tomography (DQST) presents an alternative: given a system with known dynamics and a single fixed observable, it almost always suffices to control only the time at which each i.i.d. copy of the system is measured. This work presents an analogous scheme for tomography of multi-mode Bosonic Gaussian states undergoing Gaussian evolution, using a fixed single-mode homodyne measurement and only assuming control of the time of measurement. I prove that the scheme enables tomography for all discrete homogenous Gaussian evolutions and Gaussian quantum dynamical semigroups except for a null set which includes unitary evolution. When the state is known to be pure, a smaller number of measurement times is shown to be sufficient.</description>

      <title>Pulsed coherent spectroscopy of a quantum emitter in hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in solid-state systems constitute a promising platform for the realization of deterministic quantum emitters. Among many candidate materials and emitters, point defects in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) have recently emerged as particularly promising. In this work, we probe the coherence of an individual B center with a zero phonon line at 436 nm, under pulsed resonant excitation. We observe power-dependent Rabi oscillations up to 5{\pi}, demonstrating optical coherent control of the transition. We achieve an excellent single photon purity of 93% at {\pi}-pulse. Furthermore, we probe the coherence of the two-level system using Ramsey interferometry, revealing an inhomogeneous coherence time of T_2*=0.60 ns. These results establish B centers in hBN as viable candidates for triggered, coherent quantum emitters and represent an important step towards their integration into quantum photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Polariton-polariton coherent coupling in a molecular spin-superconductor chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to establish coherent communication channels is key for scaling up quantum devices. Here, we engineer interactions between distant polaritons, hybrid spin-photon excitations formed at different lumped-element superconducting resonators within a chip. The chip consists of several resonator pairs, slightly detuned in frequency to make them addressable, capacitively coupled within each pair and inductively coupled to a common readout line. They interact locally with samples of PTMr and Tripak$^{-}$ organic free radicals, deposited onto their inductors, which provide model $S = 1/2$, $g \simeq 2$ spin ensembles. Frequency-dependent microwave transmission experiments, performed at very low temperatures, measure polariton frequencies as a function of magnetic field in different scenarios. When only one resonator within a pair hosts a molecular sample, the results evidence that spins couple remotely to the empty LER as well as to the local cavity mode. If both resonators interact with a spin ensemble, the magnetic field tunes the polariton frequencies relative to each other, on account of the different spin-photon interactions at each LER. When polaritons are brought into mutual resonance, an avoided level crossing emerges that gives direct spectroscopic evidence for a coherent polariton-polariton interaction mediated by the circuit. Pump-probe experiments reveal that the excitation of a polariton within a connected pair is felt, thus it can be read out, by the other one. These observations, backed by model calculations, illustrate the control and detection of distant photon-photon and spin-spin correlations and entanglement in a scalable modular chip.</description>

      <title>Directional Dynamics of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical consequences of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) remain largely unexplored despite extensive studies of its static properties. Here we address this gap by applying quantum Liang information flow (QLIF) an inherently directional measure of causal influence to the nonHermitian Su Schrieffer Heeger model with non reciprocal hopping. Unlike symmetric correlation functions, QLIF directly captures the directional asymmetry characteristic of non reciprocal systems. We demonstrate a scissors effect where the asymmetry varies approximately linearly with the non-reciprocity parameter gamma for small gamma, and exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the skin length, with optimal asymmetry at moderate skin localization. The velocity ordering reveals NHSE-induced blocking of information flow against the skin direction. Three distinct temporal regimes emerge: light-cone-bounded spreading, gamma-dependent stabilization, and coherent oscillations. These results establish the first quantitative connection between static skin localization and directional information dynamics, offering new insights into information propagation in non-reciprocal quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Flux-Activated Resonant Control of a Bosonic Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal control of bosonic degrees of freedom provides a hardware-efficient route for quantum information processing with high-dimensional systems. Bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), which leverages transmon ancillae to coherently control long-lived superconducting cavities, is well suited to this goal. However, the cavity transitions are nearly degenerate in the usual dispersive regime, which limits the direct addressability of individual excitation levels and increases the complexity of engineered gates. Here, we integrate an on-chip flux-control architecture with a long-lived bosonic memory housed in a 3D superconducting cavity to dynamically access resonant Jaynes-Cummings (JC) interactions, and realize efficient arbitrary rotations between any pair of Fock levels in the memory. This on-demand access to JC interactions offers a versatile toolbox for implementing robust Fock-basis qudits and harnessing the rich dynamics of high-dimensional bosonic elements for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Clock Synchronization with Weakly Correlated Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clock synchronization is necessary for communication and distributed computing tasks. Previous schemes based on photon timing correlations use pulsed light or photon pairs for their strong timing correlations. In this work, we demonstrate successful synchronization of crystal clocks using weakly time-correlated photons of 180 ns coherence time from a bunched light source. A synchronization timing jitter of 10 ns is achieved over symmetric -102 dB optical channel loss between two parties, over a span of 25 hours. We also present a model that gives better estimates to the coherence peak finding success probabilities under low signal.</description>

      <title>High-quality single photons from cavity-enhanced biexciton-to-exciton transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant laser excitation of a two-level system with subsequent single-photon emission can be used to generate single photons with high indistinguishability or Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) visibility. However, spectral overlap between excitation laser and emitted photons generally poses significant challenges. Furthermore, emitter re-excitation intrinsically limits achievable single-photon purity. Established solutions mitigate these issues at significant cost to source efficiency and with increased source complexity. This motivates the use of few-level systems with spectral separation of excitation and emission pathways. One option is a three-level cascade. However, without targeted lifetime engineering of emitting states, the cascade naturally limits achievable photon indistinguishability. Here we study a semiconductor quantum dot with resonant and selective cavity-enhancement of biexciton-to-exciton transition. Following resonant two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, we collect the emitted single photon with the cavity. This approach circumvents emitter re-excitation and naturally introduces spectral separation of excitation laser and emitted single photon. Supported by first experimental results, we demonstrate theoretically that with selective Purcell enhancement, the observed quality quantifiers of single-photon emission (purity, equivalently $g^{(2)}(0)$, and HOM visibility $\mathcal{V}$, equivalently indistinguishability) are competitive with respect to high-quality deterministic quantum-dot single-photon sources. This is already achieved without systematic optimization or targeted system engineering, which firmly places the reported approach as a viable route to the next generation of highest-quality quantum-dot based deterministic single-photon sources.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference with Finite Coincidence Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a fundamental tool for assessing photon indistinguishability in quantum information processing. While the effect of chromatic dispersion on HOM interference has been widely studied, the interplay between dispersion and the finite detection window of realistic measurement devices remains under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the rectangular coincidence window inherent to modern time-tagging modules, which effectively acts as a temporal filter, breaks the standard dispersion cancellation condition and restores sensitivity to symmetric group velocity dispersion. We derive an analytical model for type-II SPDC processes that predicts a modification of the HOM dip shape, specifically the emergence of characteristic oscillations and dip broadening. We experimentally validate this theoretical framework using a ppKTP source and transmission through optical fibers of lengths up to 29 km. The experimental data show excellent agreement with the model, confirming the presence of window-induced oscillations and allowing for the precise extraction of the fiber dispersion parameter. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for finite timing resolution in the design and characterization of dispersive quantum communication links.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of a photonic weighted graph state for quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology seeks to push the boundaries of measurement precision by harnessing quantum phenomena. Conventional methods often rely on maximally entangled resources, with states that are usually challenging to produce and sustain in practical setups. Here, we show that the maximally entangled constraint can be lifted by experimentally realizing a photonic two-qubit weighted graph state with an arbitrarily tunable graph weight. We use the generated state as a resource for quantum-enhanced phase sensing. We experimentally characterize the state and study its minimum estimator variance for two distinct local measurement bases as the graph weight varies from the maximally entangled to weakly entangled limit. We find excellent quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions, and observe a gain in precision beyond the classically attainable precision limit for graph weights substantially below the maximally entangled limit. This confirms that considerably less entanglement is required to achieve a quantum advantage. Albeit non-scalable in our test setup, this work represents the first experimental realization of weighted graph states with a tunable graph weight using linear optics. We expect more scalable versions of the model to be possible in an on-chip photonic platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving near-unity fidelity in conventional continuous-variable quantum teleportation schemes based on two-mode squeezed vacuum states is fundamentally unattainable. To overcome this limitation, alternative approaches utilizing ensembles of two-dimensional entangled qubits have been proposed. In this work, we investigate continuous-variable quantum teleportation employing entangled qutrit resources under realistic noise effects. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well in both ideal and noisy conditions, enabling high-fidelity teleportation with a reasonable success probability.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spatial photon interference versus dipole blockade effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady-state quantum dynamics of three dipole-dipole coupled two-level emitters, fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and interacting via the environmental thermostat is investigated. We have analytically obtained the populations of the involved three-atom cooperative states as well as of the second- and third-order spatial photon correlation functions of the light scattered by the few-qubit sample. As a consequence, we have demonstrated that this incoherently excited system spontaneously generates streams of single photons possessing sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In analogy to the dipole-dipole blockade, one may expect that at smaller inter particle distances, compared to the photon emission wavelength, the reported phenomenon has the same origin. However, we have shown that the quantum photon features are due to the interaction's nature of the few symmetrically arranged two-level emitters with the surrounding thermal reservoir. Respectively, at larger atomic intervals the effect occurs because of high-order spatial interference phenomena. Sub-wavelength interference fringes can be observed too, via measurements of spatial higher-order photon correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of Refrigeration and Engine Operation in Minimal Qubit Repeated-Interaction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the operation of a qubit as a quantum thermal device within the repeated interaction framework, allowing for strong system-bath coupling and finite interaction times. We analyze two minimal models: an alternating-coupling setup, in which the qubit sequentially interacts with hot and cold baths, and a simultaneous-coupling setup, where both baths interact with the qubit during each collision. For the alternating model, we obtain an exact analytical solution for the limit-cycle state, valid for arbitrary coupling strengths and collision durations. Using this solution, we rigorously prove a no-go theorem for quantum refrigeration. We further demonstrate that, although work can be generated locally at individual system-bath contacts, the total work over a cycle is always nonpositive, precluding engine operation. In the absence of work, the model describes pure heat conduction, for which we derive a closed-form expression for the heat current and show that it exhibits a nonmonotonic turnover behavior. The simultaneous-coupling model is analyzed perturbatively. In the short-collision-time limit, it reproduces the same steady-state behavior as the alternating model, reinforcing the generality of the constraints identified. Our results establish fundamental limitations on qubit-based quantum thermal machines operating under Markovian repeated interactions and highlight the need for enriched models to realize functional quantum thermal devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consolidate coherence, athermality, and nonuniformity as sub-resources within an underlying quantum resource theory: instability. We formulate instability axiomatically as the transient information within a decaying physical system. Specifying a decay mechanism (e.g., dephasing, thermalization) recovers these familiar resources as specific manifestations of instability. We compute the one-shot distillation yield and dilution cost in various operational paradigms, and use them to pin down the extremal additive monotones. In the asymptotic regime, we show that all conversion rates are governed by a single additive monotone, and thereby we establish a universal second law for instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fragility of quantum coherence fundamentally limits the scalability of quantum technologies, as unavoidable environmental interactions induce decoherence and rapidly degrade quantum properties. The Quantum Zeno Effect offers a powerful route to suppress quantum evolution and protect coherence through frequent measurements, irrespective of the underlying dynamics. However, existing implementations require prior knowledge of the quantum state, severely restricting their applicability. Here we introduce a state- and dynamics-independent protection protocol embedding the system in a larger Hilbert space, temporarily swapping the quantum information from its original degree of freedom to a decoherence-free ancillary one. We experimentally validate the protocol on a quantum optical platform, demonstrating robust preservation of coherence and purity for arbitrary polarization qubits under decoherence, thereby enabling the universal safeguarding of unknown quantum states.</description>

      <title>A Fine-Grained and Efficient Reliability Analysis Framework for Noisy Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the reliability of noisy quantum circuits is essential for implementing quantum algorithms on noisy quantum devices. However, current quantum hardware exhibits diverse noise mechanisms whose compounded effects make accurate and efficient reliability evaluation challenging. While state fidelity is the most faithful indicator of circuit reliability, it is experimentally and computationally prohibitive to obtain. Alternative metrics, although easier to compute, often fail to accurately reflect circuit reliability, lack universality across circuit types, or offer limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable framework for efficient and accurate reliability evaluation of noisy quantum circuits. Our approach performs a state-independent analysis to model how circuit reliability progressively degrades during execution. We introduce the Noise Proxy Circuit (NPC), which removes all logical operations while preserving the complete sequence of noise channels, thereby providing an abstraction of cumulative noise effects. Based on the NPC, we define Proxy Fidelity, a reliability metric that quantifies both qubit-level and circuit-level reliability. We further develop an analytical algorithm to estimate Proxy Fidelity under depolarizing, thermal relaxation, and readout error channels. The proposed framework achieves fidelity-level reliability estimation while remaining execution-free, scalable, and interpretable. Experimental results show that our method accurately estimates circuit fidelity, with an average absolute difference (AAD) ranging from 0.031 to 0.069 across diverse circuits and devices.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the application of a quantum feature extraction method to enhance multi-class image classification for space applications. By harnessing the dynamics of many-body spin Hamiltonians, the method generates expressive quantum features that, when combined with classical processing, lead to quantum-enhanced classification accuracy. Using a strong and well-established ResNet50 baseline, we achieved a maximum classical accuracy of 83%, which can be improved to 84% with a transfer learning approach. In contrast, applying our quantum-classical method the performance is increased to 87% accuracy, demonstrating a clear and reproducible improvement over robust classical approaches. Implemented on several of IBM's quantum processors, our hybrid quantum-classical approach delivers consistent gains of 2-3% in absolute accuracy. These results highlight the practical potential of current and near-term quantum processors in high-stakes, data-driven domains such as satellite imaging and remote sensing, while suggesting broader applicability in real-world machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced phase sensitivity in an all-fiber Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum photonics have enabled increasingly robust protocols in optical phase estimation, achieving precisions beyond the standard quantum limit and approaching the Heisenberg limit. While intrinsic losses hinder the realization of unconditional super-sensitivity, reaching quantum advantage, defined as sensitivity surpassing that of any classical counterpart with identical resources, remains achievable. Here we experimentally demonstrate such an advantage using a fully fibered Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer operating at telecom wavelengths, free of post-selection. The scheme relies on the conversion of polarization-entangled photon pairs, a degree of freedom commonly favored for experimental convenience, into energy-time entanglement, which is particularly well suited for scalable fiber-based sensors. All system imperfections, including asymmetric losses and detector inefficiencies, are accounted for in the Fisher information analysis, yielding a measured quantum advantage of 10%. This result highlights the practicality of compact, alignment-free quantum interferometers for real-world sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Improving Single Excitation Fidelity in Rydberg Superatoms for Efficient Single Photon Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic single photon emission from a Rydberg ensemble coupled to an optical cavity requires high-fidelity preparation of collective single excitations. In such a setup imperfect Rydberg blockade can lead to unwanted double excitations, which degrade photon indistinguishability. In this work we adapt the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) technique, originally developed for superconducting qubits, to shape optical pulses that suppress double excitations in this atomic platform. By combining analytical modeling with numerical optimization, DRAG provides an improvement over conventional sine-squared pulses. Further optimization of pulse duration and atomic ensemble size identifies a parameter regime, distinct from that used in [Nature Photonics 17, 688 (2023)], that enhances the single excitation probability from the previous theoretical benchmark of 77% to 91.9%, approaching the fundamental limits set by decoherence in the system. Benchmarking against GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) confirms that DRAG operates close to the optimal control limit, while maintaining smooth, experimentally feasible pulse shapes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cross platform adaptability of DRAG for a high-fidelity single photon source.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable multi-qubit optimal control via interaction decomposition in the diagonal frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a general n-qubit formulation of control objectives that allows a control target to be specified in a diagonal frame, so that only the diagonal entries must be characterized, thus quadratically reducing the complexity of the cost functional in constrast to a full target matrix. We do so by representing any n-qubit unitary transformation as a diagonal phase map on the computational basis states, as they are naturally diagonalizable by unitarity. By using discrete derivative operators to analytically construct support-selective phase invariants, we enable to deterministically isolate and quantify any multi-qubit interactions encoded in the phase map. These phase invariants form a coordinate system for the formulation of specific control targets in terms of arbitrary desired multi-qubit interactions, without having to invert the diagonalization during the optimizatiion, solely relying on the experimentally accesible diagonal phases. To illustrate the framework, we synthesize two genuinely tripartite entangling gates, both, diagonal and non-diagonal. These are obtained with a single shaped microwave pulse, for a numerically simulated room-temperature nitrogen-vacancy center with a three qubit nuclear spin register, with durations of about a microsecond. These results represent a factor 10-100 reduction in operation time compared with the fastest existing NV-based entanglers that act on more than two qubits at once.</description>

      <title>Theory and interpretability of Quantum Extreme Learning Machines: a Pauli-transfer matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) have emerged as a promising approach to quantum machine learning, since they utilize the natural dynamics of quantum systems for data processing and are simple to train. Here, we consider n-qubit quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) with continuous-time reservoir dynamics. QELMs are memoryless QRCs capable of various ML tasks, including image classification and time series forecasting. We apply the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) formalism to theoretically analyze the influence of encoding, reservoir dynamics, and measurement operations, including temporal multiplexing, on the QELM performance. This formalism makes explicit that the encoding determines the complete set of (nonlinear) features available to the QELM, while the quantum channels linearly transform these features before they are probed by the chosen measurement operators. Optimizing a QELM can therefore be cast as a decoding problem in which one shapes the channel-induced transformations such that task-relevant features become available to the regressor. The PTM formalism allows one to identify the classical representation of a QELM and thereby guide its design towards a given training objective. As a specific application, we focus on learning nonlinear dynamical systems and show that a QELM trained on such trajectories learns a surrogate-approximation to the underlying flow map.</description>

      <title>Bell-GHZ nonclassicality of many-observer interwoven frustrated down conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated down conversion is a process in which a quantum superposition of emissions from two separate parametric down-conversion processes gives rise to observable interference. Depending on the phase relation between the probability amplitudes associated with emissions by the first and second crystal, the process can be enhanced or suppressed. This is achieved by aligning the setup so that the signal and idler modes from the first crystal are fed into the second and constitute its signal-idler modes.
  In Sci. Adv. 11, 1794 (2025), two-observer interwoven frustrated PDC processes produced interference effects based on path identity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 080401 (2017)]. The signal and idler modes of source crystals I and II are arranged to fully overlap with the emission modes of crystals A and B, which serve as elements of measurement stations controlled by Alice and Bob. In the interwoven configuration, crystal A (B) receives the signal mode of crystal I (II) and the idler mode of crystal II (I), enabling interference between joint emission processes at the sources and at the measurement stations. It was conjectured that such interference may lead to new non-classical phenomena.
  In arXiv:2508.19207 it was shown that the process violates the standard Clauser-Horne Bell inequality without additional assumptions, provided suitable measurement settings are used. Here we extend the interference scheme to more than two measurement stations and demonstrate a violation of one of the WWWZB inequalities. This indicates that the proposed approach may provide a general method for revealing non-classicality in a range of phenomena discussed in [Rev. Mod. Phys. 94, 025007 (2022)]. We also present a GHZ/Hardy-type argument that further highlights the paradoxical character of the interference.</description>

      <title>Qubit error bursts in superconducting quantum processors of Quantum Inspire: quasiparticle pumping and anomalous time dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate qubit error bursts in 5- and 7-transmon processors of similar design, fabrication and packaging, but with different types of qubit Josephson junctions. Measurements for each are performed in two refrigerators to discern device-specific from refrigerator-dependent characteristics. The duration and rate of bursts are device specific but within the range of prior experiments and consistent with ionizing radiation. We observe two unforeseen signatures specifically in the processor with Dolan junctions. First, increasing the rate of $\pi$ pulsing in the detection scheme shortens the recovery time to equilibrium, which is explained by a quasiparticle pumping mechanism. The second signature is an anomalous time dependence in the burst rate: a surge happens days or weeks after cooldown, followed by a strong suppression that persists until thermal cycling.</description>

      <title>Participation Ratio as a Quantum Probe of Hierarchical Stickiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how quantum localization encodes the hierarchical stickiness that governs transport in mixed classical phase spaces. Using the periodically driven kicked top, we show that the participation ratio (PR) of coherent states in the Floquet eigenbasis resolves the same layered structure that appears classically as a multimodal distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs). To establish a quantitative correspondence, we introduce a Gaussian coarse graining of the FTLE matched to the intrinsic semiclassical resolution of coherent states. Both local correlations and global comparisons of probability distributions demonstrate that quantum and classical indicators agree optimally within a finite window of evolution times, where sticky structures are most clearly resolved. Our results promote the participation ratio from a global measure of chaos to a sensitive probe of hierarchical transport and provide a practical route for diagnosing anomalous localization in driven quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic tensor contraction for quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Field Theories with Boundaries in Curved Spacetimes Using Open Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to simulate quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries in $(1+1)$-dimenmsional curved spacetimes by employing open spin systems. Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Observation of Robust and Coherent Non-Abelian Hadron Dynamics on Noisy Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time evolution of strongly interacting matter remains a frontier of fundamental physics, as classical simulations are hampered by exponential Hilbert space growth and entanglement-driven bottlenecks in tensor networks. This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>A contour for the entanglement negativity of bosonic Gaussian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a contour function for the logarithmic negativity and the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix for multimode bosonic Gaussian states of a free lattice model. In one spatial dimension, numerical results are obtained for harmonic chains either in the ground state or at finite temperature, by considering, respectively, either a subsystem made by two adjacent or disjoint blocks on the line or a bipartition of the circle. The contour function of the logarithmic negativity diverges only at the entangling points, while the contour function for the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose is divergent also at the boundary of the bipartite subsystem, as functions of the position. In a two-dimensional conformal field theory, analytic expressions that describe these divergencies are discussed. In one spatial dimension, we explore the partial derivative of the logarithmic negativity of two adjacent intervals with respect to the logarithm of the harmonic ratio of their lengths while their ratio and the other parameters are kept fixed. Considering the ground state of the harmonic chain on the line and in the massive regime, we report numerical results showing that this quantity displays a monotonically decreasing behaviour.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine interaction as a probe of the microscopic structure of the atomic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of highly charged electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, provides an intriguing way to probe the internal structure of their atomic nuclei. In this work, we use nuclear structure calculations to accurately calculate the hyperfine splitting of electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, focusing in particular on the incorporation of finite-volume corrections, such as Bohr-Weisskopf and Breit-Rosenthal, due to the penetration of the electron and muon wavefunction into the nuclear electric charge and magnetic dipole densities. These corrections are essential for refining our understanding of the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Our simulations use a Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS model known for its effectiveness in modeling well-deformed nuclei such as ${}^{159}\mathrm{Tb}^{64+}$ and ${}^{165}\mathrm{Ho}^{66+}$, with particular emphasis on ${}^{161,163}\mathrm{Dy}^{65+}$ isotopes. It can also be generalised to multi-electron ions by studying the hyperfine anomaly between two isotopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent approach that provides an explicit potential for a Rydberg electron whose ionic core consists of a polarizable medium, typically realized with superfluid droplets. The electron's motion remains separable in spherical coordinates, but the radial force exerted by the droplet breaks degeneracy of the angular momentum states non-perturbatively. The ensuing electron spectrum reveals intriguing properties dependent on droplet size and electron excitation. Deviations of the polarizable medium from the continuous spherical distribution can be taken into account as a perturbation of this redefined Rydberg dynamics. We discuss specific but paradigmatic examples for superfluid helium and also propose a way to probe droplet properties including its possible crystallized fraction through stimulated transitions of the Rydberg electron.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases of moat-band excitons in two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems of interacting excitons with a moat dispersion, for which the ground-state energy manifold presents a ring of discrete or continuously degenerate minima around a single point in momentum space. At low densities and for an idealized, perfectly degenerate moat, we show that the excitons undergo statistical transmutation and stabilize a chiral spin liquid. At higher densities, the moat dispersion favors Bose-Einstein condensation into states occupying multiple momenta, leading to inhomogeneous condensate phases and potentially supersolidity. We discuss the impact of band-structure warping present in realistic systems and argue that it generically stabilizes Bose-condensed phases over the chiral spin liquid, and analyze the superfluid response of the former which is unconventional due to the moat band. We also demonstrate that a proper renormalization of the exciton-exciton interaction is essential for describing these phases, and show that even purely repulsive interactions can favor inhomogeneous condensates. To further explore inhomogeneous condensate phases, we employ a Gross-Pitaevskii framework with a pseudopotential approximation and map out the resulting phase diagram. We show that the presence of degenerate dispersion minima can drive supersolidity already at weak coupling, in contrast to systems with a standard parabolic dispersion. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of real excitonic systems and argue that moat-band-induced supersolidity can be within experimental reach for realistic values of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress and torsion distributions in the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress distributions in the deuteron are related to form factors of the asymmetric energy-momentum tensor through three-dimensional Fourier transforms. There are eleven such form factors, which we calculate in an impulse approximation. We compare the obtained form factors to prior results for the six form factors that have been previously calculated. We then elaborate on the formalism for relating the form factors to internal distributions of mass, mass flux, momentum, stresses, and forces, and obtain results for all of these distributions. We obtain the principal stresses for the symmetric part of the stress tensor, and show that the antisymmetric part describes reorientation of fermion spin by torsion stress when the nucleon moves between the S- and D-waves. Force distributions in the nucleons depend on the so-called non-conserved form factors through the Cauchy momentum equation, and are non-radial owing to the presence of tensor forces and spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Maximum Likelihood Prediction via Hilbert Space Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have proposed various explanations for the ability of modern large language models (LLMs) to perform in-context prediction. We propose an alternative conceptual viewpoint from an information-geometric and statistical perspective. Motivated by Bach[2023], we model training as learning an embedding of probability distributions into the space of quantum density operators, and in-context learning as maximum-likelihood prediction over a specified class of quantum models. We provide an interpretation of this predictor in terms of quantum reverse information projection and quantum Pythagorean theorem when the class of quantum models is sufficiently expressive. We further derive non-asymptotic performance guarantees in terms of convergence rates and concentration inequalities, both in trace norm and quantum relative entropy. Our approach provides a unified framework to handle both classical and quantum LLMs.</description>

Abstract: In the current era of quantum computing, robust and efficient tools are essential to bridge the gap between simulations and quantum hardware execution. In this work, we introduce a machine learning approach to characterize the noise impacting a quantum chip and emulate it during simulations. Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning, offering increased flexibility in reproducing various noise models compared to conventional techniques such as randomized benchmarking or heuristic noise models. The effectiveness of the RL agent has been validated through simulations and testing on real superconducting qubits. Additionally, we provide practical use-case examples for the study of renowned quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, understanding the interplay between locality, thermal constraints, and communication remains an open challenge. In this manuscript, we introduce Local Thermal Operations and Classical Communication (LTOCC), a novel operational framework that unifies the distant laboratories paradigm with thermodynamic restrictions, defining the fundamental limits on transformations between spatially separated systems. We establish a hierarchy of LTOCC protocols, demonstrating inclusion relations between different levels and revealing their deep connection to semilocal thermal operations. To formalize this framework, we develop thermal tensors and bithermal tensors, extending stochastic and tristochastic tensors to thermodynamic settings and providing new mathematical tools for constrained quantum processes. Finally, we present limitations imposed by LTOCC on single- and multi-copy CHSH scenario, demonstrating no violation in former and a gap between thermal and athermal local operations in the latter with respect to their capability to detect entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the metrological problem of estimating collective stochastic properties imprinted on a network of quantum sensors. Canonical examples include center-of-mass quadrature fluctuations in a system of bosonic modes and correlated dephasing in an ensemble of qubits (e.g., spins), bosons, or fermions. We develop a theoretical framework to determine the limits of correlated (weak) noise estimation with quantum sensor networks and reveal the requirements for entanglement advantage. Notably, an advantage emerges from the synergistic interplay between quantum correlations of the sensors and ``classical'' correlations of the noises. We determine optimal entangled probe states and identify a sensing protocol -- reminiscent of a many-body echo -- that achieves the fundamental limits of measurement sensitivity for a broad class of problems, unveiling a route towards entanglement-enhanced metrology of correlated many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Expediting quantum state transfer through the long-range extended XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range (LR) interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, improving the achievable fidelity, mitigating its slow decline as compared with the nearest-neighbor setting, associated with increasing system-size. Our study identifies the LR regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Furthermore, we exhibit that the presence of LR interactions considerably reduces the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computer Controlled by Superconducting Digital Electronics at Millikelvin Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current superconducting quantum computing platforms face significant scaling challenges, as individual signal lines are required for control of each qubit. This wiring overhead is a result of the low level of integration between control electronics at room temperature and qubits operating at millikelvin temperatures, which raise serious doubts among technologists about whether utility-scale quantum computers can be built. A promising alternative is to utilize cryogenic, superconducting digital control electronics that coexist with qubits. Here, we report the first multi-qubit system integrating this technology. The system utilizes digital demultiplexing, breaking the linear scaling of control lines to number of qubits. We also demonstrate single-qubit fidelities above 99%, and up to 99.9%. This work is a critical step forward in realizing highly scalable chip-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness generation in a multiparticle quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of non-stabilizerness, or magic, in a multi-particle quantum walk by analyzing the time evolution of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. Our study considers both single- and two-particle quantum walks in the framework of the XXZ Heisenberg model with varying interaction strengths. We demonstrate that the spread of magic follows the light-cone structure dictated by the system's dynamics, with distinct behaviors emerging in the easy-plane ($\Delta &lt; 1$) and easy-axis ($\Delta &gt; 1$) regimes. For $\Delta &lt; 1$, magic generation is primarily governed by single-particle dynamics, while for $\Delta &gt; 1$, doublon propagation dominates, resulting in a significantly slower growth of $M_2$. Furthermore, the magic exhibits logarithmic growth in time for both one and two-particle dynamics. Additionally, by examining the Pauli spectrum, we show that the statistical distribution of level spacings exhibits Poissonian behavior, independent of interaction strength or particle number. Our results shed light on the role of interactions on magic generation in a many-body system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally study the interaction between a cold atom cloud and many longitudinal modes of a high quality Fabry-Perot cavity, by measuring signatures of collective light shifts in the cavity transmission spectrum of an optical frequency comb probe. Using a resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect significant shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously, which is a direct manifestation of physics beyond the hitherto explored regime of cavity-cold atom interaction with only single or few longitudinal modes at a time. For the cavity mode closest to the atomic resonance, we demonstrate a bistability in the transmission spectrum, arising due to a combined coupling of the cloud to an external pump laser and a cavity mode probed by the optical frequency comb. These results provide a first step toward deeper exploration of multifrequency cavity quantum electrodynamics, where ultrashort pulsed sources could be used for optical manipulation, cooling and entanglement of cold atoms in a resonator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet time crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to induce transitions resonantly between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor. This allows for robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for various initial sensor preparations, including ground states and low- and high-correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. Our findings are presented for both linear and nonlinear response regimes and illustrated for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.</description>

      <title>Identification and properties of topological states in the bulk of quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, topological states localized within the bulk of the system have been numerically identified in quasicrystalline structures, termed bulk localized transport (BLT) states. These states exhibit properties different from edge states, one example being that the number of BLT states scales with system size, while the number of edge states scales with system perimeter. Here, we define a procedure to identify BLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and robustness analyses. Applying the procedure to the Hofstadter model on the Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic fluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of states, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of states. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that follows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal. Furthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the energy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such groups. The spatial localization of the states within a certain group can change depending on the Fermi energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact identity component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that negativity or a non-classically enhanced escape rate is necessary to increase an output-to-dissipation ratio beyond classical limitations and show that the requirements are basis-independent and stronger than quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.</description>

      <title>Background-Free Device-Independent Violations of Causal Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17075v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process-matrix framework describes quantum correlations without presupposing a global causal order, yet its standard formulation implicitly relies on background structure through a fixed Choi-Jamiolkowski identification of local input-output spaces. We analyze how such background assumptions can be treated operationally relative to a fixed device-independent interface defined by a causal game. We impose local-frame covariance, requiring invariance under independent actions of a physical symmetry group $G$ on each laboratory, thereby excluding symmetry-breaking background resources. Covariance induces a representation-theoretic decomposition into symmetry sectors and symmetry-invariant multiplicity subsystems, introducing physical degrees of freedom that lie outside the declared device-independent interface. We then analyze causal-inequality signatures at the level of interface-observable statistics and identify when symmetry-induced, interface-inaccessible degrees of freedom undermine device-independent certification. A certification is called background-free if it arises from a locally covariant implementation and does not rely on hidden control mediated by interface-excluded degrees of freedom. We prove that background-free certifications cannot yield device-independent violations of bipartite causal inequalities in the multiplicity-free regime or when all multiplicity subsystems are classical-classical (CC). Such violations necessarily require non-CC multiplicity, with a concrete sufficient route provided by input-output embeddability of an effective process-matrix structure into non-CC blocks. These results delineate which device-independent causal signatures remain certifiable once both symmetry-breaking background structure and interface-level hidden control are excluded.</description>

      <title>Improving initial-state-dependent quantum circuit optimization by introducing state labels</title>

Abstract: While the capabilities of quantum hardware have significantly advanced in recent years, executing quantum algorithms as quantum circuits at the lowest possible cost remains crucial, regardless of the hardware progress. We are developing a quantum-state-dependent circuit optimizer called AQCEL. Our guiding principle, implemented as the AQCEL optimization protocol, is to optimize quantum circuits by measuring the states of the control qubits to identify and eliminate unnecessary control operations. In this paper, we introduce two key improvements: the state label manager that reduces unnecessary state measurements and the $CX$-pair removal process that eliminates redundant gate pairs. These enhancements significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates, improving the fidelity of quantum circuits executed on quantum hardware. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply AQCEL to quantum circuits for the quantum parton shower algorithm. Experimental results using the IBM quantum computer show a substantial reduction in gate counts and an improvement in fidelity compared to the conventional optimization technique as well as the original AQCEL protocol. Our findings highlight the potential of state-dependent circuit optimization for enhancing the performance of quantum algorithms on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Improving QAOA to find approximate QUBO solutions in O(1) shots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a modified fixed-point version of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (fpQAOA), in which parameters are trained on small instances and transferred to larger problems. Our scheme combines three key ingredients: (i) targeting approximate rather than exact solutions through the success probability at a prescribed approximation ratio (AR), (ii) scaling the circuit depth linearly with the problem size using a two-parameter sin-cos angle encoding, and (iii) normalizing QUBO Hamiltonians by their Frobenius norm. Across several ensembles of random QUBO instances, we observe that these modifications yield a non-increasing (and often decreasing) median number of quantum circuit runs ("shots") required to achieve AR $\alpha=0.95$, while the per-shot complexity remains polynomial. Extrapolation indicates an effectively constant $O(1)$ sampling complexity under this combined fpQAOA construction. Strikingly, removing any single component of the scheme restores exponential growth in the number of required shots, highlighting the synergistic nature of the three modifications. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that fpQAOA can achieve scalable approximate performance with polynomial-depth circuits.</description>

      <title>Enabling full localization of qubits and gates with a multi-mode coupler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunable couplers are a key building block of superconducting quantum processors, enabling high on-off ratios for two-qubit entangling interactions. While qubit-qubit interaction can be turned off, residual wavefunctions delocalize single-qubit excitations over the device, yielding weak effective couplings that manifest as unintended crosstalk. Moreover, conventional single-mode couplers lack independent control over interactions in the one- and two-excitation manifolds, leading to unitary errors such as leakage during gate operations. Here, we propose a multi-mode tunable coupler that enforces complete localization, yielding near-perfect qubit isolation at the decoupled point. We further show that the additional degrees of freedom in the coupler enable independent and nonlinear control of effective interactions across distinct excitation manifolds, with large on-off ratios. This architecture provides a new route toward the next generation of couplers for scalable and high-fidelity gate operations in superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum approximate optimization of finite-state bosonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist numerous problems in nature inherently described by finite $D$-dimensional states. Formulating these problems for execution on qubit-based quantum hardware requires mapping the qudit Hilbert space to that of multiqubit which may be exponentially larger. To exclude the infeasible subspace, one common approach relies on penalizing the objective function. However, this strategy can be inefficient as the size of the illegitimate subspace grows. Here we propose to employ the Hamiltonian-based quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) through devising appropriate mixing Hamiltonians such that the infeasible configuration space is ruled out. We investigate this idea by employing binary, symmetric, and unary mapping techniques. It is shown that the standard mixing Hamiltonian (sum of the bit-flip operations) is the optimal option for symmetric mapping, where the controlled-NOT gate count is used as a measure of implementation cost. In contrast, the other two encoding schemes witness a $p$-fold increase in this figure for a $p$-layer QAOA. We apply this framework to quantum approximate thermalization and find the ground state of the repulsive Bose-Hubbard model in the strong and weak interaction regimes.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control of operation order constructed from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A$, $B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success probability and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$, defining the fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and the witness gaps $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{switch}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and $\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{test}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$.
  The non-Abelian mixers can either enhance or suppress the bare switch advantage, which we quantify by the interference contrast $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega):=\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)-\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\rm test}(\omega)-p_{\rm switch}(\omega)$. Across the Squier positivity region, $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega)$ takes both positive (constructive) and negative (destructive) values, a hallmark of matrix-valued (non-Abelian) order control, while $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)&gt;0$ certifies algebraic causal non-separability.
  Numerical simulations confirm both enhancement and suppression regimes, establishing a minimal $B_3$ braid control that reproduces the characteristic interference pattern expected from a \emph{Gedankenexperiment} in anyonic statistics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Non-Markovianity in Logical Qubit Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logical qubits encoded in quantum error correcting codes can exhibit non-Markovian dynamical evolution, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. To understand this emergent non-Markovianity, we define a Markovianity condition appropriate to logical gate operations, and study it by relating logical operations to their physical implementation (operations on the data qubits into which the logical qubit is encoded). We apply our analysis to small quantum codes, and show that they exhibit non-Markovian dynamics even for very simple physical noise models. We show that non-Markovianity can emerge from Markovian physical operations if (and only if) the physical qubits are not necessarily returned to the code subspace after every round of QEC. In this situation, the syndrome qubits can act as a memory, mediating time correlations and enabling violation of the Markov condition. We quantify the emergent non-Markovianity in simple examples, and propose sufficient conditions for reliable use of gate-based characterization techniques like gate set tomography in early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Real-space topological characterization of quasiperiodic quantum walks: Boundary-dependent phases and the Schur index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks with Fibonacci quasiperiodic modulation. Spectral analysis under open boundary conditions reveals isolated edge modes that coexist at both zero and $\pi$ energies within bulk gaps. Using the mean chiral displacement (MCD) as a dynamical bulk probe, we obtain a fractal, butterfly-like phase diagram, indicating a nontrivial bulk topology. However, since the MCD involves wave-packet averaging, its direct correspondence with boundary-localized states remains ambiguous. To resolve this issue, we determine the integer topological invariant by employing the Schur function formalism, a scattering-based approach defined on the unit disk. This analysis identifies a topological phase with winding number $W=2$ inside the ``wings'' of the butterfly diagram, demonstrating that the coexistence of zero- and $\pi$-energy edge modes is an intrinsic bulk property. Moreover, we find that the topological index crucially depends on the phason degree of freedom: the winding number can take values of $W=0$, $2$, and even $4$ depending on the local surface termination. This behavior originates from the surface impedance, which yields an effective winding number ranges from complete masking by reflective boundaries ($W=0$) to enhancement through surface resonances ($W=4$). Finally, we show that although individual surface terminations lead to anisotropic phase diagrams, their ensemble average restores the overall geometric structure observed in the MCD phase diagram. Our results establish a complete bulk-edge correspondence in quasiperiodic quantum walks and provide a guiding principle for surface topological engineering, where edge transport can be controlled purely through boundary manipulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Brownian motion with non-Gaussian noises: Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation and nonlinear Langevin equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $\omega_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=\lambda C_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-\lambda\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}\omega_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $\lambda$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $\lambda$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $\Delta(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $\Delta$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum optimization has gained increasing attention as advances in quantum hardware enable the exploration of problem instances approaching real-world scale. Among existing approaches, variational quantum algorithms and quantum annealing dominate current research; however, both typically rely on one-hot encodings that severely limit scalability. Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) was recently introduced as an alternative paradigm that reduces qubit requirements by embedding problem variables into Pauli correlations. Despite its promise, PCE has not yet been studied in the context of constrained optimization. In this work, we extend the PCE framework to constrained combinatorial optimization problems and evaluate its performance across multiple problem sizes. Our results show that the standard PCE formulation struggles to reliably enforce constraints, which motivates the introduction of the Iterative-$\alpha$ PCE. This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dark Matter Searches Using Integrated Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) with masses of order an electronvolt or below can have a non-zero coupling to electromagnetism while being compatible with cosmological observations. In these models, the ambient DM behaves as a new classical source in Maxwell's equations, which can excite potentially detectable electromagnetic (EM) fields in the laboratory. We propose a new integrated photonics-based approach to search for DM candidates in the 0.1 - few eV mass range. This approach offers a wide range of wavelength-scale devices like resonators and waveguides that are readily fabricated in large quantities, enabling a scalable and novel search. In particular, we demonstrate that refractive index-modulated resonators, such as etched/grooved microrings, or patterned slabs, support EM modes with efficient coupling to DM. When excited by DM, these modes are read out by coupling the resonators to a waveguide that terminates on a micron-scale-sized single photon detector, such as a single pixel of a low-noise charge-coupled device or a superconducting nanowire. We then estimate the sensitivity of this experimental concept in the context of axion-like particle and dark photon models of DM, demonstrating that nanophotonic confinement and scalability can extend dark matter sensitivity into previously unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of a controlled conical geometry on the electric charge transport through a two-dimensional quantum ring weakly coupled to both the emitter and the collector. These mesoscopic systems are known for being able to confine highly mobile electrons in a defined region of matter. In particular, we consider a GaAs device having an average radius of $800\hspace{0.05cm}\text{nm}$ in different regimes of subband occupation at non-zero temperature and under the influence of a weak and uniform background magnetic field. Using the adapted Landauer formula for the resonant tunneling and the energy eigenvalues, we explore how the modified surface affects the Van-Hove conductance singularities, the magnetoresistance interference patterns resulting from the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of different frequencies and the charge transport when an electric potential is applied in the terminals of the device. Magnetoresistance and charge current oscillations depending only on the curvature intensity are reported, providing a new feature that represents an alternative way to optimize the transport through the device by tuning its geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latching techniques are widely used to enhance readout of qubits. These methods require precise tuning of multiple tunnel rates, which can be challenging to achieve under realistic experimental conditions, such as when a qubit is coupled to a single reservoir. Here, we present a method for single-shot measurement of a quantum dot qubit with a single reservoir using a latched-readout scheme. Our approach involves pulsing a barrier gate to dynamically control qubit-to-reservoir tunnel rates, a method that is readily applicable to the latched readout of various spin-based qubits. We use this method to enable qubit state latching and to reduce the qubit reset time in measurements of coherent Larmor oscillations of a Si/SiGe quantum dot hybrid qubit.</description>

      <title>Decoherence from quantum spacetime noise: An open-systems framework with application to neutrino oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general open-quantum-systems framework to model decoherence induced by stochastic Planck-scale fluctuations of spacetime, focusing on the kappa-Minkowski noncommutative geometry as a representative quantum-gravity scenario. Treating the deformation parameter as Gaussian white noise, we derive a Lindblad-type master equation applicable to arbitrary quantum systems and obtain a distinctive inverse-energy scaling of the decoherence rate, Gamma proportional to E^{-4}. As an illustrative example, we analyze a three-level system motivated by neutrino flavor oscillations and derive closed-form expressions for survival and transition probabilities with spacetime-induced damping. The E^{-4} scaling contrasts sharply with the positive power laws often invoked in quantum-gravity phenomenology and predicts negligible decoherence for high-energy neutrinos consistent with IceCube observations, while implying that the strongest effects arise in the extreme low-energy regime. In this context, the sub-eV-scale energies characteristic of the cosmic neutrino background provide a natural infrared benchmark for illustrating the enhanced sensitivity to quantum-spacetime fluctuations. Our results establish a unified formalism connecting quantum-information methods, open-system dynamics, and quantum-spacetime phenomenology, thereby offering a framework for exploring potential signatures of Planck-scale physics in future low-energy neutrino studies.</description>

      <title>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group to link different scales. We uncover a novel transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</description>

      <title>Determining Molecular Ground State with Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution using Broken-Symmetry Wave Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function, commonly used for approximating molecular ground states, becomes nonideal in open shell systems due to the inherent multi-configurational nature of the wave function, limiting accuracy in Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE). We propose replacing the HF wave function with a spin- and spatial-symmetry broken wave function, enhancing convergence by adding a spin operator, $S^2$ as a penalty term to the original molecular Hamiltonian. We verify that this approach provides good convergence behavior towards the lowest energy eigenstate using direct matrix exponentiation for Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Numerical simulations were performed on the hydrogen molecule and a square tetrahydrogen cluster using measurement-assisted unitary approximation in QITE. QITE demonstrates faster convergence to the ground state with broken symmetry (BS) compared to HF, particularly after the molecule exhibits a diradical character of 0.56 for hydrogen. Prior to this point, HF remains more effective, suggesting a transition threshold of diradical character for wave function selection. Additionally, the overlap analysis with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CAS-CI) wave function shows that BS has a larger initial overlap than HF in higher-spin, multi-configurational systems like triple bond dissociation in nitrogen molecule. This method provides a pathway for improved energy simulations in open shell systems, where wave function accuracy significantly impacts downstream quantum algorithms and practical applications in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Wigner's friend's black hole adventure: an argument for complementarity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the heart of both black hole physics and Wigner's friend scenarios lies the question of unitarity. In Wigner's friend setups, sealed-lab measurements are modeled unitarily, probing the measurement problem. In black hole physics, the unitarity problem concerns information preservation in evaporation. We extend a recent analogy between these two puzzles exposed by Hausmann and Renner [arXiv:2504.03835v1] by constructing new paradoxes that merge black hole physics with extensions of the Wigner's friend scenario into a unified argument. This unified construction allows us to sharpen the cloning and firewall paradoxes, which leave room for a post-quantum theory to consistently describe the physics of black holes. We close this loophole, showing that no such theory exists if no observer can experimentally falsify quantum theory's predictions. We conclude by briefly highlighting subtleties in assumptions commonly used in black hole puzzles.</description>

      <title>Quantum estimation of cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Resisting Quantum Key Distribution Attacks Using Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing poses significant risks to the security of modern communication networks as it breaks today's public-key cryptographic algorithms. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a promising solution by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to establish secure keys. However, practical QKD implementations remain vulnerable to hardware imperfections and advanced attacks such as Photon Number Splitting and Trojan-Horse attacks. In this work, we investigate the potential of quantum machine learning (QML) to detect QKD attacks. In particular, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) model to improve detection performance. By combining quantum-enhanced learning with classical deep learning, the model captures temporal patterns in QKD data, improving detection accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model, we introduce a QKD dataset that simulates typical operations along with multiple attack scenarios, including Intercept-and-Resend, Photon-Number Splitting, Trojan-Horse, Detector Blinding, and Combined attacks. The dataset includes Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), signal and decoy loss rates, and time-based metrics. Our results demonstrate the promising performance of the quantum machine learning approach compared to classical models. The proposed Hybrid QLSTM achieved an accuracy of 94.7% after 50 training epochs. The evaluation is conducted on a semi-realistic, simulation-generated decoy-state BB84 dataset, and the reported performance should be interpreted as a proof-of-concept rather than a final assessment on field-deployed QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous SSH models and the doubling of orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</description>

      <title>A fast, large-scale optimal transport algorithm for holographic beam shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport methods have recently established state of the art accuracy and efficiency for holographic laser beam shaping. However, use of such methods is hindered by severe $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time requirements for large scale input or output images with $N$ total pixels. Here we leverage the dual formulation of the optimal transport problem and the separable structure of the cost to implement algorithms with greatly reduced $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ time complexity. These algorithms are parallelizable and can solve megapixel-scale beam shaping problems in tens of seconds on a CPU or seconds on a GPU.</description>

      <title>Wave-like amplification of near-threshold two-particle reactions: from muon-catalyzed fusion to $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ production at $e^-e^+$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple model is proposed to explain the recently found wave-like enhancement of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pair production near the threshold at the $e^-e^+$ annihilation, which allows extracting parameters of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ interaction and the $\Lambda$-hyperon rms-radius from the oscillatory nature of the measured cross section. In particular, it predicts a single bound state of $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ with a binding energy of $\varepsilon_{\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}}=(36\pm5)$MeV. The model is a generalization of the formulas obtained in our earlier work [1] to explain the effect of wave-like amplification found in it near the threshold of fusion reactions screened by a muon or electron. The analysis allows us to conclude that the effect of wave-like amplification is an integral feature of any two-particle near-threshold reaction. In this regard, it seems promising to investigate, within the framework of our model, the oscillatory nature of the electromagnetic form factors of hyperons and nucleons extracted in experiments on $e^- e^+$ annihilation. A natural further development of the model could be its generalization to processes of producing various hadron pairs in $e^-e^+$ annihilation.</description>
