      <title>Mind the peak: improving cosmological constraints from GWTC-4.0 spectral sirens using semiparametric mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave spectral sirens can provide cosmological constraints by using the shape of the binary black hole (BBH) mass distribution (MD). However, the precision and accuracy of these constraints depends critically on the capturing all the MD features. In this work, we analyze 137 BBH events from the latest GWTC-4.0 with a novel data-driven semiparametric approach based on \textsc{Bspline} that adaptively places knots around the most informative structures in the MD, while keeping the dimensionality of the parameter space moderate. Our flexible models resolve three distinct peaks at $\sim10$, $18$, and $33\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and are statistically preferred over standard parametric models, with Bayes factors up to 226. Because these features are correlated with $H_0$, the semiparametric model yields, under different prior assumptions, 12%-21% improvement in the precision of $H_0$ relative to parametric models, providing $H_0 = 57.8^{+21.9}_{-20.6}\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in the best case. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full complexity of the BBH mass distribution is essential for realizing the cosmological potential of spectral sirens as gravitational wave catalogs continue to grow.</description>

      <title>Filtering interlopers with photometry and diagnostic features: A machine learning framework validated with CSST slitless spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slitless spectroscopic method employed by missions such as Euclid and the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) faces a fundamental challenge: spectroscopic redshifts derived from their data are susceptible to emission line misidentification due to the limited spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. This effect systematically introduces interloper galaxies into the sample. Conventional strict selection not only struggles to secure high redshift purity but also drastically reduces completeness by discarding valuable data. To overcome this limitation, we develop an XGBoost classifier that leverages photometric properties and spectroscopic diagnostics to construct a high-purity redshift catalog while maximizing completeness. We validate this method on a simulated sample with spectra generated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. Of the $\sim$62 million galaxies that obtain valid redshifts (parent sample), approximately 43% achieve accurate measurements, defined as $|\Delta z| \leq 0.002(1+z)$. From this parent sample, the XGBoost classifier selects galaxies with a selection efficiency of 42.3% on the test set and 42.2% when deployed on the entire parent sample. Crucially, among the retained galaxies, 96.6% (parent sample: 96.5%) achieve accurate measurements, while the outlier fraction ($|\Delta z|&gt;0.01(1+z)$) is constrained to 0.13% (0.11%). We verified that simplified configurations which exclude either spectroscopic diagnostics (except the measured redshift) or photometric data yield significantly higher outlier fractions, increasing by factors of approximately 3.5 and 6.3 respectively, with the latter case also introducing notable catastrophic interloper contamination. This framework effectively resolves the purity-completeness trade-off, enabling robust large-scale cosmological studies with CSST and similar surveys.</description>

      <title>Towards an optimal extraction of cosmological parameters from galaxy cluster surveys using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility to constrain cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys using field-level machine learning methods that bypass traditional summary statistics analyses, depends crucially on our ability to generate simulated training sets. The latter need to be both realistic, as to reproduce the key features of the real data, and produced in large numbers, as to allow us to refine the precision of the training process. The analysis presented in this paper is an attempt to respond to these needs by (a) using clusters of galaxies as tracers of large-scale structure, together with (b) adopting a 3LPT code (Pinocchio) to generate a large training set of $32\,768$ mock X-ray cluster catalogues. X-ray luminosities are stochastically assigned to dark matter haloes using an empirical $M-L_X$ scaling relation. Using this training set, we test the ability and performances of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the cosmological parameters, based on an input overdensity field derived from the cluster distribution. We perform a comparison with a neural network trained on traditional summary statistics, that is, the abundance of clusters and their power spectrum. Our results show that the field-level analysis combined with the cluster abundance yields a mean absolute relative error on the predicted values of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ that is a factor of $\sim 10 \%$ and $\sim 20\%$ better than that obtained from the summary statistics. Furthermore, when information about the individual luminosity of each cluster is passed to the CNN, the gain in precision exceeds $50\%$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on viable $f(R)$ models using weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Universe remains one of the central open problems in modern cosmology. While the $\Lambda$CDM model successfully describes a wide range of observations, the physical nature of dark energy is still unknown, motivating the study of alternative theories of gravity. Among these, $f(R)$ models provide a well-established extension of General Relativity, capable of reproducing a $\Lambda$CDM-like background evolution without introducing an explicit dark energy component. However, they can induce deviations in the growth of cosmic structures, making them testable through observables sensitive to cosmological perturbations. In this work, we use weak gravitational lensing to constrain several viable $f(R)$ gravity models. We analyze their impact on the matter power spectrum, as well as on the convergence and cosmic shear power spectra. Our analysis is carried out within a Bayesian framework using the \textit{Cobaya} code and its modified gravity extension, \textit{MGCobaya}, which enables consistent theoretical predictions and their comparison with current weak lensing and CMB lensing data. We find that standard cosmological parameters remain consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario for all models considered, as expected from their background degeneracy. Nevertheless, we obtain non-trivial and model-dependent constraints on the characteristic parameters of several $f(R)$ theories.</description>

      <title>Fast rotations in galaxies at cosmic noon indicate central concentration of stars, dark matter or massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotation curves of regularly rotating disc galaxies are a unique probe of the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution. Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at $z&gt;0.5$ was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations.</description>

      <title>Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter as a Probe of Inflationary Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos offer a minimal and testable explanation for dark matter (DM), with their radiative decay actively searched for in X-ray observations. We show that cold sterile neutrino DM can be efficiently produced during reheating from inflaton decays with a tiny branching ratio, ${\rm BR}\lesssim 10^{-4}$. This production mechanism opens regions of parameter space where the active-sterile mixing is small enough to evade current X-ray constraints while reproducing the observed DM abundance. We systematically map the viable parameter space in terms of the sterile neutrino mass, mixing angle, inflaton mass, reheating temperature, and branching ratio. We further demonstrate that sterile neutrino DM can serve as a probe of inflationary reheating, with future X-ray observations capable of setting lower bounds on the reheating temperature several orders of magnitude above the existing bound from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Probabilistic Galaxy Detection and Deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stage-IV dark energy wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will observe an unprecedented number density of galaxies. As a result, the majority of imaged galaxies will visually overlap, a phenomenon known as blending. Blending is expected to be a leading source of systematic error in astronomical measurements. To mitigate this systematic, we propose a new probabilistic method for detecting, deblending, and measuring the properties of galaxies, called the Bayesian Light Source Separator (BLISS). Given an astronomical survey image, BLISS uses convolutional neural networks to produce a probabilistic astronomical catalog by approximating the posterior distribution over the number of light sources, their centroids' locations, and their types (galaxy vs. star). BLISS additionally includes a denoising autoencoder to reconstruct unblended galaxy profiles. As a first step towards demonstrating the feasibility of BLISS for cosmological applications, we apply our method to simulated single-band images whose properties are representative of year-10 LSST coadds. First, we study each BLISS component independently and examine its probabilistic output as a function of SNR and degree of blending. Then, by propagating the probabilistic detections from BLISS to its deblender, we produce per-object flux posteriors. Using these posteriors yields a substantial improvement in aperture flux residuals relative to deterministic detections alone, particularly for highly blended and faint objects. These results highlight the potential of BLISS as a scalable, uncertainty-aware tool for mitigating blending-induced systematics in next-generation cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Real-time Gravitational Wave Response in Thermal Spinning fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the spin content of the thermal plasmas affects the propagation of gravitational waves in a radiation-dominated universe. As a simple but representative setup, we consider conformal scalar, Weyl fermion, and Maxwell fields that provide the background radiation, and we ask whether the resulting damping and phase shift of gravitational waves retain any memory of their spins. We revisit this question in a real-time quantum-field-theoretic framework, where the stress tensor splits into a background part, a dynamical (history-dependent) response, and local contact terms, with an additional on-shell projection fixed by the Friedmann equation. We find that the dynamical spin-dependent response arises on a short time scale characterized by the radiation temperature, which is exactly canceled by the local responses. As a result, the remaining long-time response is universal and consistent with kinetic theory in the hard thermal limit. Although the underlying mechanism exhibits strong spin dependence, it leaves no observable imprint on the large-scale effective dynamics of gravitational waves in this setup.</description>

      <title>Polarization rotation through differential transmission in refractive CMB telescopes identified using a hybrid physical optics method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a polarization rotation systematic in the far field beams of refractive cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes caused by differential transmission in anti-reflection (AR) coatings of optical elements. This systematic was identified following the development of a hybrid physical optics method that incorporates full-wave electromagnetic simulations of AR coatings to model the full polarization response of refractive systems. Applying this method to a two-lens CMB telescope with non-ideal AR coating, we show that polarization-dependent transmission can produce a rotation of the far-field polarization angle that varies across the focal plane with a typical amplitude of 0.05-0.5 degrees. If ignored in analysis, this effect can produce temperature to polarization leakage and Stokes Q/U mixing.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of cosmological perturbations: The residual low multipole ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, long-wavelength modes are related to large-gauge transformations (LGT), i.e. changes of coordinates that modify the physical geometry of the cosmological patch. These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner.</description>

      <title>Machian Gravity: Modeling Rotation Curves and Radial Acceleration in the SPARC Galaxy Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of Machian Gravity (MG), a five-dimensional theory of gravity, to explain the acceleration law governing rotationally bound systems, in particular spiral galaxies. MG was proposed as a framework capable of accounting for a range of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena -- including galactic rotation curves, mass distributions in galaxy clusters, and cosmic expansion -- without invoking additional dark components. In this study, we apply the MG acceleration law to a large sample of galaxies drawn from the SPARC database. Through a detailed analysis, we determine the optimal MG parameters for each individual galaxy, successfully fitting their observed rotation curves. Similar to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), our results indicate the existence of a characteristic acceleration scale associated with galactic dynamics, which regulates rotational behavior in the outer regions. Notably, this acceleration scale varies from galaxy to galaxy, but typically remains of order $10^{-8} {\rm cm/s^2}$.</description>

      <title>PySCo: A fast Particle-Mesh $N$-body code for modified gravity simulations in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PySCo, a fast and user-friendly Python library designed to run cosmological $N$-body simulations across various cosmological models, such as $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, and alternative theories of gravity, including $f(R)$, MOND and time-dependent gravitational constant parameterisations. PySCo employs Particle-Mesh solvers, using multigrid or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods in their different variations. Additionally, PySCo can be easily integrated as an external library, providing utilities for particle and mesh computations. The library offers key features, including an initial condition generator based on up to third-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT), power spectrum estimation, and computes the background and growth of density perturbations. In this paper, we detail PySCo's architecture and algorithms and conduct extensive comparisons with other codes and numerical methods. Our analysis shows that, with sufficient small-scale resolution, the power spectrum at redshift $z = 0$ remains independent of the initial redshift at the 0.1\% level for $z_{\rm ini} \geq$ 125, 30, and 10 when using first, second, and third-order LPT, respectively. Although the seven-point Laplacian method used in multigrid also leads to power suppression on small scales, this effect can largely be mitigated when computing ratios. In terms of performance, PySCo only requires approximately one CPU hour to complete a Newtonian simulation with $512^3$ particles (and an equal number of cells) on a laptop. Due to its speed and ease of use, PySCo is ideal for rapidly generating vast ensemble of simulations and exploring parameter spaces, allowing variations in gravity theories, dark energy models, and numerical approaches. This versatility makes PySCo a valuable tool for producing emulators, covariance matrices, or training datasets for machine learning.</description>

      <title>DESI Dark Secrets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first year results of DESI (DR1) provide evidence that dark energy may not be quantum vacuum energy ($\Lambda$). If true, this would be an extraordinary development in the 25-year quest to understand cosmic acceleration. The best-fit DESI $w_0w_a$ models for dark energy, which underpin the claim, have strange behavior. They achieve a maximum energy density around $z\simeq 0.5 $ and rapidly decrease before and after. We explore physics-based models where the dark energy is a rolling scalar-field. Our four scalar-field models are characterized by one dimensionless parameter $\beta$, which in the limit of $\beta \rightarrow 0$ reduces to $\Lambda$CDM. While none of our models fit the DESI data significantly better than $\Lambda$CDM, for values of $\beta$ of order unity, they fit about as well as $\Lambda$CDM. We also consider the second data release from DESI (DR2), CMB data and supernovae data. The DR2 results are consistent with the DR1, and the combination of DESI, CMB and SNe favor $\beta = 0.23 - 0.95$, providing some evidence for a scalar-field explanation for dark energy. While the DESI data prefer $w_0w_a$ to a scalar field, the SNe data prefer a scalar field to $w_0w_a$, and together they favor a $w_0w_a$ model. We study the limits of $w_0w_a$ in describing dark energy, especially scalar field models, and also point out that the strange behavior of the best-fit DESI models could arise due to the matter density not varying as expected or an unaccounted for component of energy density in the Universe.</description>

      <title>The dynamical and thermodynamic effects of turbulence on the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both simulations and observations indicate that the so-called missing baryons reside in the intergalactic medium known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this study we employed the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation to demonstrate that knowledge of the turbulence in the cosmic baryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial distribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the Universe. First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, and prevent the convergence of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a steady state within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as the redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and converted into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas. We find that, compared with turbulence in the cosmic fluid, shocks are unimportant in intermediate-density regions and even negligible in high-density regions, both dynamically and thermodynamically. This finding accounts for the origin of the WHIM in terms of both dynamics and thermodynamics, calls into question the traditional view of shock-heating, and highlights the importance of turbulence in shaping the large-scale structure of the Universe, particularly in the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. In addition to TNG50-1, we validated our key findings with TNG50-2, TNG100-1, WIGEON, and EAGLE simulations, demonstrating that the spatial resolution, box size, and sub-grid-physics variations do not affect our main conclusions.</description>

      <title>AliCPT Sensitivity to Cosmic Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first assessment of the Ali Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Telescope's (AliCPT) sensitivity to the reheating epoch after cosmic inflation, based on its ability to detect primordial gravitational waves. We consider three models of inflation, an $\alpha$-attractor T-model, RGI inflation and QCD-driven warm inflation. Assuming a fiducial value of $r=0.01$, we find that AliCPT-1, in its fully loaded focal plane detector configuration and combined with Planck, can provide measurements of the order of magnitude of the reheating temperature with an accuracy around $10\%$. For QCD-driven warm inflation this can be translated into a constraint on the inflaton coupling to gluons, which can be probed independently in axion search experiments. Our results constitute the first demonstration of AliCPT's ability to probe the initial temperature of the hot big bang and the microphysical parameter connecting cosmic inflation and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Halo: Joint Model for Measurements of the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect and Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first joint analysis of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect with galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) for CMASS galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We show these complementary probes can disentangle baryons from dark matter in the outskirts of galactic halos by alleviating model degeneracies that are present when fitting to kSZ or GGL measurements alone. In our joint kSZ+GGL analysis we show that the baryon density profile is well constrained on scales from 0.3 to 50 Mpc/$h$. With our well constrained profile of the baryon density, we provide direct comparisons to simulations. For our model we find an outer slope of the baryon distribution that is shallower than predicted by some hydrodynamical simulations, consistent with enhanced baryonic feedback. We also show that not including baryons in a model for GGL can bias halo mass estimates low by $\sim 20\%$ compared to a model that includes baryons and is jointly fit to kSZ+GGL measurements. Our modelling code galaxy-galaxy lensing and kSZ (\texttt{glasz}) is publicly available at https://github.com/James11222/glasz.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of background evolution and structure formation in phase space: a semi-cosmographic reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature, imprinted in the transverse and radial clustering of dark matter tracers, enables the simultaneous measurement of the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at a given redshift. Further, measuring the redshift space anisotropy (RSD) allows us to measure the combination $f_8(z)\equiv f\sigma_8(z)$. Motivated by this, we simultaneously study the dynamics of background evolution and structure formation in an abstract phase space of dynamical quantities: $ x = H_0 D_A/c$, $p = dx/dz$, and $f_8$. We adopt a semi-cosmographic approach, whereby we do not pre-assume any specific dark energy model to integrate the dynamical system. The Luminosity distance is expanded as a Pad\'e rational approximation in the variable $(1+z)^{1/2}$. The dynamical system is solved by using a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which incorporates the dark matter density parameter along with the parameters of the Pad\'e expansion. The semi-cosmographic $D_A(z), H(z)$ and $f\sigma_8(z)$, thus obtained, are fitted with BAO and RSD data from the SDSS IV. The reconstructed phase trajectories in the $3D$ $(x,p,f_8)$ space are used to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and structure formation. At low redshifts, a discernible departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model is observed. The geometry of the phase trajectories in the projected spaces allows us to identify three key redshifts where future observations may be directed for a better understanding of cosmic tensions and anomalies.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced gravitational waves from coherent initial states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.</description>

      <title>XRISM-Subaru views of Abell 754: an off-axis, near-line-of-sight merging cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a weak-lensing (WL) mass measurement for the merging cluster Abell 754 and impose constraints on the merger trajectory. The trajectory analysis adopts a two-body model with a point-mass approximation and dynamical friction, refined using numerical simulations of major mergers and characterized by Euler angles. We first conduct WL analysis using the two-dimensional shear pattern from the Subaru HSC in combination with Suprime-Cam images to assist in color selection. The WL mass map shows a distinct double-peak structure located around the western and eastern brightest cluster galaxies as reported in the literature. The two-halo component analysis, which utilizes the 2D shear pattern over the cluster entire region and considers the lensing covariance matrix from uncorrelated large-scale structures, indicates mass values of $M_{200}^W=3.13_{-1.00}^{+1.53}\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ and $M_{200}^E=6.41_{-1.97}^{+2.92}\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$. Thus, the eastern mass component associated with the X-ray tadpole-shaped gas is the main cluster. No substantial structural components are detected in the line-of-sight velocities of the member galaxies. Utilizing WL parameters, line-of-sight velocities, and X-ray information on morphology and kinematics, we determine an impact parameter of approximately 0.77 Mpc at an initial separation of 2 Mpc from the main cluster. The merger plane is inclined at about 20 degrees relative to the line-of-sight. Interestingly, this system is an off-axis, near-line-of-sight merger. This characteristic arises because the trajectory within the merger plane is altered during the pericenter passage, causing the apparent motion to transition from predominantly along the line-of-sight before the core passage to mainly within the plane of the sky afterward. This study will assist in conducting numerical simulations to understand the XRISM observations.</description>

      <title>The impact of non-Gaussianity when searching for Primordial Black Holes with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LISA can observe cosmological millihertz (mHz) gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds that may offer a decisive test for asteroid-mass primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM). In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of SN 2022jli: The first double-peaked stripped-envelope supernova showing periodic undulations and dust emission at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical and infrared observations from maximum light until around +800 days of supernova (SN) 2022jli, a peculiar stripped-envelope (SE) SN showing two maxima, each one with a peak luminosity of about $3 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, separated by 50 days. The second maximum is followed by unprecedented periodic undulations with a period of $P \sim 12.5$ days. The spectra and the photometric evolution of the first maximum are consistent with the behaviour of a standard SE SN with an ejecta mass of $\sim 1.5$ $M_{\odot}$ and a radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim 0.12$ $M_{\odot}$. The optical spectra after +400 days relative to the first maximum correspond to a standard SN Ic event, and at late times SN 2022jli exhibits a significant drop in the optical luminosity, implying that the physical phenomena that produced the secondary maximum have ceased to power the SN light curve. Among other potential scenarios, we discuss how the second maximum could be powered by a magnetar, while the light curve periodic undulations could be produced by accretion of material from a companion star onto the neutron star in a binary system. The near-infrared spectra shows clear first CO overtone emission from about +190 days after the first maximum, and it becomes undetected at +400 days. A significant near-infrared excess from hot dust emission is detected at +238 days, having been produced by either newly formed dust in the SN ejecta or a strong near-infrared dust echo. Depending on the assumptions of the dust composition, the estimated dust mass is $2-16 \times 10^{-4}$ $M_{\odot}$. The potential magnetar power of the second maximum can fit into a more general picture in which magnetars are the power source of SE super-luminous SNe, and could explain bumps, undulations, and late-time excess emission in SE SNe.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Scalar parity-odd trispectrum from gravitational Chern-Simons interaction vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore parity violation in a scalar trispectrum from a dynamical Chern-Simons gravity theory. So far, a graviton-mediated diagram with two vertexes being of general relativity has been studied in this theory by taking into account the impact of a modified dispersion relation of gravitons on graviton's bulk propagators. We instead study a parity-odd trispectrum from both a graviton-mediated diagram, where one of the two vertexes originates from the Chern-Simons term, and a contact diagram by using the bulk propagators in general relativity. After computing the scalar-scalar-tensor cubic interactions and the scalar quartic ones originating from the Chern-Simons term, first we show that the resultant parity-odd trispectrum vanishes in the case of Bunch-Davies initial conditions, which is consistent with a no-go theorem for a non-vanishing parity-odd trispectrum. Then, we discuss a way to acquire a non-vanishing parity-odd trispectrum from the viewpoint of non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Scalar Dark Matter Co-Scattering in EFT with Monophoton Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the co-scattering mechanism for dark matter production in an EFT framework which contains new $Z_2$-odd singlets, namely two fermions $N_{1,2}$ and a real scalar $\chi$. The singlet scalar $\chi$ is the dark matter candidate. The dimension-5 operators play a vital role to set the observed DM relic density. We focus on a nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the $Z_2$ odd particles to allow for a significant contribution from the co-scattering or co-annihilation mechanisms. We present two benchmark points where either of the two mechanisms primarily set the DM relic abundance. The main constraint on the model at the LHC arise from the ATLAS mono-$\gamma$ search. We obtain the parameter space allowed by the observed relic density and the mono-$\gamma$ search after performing a scan over the key parameters, the masses $M_{N_{1,2}}, M_\chi$ and couplings $c_3^\prime, y^\prime_{11,22}$. We find the region of parameter space where the relic abundance is set primarily by the co-scattering mechanism while being allowed by the LHC search. We also determine how the model can be further probed at the HL-LHC via the mono-$\gamma$ signature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel realization of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings arising from the spontaneous breaking of an extended gauge symmetry $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in the context of a low-scale split seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2&lt;1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the type-I seesaw model to realise leptogenesis from the co-annihilation of dark sector particles. The type-I seesaw model is extended with a singlet fermion and two singlet scalars charged under a $Z_{2}$ symmetry. The $Z_{2}$-odd singlet scalar is the dark matter candidate. Here the usual type-I seesaw mechanism generates neutrino mass, and a net lepton asymmetry is generated from the co-annihilation of the dark matter and the $Z_2$-odd singlet fermion. The $Z_{2}$-even singlet scalar is important in dark matter phenomenology. Successful leptogenesis is possible at TeV-scale, unlike the vanilla case. This minimal extension provides an elegant explanation of successful leptogenesis with direct connection to the dark matter abundance in the Universe.</description>

Abstract: The cosmological principle, asserting large-scale homogeneity and isotropy, underpins the standard model of cosmology. Testing its validity using independent astronomical probes remains crucial for understanding the global structure of the Universe. We investigate the angular distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) using two of the most comprehensive all-sky datasets available, the BATSE (CGRO) and Fermi GBM catalogs, to test the isotropy of the GRB sky at large angular scales. We perform spherical harmonic decomposition of the GRB sky maps and estimate the dipole and quadrupole amplitudes. Statistical significance is evaluated by comparing the observed multipole amplitudes against distributions derived from 500 Monte Carlo realizations of isotropic skies. Our results show that the observed dipole amplitudes for both BATSE and Fermi GBM datasets lie within the $1\sigma$ region of their respective null distributions. However, the quadrupole amplitude in the raw, uncorrected BATSE and Fermi GBM skies appears elevated at $3.7\sigma$ and $3.0\sigma$, respectively. After incorporating the BATSE sky exposure function, this apparent quadrupole anisotropy vanishes, indicating that instrumental non-uniformities fully account for the signal in that case. Owing to the absence of a publicly available full-sky exposure model for Fermi GBM, the Fermi analysis is restricted to the raw sky distribution. Our method's reliability is validated through controlled simulations, which show it can detect the injected dipoles in BATSE-sized isotropic skies. These findings reinforce the statistical isotropy of the GRB sky and underscore the importance of accurate exposure corrections in cosmological anisotropy analyses.</description>

      <title>Exotic compact objects in Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories</title>

Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)&lt;{\cal C}&lt;{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)&gt;0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</description>
