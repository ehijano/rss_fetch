      <description>arXiv:2505.11172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any algebraic curve $C$ given by $f(x,y)=0$, where $f(x,y)$ is a weakly tame polynomial in $ \mathbb{K}[x,y]$, the $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$-module of polynomial 1-forms admitting $C$ as an invariant curve is generated by two polynomail 1-forms, one of which is $\mathrm{d}f$, if and only if, $f$ belongs to the Jacobian ideal $\langle f_x, f_y\rangle$ in $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$, where $\mathbb{K}\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ is any characteristic $0$ subfield of $\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>Increasing delay as a strategy to prove stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider difference equations of the form $x_{n+1}=F_0(x_n,\ldots,x_{n-k+1}),$ and increase the delay through a process of successive substitutions to obtain a sequence of systems $y_{n+1}=F_j(x_{n-j},\ldots,x_{n-k-j+1}),\; j=0,1,\ldots$. We call this process \emph{the expansion strategy} and use it to establish novel results that enable us to prove stability. When the map $F_0$ is sufficiently smooth and has a hyperbolic fixed point, we show the fixed point is locally asymptotically stable if and only if $\|\nabla F_j\|_1&lt;1$ for some finite number $j$. Our local stability results complement recent results obtained on Schur stability, and they can provide an alternative to the highly acclaimed Jury's algorithm. Also, we show the effectiveness of the expansion strategy in obtaining global stability results. Global stability results are obtained by integrating the expansion strategy with the embedding technique. Finally, we give illustrative examples to show the results' practical applicability across various discrete-time dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of (a)Synchronism on ECA: Towards a New Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effect of (a)synchronism on the dynamics of elementary cellular automata. Within the framework of our study, we choose five distinct update schemes, selected from the family of periodic update modes: parallel, sequential, block-sequential, block-parallel, and local clocks. Our main measure of complexity is the maximum period of the limit cycles in the dynamics of each rule. In this context, we present a classification of the ECA rule landscape. We classified most elementary rules into three distinct regimes: constant, linear, and superpolynomial. Surprisingly, while some rules exhibit more complex behavior under a broader class of update schemes, others show similar behavior across all the considered update schemes. Although we are able to derive upper and lower bounds for the maximum period of the limit cycles in most cases, the analysis of some rules remains open. To complement the study of the 88 elementary rules, we introduce a numerical simulation framework based on two main measurements: the energy and density of the configurations. In this context, we observe that some rules exhibit significant variability depending on the update scheme, while others remain stable, confirming what was observed as a result of the classification obtained in the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Unique global solution of an integral-differential equation of Footloose Entrepreneur model in new economic geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the Footloose Entrepreneur model in new economic geography in continuous space. In an appropriate function space, the model is formulated as an initial value problem for an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation. A unique global solution is constructed based on the Banach fixed point theorem. The stability of a homogeneous stationary solution is then investigated and numerical simulations of the asymptotic behavior of the solution are performed. Numerical solutions starting near the unstable homogeneous stationary solution converge to spike-shaped stationary solutions, and the number of spikes decreases with decreasing transport costs and strengthening preference for variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1706.02678v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the post-critical set of a class of holomorphic systems with an irrationally indifferent fixed point. We prove a trichotomy for the topology of the post-critical set based on the arithmetic of the rotation number at the fixed point. The only options are Jordan curves, a one-sided hairy Jordan curves, and Cantor bouquet. This explains the degeneration of the closed invariant curves inside the Siegel disks, as one varies the rotation number.</description>

      <title>A dispersive effective equation for transverse propagation of planar shallow water waves over periodic bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves propagating over bathymetry that varies periodically in one direction and is constant in the other. Plane waves traveling along the constant direction are known to evolve into solitary waves, due to an effective dispersion. We apply multiple-scale perturbation theory to derive an effective constant-coefficient system of equations, showing that the transversely-averaged wave approximately satisfies a Boussinesq-type equation, while the lateral variation in the wave is related to certain integral functions of the bathymetry. Thus the homogenized equations not only accurately describe these waves but also predict their full two-dimensional shape in some detail. Numerical experiments confirm the good agreement between the effective equations and the variable-bathymetry shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>A quantitative model for the Frank-Read dislocation source based on pinned mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a simple quantitative model for the Frank--Read source, considered to be one of the most important micro-mechanical mechanisms of dislocation creation in crystalline materials. It has long been known that these sources create dislocations in a repetitive, oscillatory process, which is driven by an external shear force. Unlike the existing explanations in the literature, the model introduced in the present article is based on just a few simple physical principles, namely line tension and dislocation motion due to a single slip plane flow rule, together with a pinning constraint on the ends of the central dislocation line. A complete discretisation, including suitable re-meshing and ``topological cutting'' algorithms, is described and simulation results are discussed. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the model and discretisation described in the present work yield remarkably accurate predictions about the shape and properties of the Frank--Read source. In particular, it is shown that only one dimensionless parameter controls the dynamics of the Frank--Read source if one neglects crystal anisotropy. This allows to derive an emergent law about the length of dislocation line generated per shear energy.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Survival Model for Stripe Formation in Zebrafish Exhibits Turing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zebrafish have been used as a model organism in many areas of biology, including the study of pattern formation. The mean-field survival model is a coupled ODE system describing the expected evolution of chromatophores coordinating to form stripes in zebrafish. This paper presents analysis of the model focusing on parameters for the number of cells, length of distant-neighbor interactions, and rates related to birth and death of chromatophores. We derive the conditions on these parameters for a Turing bifurcation to occur and show that the model predicts patterns qualitatively similar to those in nature.
  In addition to answering questions about this particular model, this paper also serves as a case study for Turing analysis on coupled ODE systems. The qualitative behavior of such coupled ODE models may deviate significantly from continuum limit models. The ability to analyze such systems directly avoids this concern and allows for a more accurate description of the behavior at physically relevant scales.</description>

      <title>What Leads to Administrative Bloat? A Dynamic Model of Administrative Cost and Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Administrative burden has been growing in organizations despite many counterproductive effects. We develop a system dynamics model to explain why this phenomenon occurs and to explore potential remedies. Prior literature has identified behavioral mechanisms leading to process creation, obsolescence, and removal, but typically examines them individually. Here, we integrate these mechanisms in the context of an organization allocating limited resources to competing priorities. We show that their interaction -- via accumulation and feedback loops -- leads to two possible outcomes: a sustainable equilibrium, where administrative costs stabilizes, and runaway administrative bloat, where administrative costs and waste accumulate in a self-reinforcing cycle. The two outcomes are separated by a critical threshold in management behavioral parameters -- the propensity to create processes in response to problems, and the propensity to prune obsolete processes in response to administrative burden. Rapid environmental change worsens the threshold, making bloat more likely. We evaluate several intervention strategies using simulation and find that lasting reductions in administrative costs and waste require two key commitments: a permanent shift in organizational priorities, and investment in discerning obsolete processes from useful ones. In contrast, temporary shifts and indiscriminate process cuts offer only short-lived relief. Counterintuitively, we find that prioritizing direct production can increase administrative waste. Our findings suggest that while dynamic environments make administrative bloat more likely, administrative bloat is not inevitable -- managers play a critical role in preventing or reversing it.</description>

      <title>Stability of travelling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion equations driven by additive noise with H\"older continuous paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with H\"older continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Brownian motion with general Hurst index. We obtain long- and short time asymptotic error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts. These bounds, in terms of Hurst index and H\"older exponent, apply to a large class of infinite-dimensional self-similar drivers with H\"older continuous paths, such as linear fractional stable motion. We find that for short times, higher Hurst indices imply higher stability, while for large times, a smaller gap between Hurst index and H\"older exponent implies stability for larger noise amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Binned Spectral Power Loss for Improved Prediction of Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting multiscale chaotic dynamical systems with deep learning remains a formidable challenge due to the spectral bias of neural networks, which hinders the accurate representation of fine-scale structures in long-term predictions. This issue is exacerbated when models are deployed autoregressively, leading to compounding errors and instability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate the spectral bias which we call the Binned Spectral Power (BSP) Loss. The BSP loss is a frequency-domain loss function that adaptively weighs errors in predicting both larger and smaller scales of the dataset. Unlike traditional losses that focus on pointwise misfits, our BSP loss explicitly penalizes deviations in the energy distribution across different scales, promoting stable and physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that the BSP loss mitigates the well-known problem of spectral bias in deep learning. We further validate our approach for the data-driven high-dimensional time-series forecasting of a range of benchmark chaotic systems which are typically intractable due to spectral bias. Our results demonstrate that the BSP loss significantly improves the stability and spectral accuracy of neural forecasting models without requiring architectural modifications. By directly targeting spectral consistency, our approach paves the way for more robust deep learning models for long-term forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems.</description>
