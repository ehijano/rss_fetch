      <title>When time delays and phase lags are not the same: higher-order phase reduction unravels delay-induced synchronization in oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled oscillators with time-delayed network interactions are critical to understand synchronization phenomena in many physical systems. Phase reductions to finite-dimensional phase oscillator networks allow for their explicit analysis. However, first-order phase reductions - where delays correspond to phase lags - fail to capture the delay-dependence of synchronization. We develop a systematic approach to derive phase reductions for delay-coupled oscillators to arbitrary order. Already the second-order reduction can predict delay-dependent (bi-)stability of synchronized states as demonstrated for Stuart-Landau oscillators.</description>

      <title>Heart Rate Variability Series is the Output of a non-Chaotic System driven by Dynamical Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) series reflects the dynamical variation of heartbeat-to-heartbeat intervals in time and is one of the outputs of the cardiovascular system. Over the years, this system has been recognized for generating nonlinear and complex heartbeat dynamics, with the latter referring to a high sensitivity to small -- theoretically infinitesimal -- input changes. While early research associated chaotic behavior with the cardiovascular system, evidence of stochastic inputs to the system, i.e., a physiological noise, invalidated those conclusions. To date, a comprehensive characterization of the cardiovascular system dynamics, accounting for dynamical noise input, has not been undertaken. In this study, we propose a novel methodological framework for evaluating the presence of regular or chaotic dynamics in noisy dynamical systems. The method relies on the estimation of asymptotic growth rate of noisy mean square displacement series in a two-dimensional phase space. We validated the proposed method using synthetic series comprising well-known regular and chaotic maps. We applied the method to real HRV series from healthy subjects, as well as patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, during unstructured long-term activity. Results indicate that HRV series are consistently generated by a regular system driven by dynamical noise.</description>

      <title>Reduction of dust radial drift by turbulence in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust particles in protoplanetary disks, lacking support from pressure, rotate at velocities exceeding those of the surrounding gas. Consequently, they experience a head-wind from the gas that drives them toward the central star. Radial drift occurs on timescales much shorter than those inferred from disk observations or those required for dust to aggregate and form planets. Additionally, turbulence is often assumed to amplify the radial drift of dust in planet-forming disks when modeled through an effective viscous transport. However, the local interactions between turbulent eddies and particles are known to be significantly more intricate than in a viscous fluid. Our objective is to elucidate and characterize the dynamic effects of Keplerian turbulence on the mean radial and azimuthal velocities of dust particles. We employ 2D shearing-box incompressible simulations of the gas, which is maintained in a developed turbulent state while rotating at a sub-Keplerian speed. Dust is modeled as Lagrangian particles set at a Keplerian velocity, therefore experiencing a radial force toward the star through drag. Turbulent eddies are found to reduce the radial drift, while simultaneously enhancing the azimuthal velocities of small particles. This dynamic behavior arises from the modification of dust trajectories due to turbulent eddies.</description>
