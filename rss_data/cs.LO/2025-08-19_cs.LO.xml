      <title>Categorical Construction of Logically Verifiable Neural Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks excel at pattern recognition but struggle with reliable logical reasoning, often violating basic logical principles during inference. We address this limitation by developing a categorical framework that systematically constructs neural architectures with provable logical guarantees. Our approach treats logical theories as algebraic structures called Lawvere theories, which we transform into neural networks using categorical algebra in the 2-category of parametric maps. Unlike existing methods that impose logical constraints during training, our categorical construction embeds logical principles directly into the network's architectural structure, making logical violations mathematically impossible. We demonstrate this framework by constructing differentiable neural architectures for propositional logic that preserve boolean reasoning while remaining trainable via gradient descent. Our main theoretical result establishes a bijective correspondence between finitary logical theories and neural architectures, proving that every logically constrained network arises uniquely from our construction. This extends Categorical Deep Learning beyond geometric symmetries to semantic constraints, enabling automatic derivation of verified architectures from logical specifications. The framework provides mathematical foundations for trustworthy AI systems, with applications to theorem proving, formal verification, and safety-critical reasoning tasks requiring verifiable logical behavior.</description>

      <title>Queen Domination by SAT Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The queen domination problem asks for the minimum number of queens needed to attack all squares on an $n\times n$ chessboard. Once this optimal number is known, determining the number of distinct solutions up to isomorphism has also attracted considerable attention. Previous work has introduced specialized and highly optimized search procedures to address open instances of the problem. While efficient in terms of runtime, these approaches have not provided proofs that can be independently verified by third-party checkers. In contrast, this paper aims to combine efficiency with verifiability. We reduce the problem to a propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) using a straightforward encoding, and solve the resulting formulas with modern SAT solvers capable of generating proof certificates. By improving the SAT encoding with a novel literal ordering strategy, and leveraging established techniques such as static symmetry breaking and the Cube-and-Conquer paradigm, this paper achieves both performance and trustworthiness. Our approach discovers and corrects a discrepancy in previous results for $n=16$ and resolves the previously open case $n=19$.</description>

      <title>Finite Axiomatizability by Disjunctive Existential Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rule-based languages lie at the core of several areas of central importance to databases and artificial intelligence such as deductive databases and knowledge representation and reasoning. Disjunctive existential rules (a.k.a. disjunctive tuple-generating dependencies in the database literature) form such a prominent rule-based language. The goal of this work is to pinpoint the expressive power of disjunctive existential rules in terms of insightful model-theoretic properties. More precisely, given a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of relational structures, we show that $\mathcal{C}$ is axiomatizable via a finite set $\Sigma$ of disjunctive existential rules (i.e., $\mathcal{C}$ is precisely the set of models of $\Sigma$) iff $\mathcal{C}$ enjoys certain model-theoretic properties. This is achieved by using the well-known property of criticality, a refined version of closure under direct products, and a novel property called diagrammatic compatibility that relies on the method of diagrams. We further establish analogous characterizations for the well-behaved classes of linear and guarded disjunctive existential rules by adopting refined versions of diagrammatic compatibility that consider the syntactic restrictions imposed by linearity and guardedness; this illustrates the robustness of diagrammatic compatibility. We finally exploit diagrammatic compatibility to rewrite a set of guarded disjunctive existential rules into an equivalent set that falls in the weaker class of linear disjunctive existential rules, if one exists.</description>

      <title>Reachability is Decidable for ATM-Typable Finitary PCF with Effect Handlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the reachability problem for simply-typed lambda calculus with recursive definitions and finite base-type values (finitary PCF) is decidable. A recent paper by Dal Lago and Ghyselen has shown that the same problem becomes undecidable when the language is extended with algebraic effect and handlers (effect handlers). We show that, perhaps surprisingly, the problem becomes decidable even with effect handlers when the type system is extended with answer type modification (ATM). A natural intuition may find the result contradictory, because one would expect allowing ATM makes more programs typable. Indeed, this intuition is correct in that there are programs that are typable with ATM but not without it, as we shall show in the paper. However, a corollary of our decidability result is that the converse is true as well: there are programs that are typable without ATM but becomes untypable with ATM, and we will show concrete examples of such programs in the paper. Our decidability result is proven by a novel continuation passing style (CPS) transformation that transforms an ATM-typable finitary PCF program with effect handlers to a finitary PCF program without effect handlers. Additionally, as another application of our CPS transformation, we show that every recursive-function-free ATM-typable finitary PCF program with effect handlers terminates, while there are (necessarily ATM-untypable) recursive-function-free finitary PCF programs with effect handlers that may diverge. Finally, we disprove a claim made in a recent work that proved a similar but strictly weaker decidability result. We foresee our decidability result to lay a foundation for developing verification methods for programs with effect handlers, just as the decidability result for reachability of finitary PCF has done such for programs without effect handlers.</description>

      <title>From Interpolating Formulas to Separating Languages and Back Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, research on Craig interpolation is concerned with (a) establishing the Craig interpolation property (CIP) of a logic saying that every valid implication in the logic has a Craig interpolant and (b) designing algorithms that extract Craig interpolants from proofs. Logics that lack the CIP are regarded as `pathological' and excluded from consideration. In this chapter, we survey variations and generalisations of traditional Craig interpolation. First, we consider Craig interpolants for implications in logics without the CIP, focusing on the decidability and complexity of deciding their existence. We then generalise interpolation by looking for Craig interpolants in languages L' that can be weaker than the language L of the given implication. Thus, do not only we restrict the non-logical symbols of Craig interpolants but also the logical ones. The resulting L/L'-interpolation problem generalises L/L'-definability, the question whether an L-formula is equivalent to some L'-formula. After that, we move from logical languages to formal languages where interpolation disguises itself as separation: given two disjoint languages in a class C, does there exist a separating language in a smaller class C'? This question is particularly well-studied in the case when the input languages are regular and the separating language is first-order definable. Finally, we connect the different research strands by showing how the decidability of the separation problem for regular languages can be used to prove the decidability of Craig interpolant existence for linear temporal logic LTL.</description>

      <title>Compositional Verification of Almost-Sure B\"uchi Objectives in MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the verification of almost-sure B\"uchi objectives in MDPs with a known, compositional structure based on string diagrams. In particular, we ask whether there is a strategy that ensures that a B\"uchi objective is almost-surely satisfied. We first show that proper exit sets -- the sets of exits that can be reached within a component without losing locally -- together with the reachability of a B\"uchi state are a sufficient and necessary statistic for the compositional verification of almost-sure B\"uchi objectives. The number of proper exit sets may grow exponentially in the number of exits. We define two algorithms: (1) A straightforward bottom-up algorithm that computes this statistic in a recursive manner to obtain the verification result of the entire string diagram and (2) a polynomial-time iterative algorithm which avoids computing all proper exit sets by performing iterative strategy refinement.</description>

      <title>Discovering Expert-Level Nash Equilibrium Algorithms with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithm design and analysis is a cornerstone of computer science, but it confronts a major challenge. Proving an algorithm's performance guarantee across all inputs has traditionally required extensive and often error-prone human effort. While AI has shown great success in finding solutions to specific problem instances, automating the discovery of general algorithms with such provable guarantees has remained a significant barrier. This challenge stems from the difficulty of integrating the creative process of algorithm design with the rigorous process of formal analysis. To address this gap, we propose LegoNE, a framework that tightly fuses these two processes for the fundamental and notoriously difficult problem of computing approximate Nash equilibria. LegoNE automatically translates any algorithm written by a simple Python-like language into a constrained optimization problem. Solving this problem derives and proves the algorithm's approximation bound. Using LegoNE, a state-of-the-art large language model rediscovered the state-of-the-art algorithm for two-player games within hours, a feat that had taken human researchers 15 years to achieve. For three-player games, the model discovered a novel algorithm surpassing all existing human-designed ones. This work demonstrates a new human-machine collaborative paradigm for theoretical science: humans reason at a higher-abstract level, using symbols to compress the search space, and AI explores within it, achieving what neither could alone.</description>

      <title>Filling in the semantics for intuitionistic conditional logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove completeness results for a wide variety of intuitionistic conditional logics. We do so by first using a duality to transfer algebraic completeness to completeness with respect to conditional Esakia spaces, a topologised version of a conditional Kripke frame. We then use so-called fill-ins to obtain completeness results with respect to classes conditional of Kripke frames. The fill-ins close the gap between conditional Esakia spaces, which do not have a canonical underlying frame, and conditional Kripke frames.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Functional Interpretation with Informative Types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a new approach to functional interpretations based on uniform quantification and relativization. The uniform quantification in the background permits a more penetrating analysis of principles related to collection and contra-collection. Relativization comes from a computationally informative notion of being an element of a given type. The approach is flexible. When the information takes the shape of bounds, we can recapture a form of the combination of G\"odel's functional dialectica interpretation with majorizability. When the information is "canonical" in function types, we obtain new functional interpretations and new models of G\"odel's theory T.</description>

      <title>SPARQL in N3: SPARQL CONSTRUCT as a rule language for the Semantic Web (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning in the Semantic Web (SW) commonly uses Description Logics (DL) via OWL2 DL ontologies, or SWRL for variables and Horn clauses. The Rule Interchange Format (RIF) offers more expressive rules but is defined outside RDF and rarely adopted. For querying, SPARQL is a well-established standard operating directly on RDF triples. We leverage SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries as logic rules, enabling (1) an expressive, familiar SW rule language, and (2) general recursion, where queries can act on the results of others. We translate these queries to the Notation3 Logic (N3) rule language, allowing use of existing reasoning machinery with forward and backward chaining. Targeting a one-to-one query-rule mapping improves exchangeability and interpretability. Benchmarks indicate competitive performance, aiming to advance the potential of rule-based reasoning in the SW.</description>

      <title>Complete Dynamic Logic of Communicating Hybrid Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a relatively complete proof calculus for the dynamic logic of communicating hybrid programs dLCHP. Beyond hybrid systems, communicating hybrid programs not only feature mixed discrete and continuous dynamics but also their parallel interactions in parallel hybrid systems. This not only combines the subtleties of hybrid and discrete parallel systems, but parallel hybrid dynamics necessitates that all parallel subsystems synchronize in time and evolve truly simultaneously. To enable compositional reasoning nevertheless, dLCHP combines differential dynamic logic dL with mutual abstraction of subsystems by assumption-commitment (ac) reasoning. The resulting proof calculus preserves the essence of dynamic logic axiomatizations, while revealing-and being driven by-a new modal logic view onto ac-reasoning. The dLCHP proof calculus is shown to be complete relative to $\Omega$-FOD, the first-order logic of differential equation properties FOD augmented with communication traces. This confirms that the calculus covers all aspects of parallel hybrid systems, because it lacks no axioms to reduce all their dynamical effects to the assertion logic. Additional axioms for encoding communication traces enable a provably correct equitranslation between $\Omega$-FOD and FOD, which reveals the possibility of representational succinctness in parallel hybrid systems proofs. Transitively, this establishes a full proof-theoretical alignment of dLCHP and dL, and shows that reasoning about parallel hybrid systems is exactly as hard as reasoning about hybrid systems, continuous systems, or discrete systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Program synthesis is the task of automatically constructing a program conforming to a given specification. In this paper we focus on synthesis of single-invocation recursion-free functions conforming to a specification given as a logical formula in the presence of uncomputable symbols (i.e., symbols used in the specification but not allowed in the resulting function). We approach the problem via SMT-solving methods: we present a quantifier elimination algorithm using model-based projections for both total and partial function synthesis, working with theories of uninterpreted functions and linear arithmetic and their combination. For this purpose we also extend model-based projection to produce witnesses for these theories. Further, we present procedures tailored for the case of uniquely determined solutions. We implemented a prototype of the algorithms using the SMT-solver Z3, demonstrating their practical efficiency compared to the state of the art.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the relation between model-based quantifier instantiation (MBQI) and enumerative instantiation (EI) in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). MBQI operates at the semantic level and guarantees to find a counterexample to a given a non-model. However, it may lead to weak instantiations. In contrast, EI strives for completeness by systematically enumerating terms at the syntactic level. However, such terms may not be counter-examples. Here we investigate the relation between the two techniques and report on our initial experiments of the proposed algorithm that combines the two.</description>

      <title>A SHACL-based Data Consistency Solution for Contract Compliance Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there have been many developments for GDPR-compliant data access and sharing based on consent. For more complex data sharing scenarios, where consent might not be sufficient, many parties rely on contracts. Before a contract is signed, it must undergo the process of contract negotiation within the contract lifecycle, which consists of negotiating the obligations associated with the contract. Contract compliance verification (CCV) provides a means to verify whether a contract is GDPR-compliant, i.e., adheres to legal obligations and there are no violations. The rise of knowledge graph (KG) adoption, enabling semantic interoperability using well-defined semantics, allows CCV to be applied on KGs. In the scenario of different participants negotiating obligations, there is a need for data consistency to ensure that CCV is done correctly. Recent work introduced the automated contracting tool (ACT), a KG-based and ODRL-employing tool for GDPR CCV, which was developed in the Horizon 2020 project smashHit (https://smashhit.eu). Although the tool reports violations with respect to obligations, it had limitations in verifying and ensuring compliance, as it did not use an interoperable semantic formalism, such as SHACL, and did not support users in resolving data inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations of ACT. We semi-automatically resolve CCV inconsistencies by providing repair strategies, which automatically propose (optimal) solutions to the user to re-establish data consistency and thereby support them in managing GDPR-compliant contract lifecycle data. We have implemented the approach, integrated it into ACT and tested its correctness and performance against basic CCV consistency requirements.</description>

      <title>Robust Topology and the Hausdorff-Smyth Monad on Metric Spaces over Continuous Quantales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a (preorder-enriched) category $\mathsf{Met}$ of quantale-valued metric spaces and uniformly continuous maps, with the essential requirement that the quantales are continuous. For each object $(X,d,Q)$ in this category, where $X$ is the carrier set, $Q$ is a continuous quantale, and $d: X \times X \to Q$ is the metric, we consider a topology $\tau_d$ on $X$, which generalizes the open ball topology, and a topology $\tau_{d,R}$ on the powerset $\mathsf{P}(X)$, called the robust topology, which captures robustness with respect to small perturbations of parameters. We define a (preorder-enriched) monad $\mathsf{P}_S$ on $\mathsf{Met}$, called the Hausdorff-Smyth monad, which captures the robust topology, in the sense that the open ball topology of the object $\mathsf{P}_S(X,d,Q)$ coincides with the robust topology $\tau_{d,R}$ for the object $(X,d,Q)$. We prove that every topology arises from a quantale-valued metric. As such, our framework provides a foundation for quantitative reasoning about imprecision and robustness in a wide range of computational and physical systems.</description>

      <title>Ext groups in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ext groups are fundamental homological invariants which have important applications in homotopy theory and algebra. In particular, they appear in the classical universal coefficient theorem, a key computational tool in homotopy theory. Motivated by the goal of extending such tools to synethetic homotopy theory, we develop the theory of Yoneda Ext groups [Yon54] over a ring in homotopy type theory (HoTT) and describe their interpretation into an $\infty$-topos. The Yoneda approach to Ext groups does not require projective or injective resolutions, which is a crucial in HoTT since we do not know that such resolutions exist. While it produces group objects that are a priori, we show that the $\mathrm{Ext}^1$ groups are equivalent to small groups, leaving open the question of whether the higher Ext groups are essentially small as well. We also show that the $\mathrm{Ext}^1$ groups take on the usual form as a product of cyclic groups whenever the input modules are finitely presented and the ring is a PID (in the constructive sense).
  When interpreted into an $\infty$-topos of sheaves on a 1-category, our Ext groups recover (and give a resolution-free approach to) sheaf Ext groups, which arise in algebraic geometry [Gro57]. (These are also called "local" Ext groups.) We may therefore interpret results about Ext from HoTT and apply them to sheaf Ext. To show this, we prove that injectivity of modules in HoTT interprets to internal injectivity in these models. It follows, for example, that sheaf Ext can be computed using resolutions which are projective or injective in the sense of HoTT, when they exist, and we give an example of this in the projective case. We also discuss the relation between internal $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules (for a $0$-truncated group object $G$) and abelian groups in the slice over $BG$, and study the interpretation of our Ext groups in both settings.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Autonomous Driving Policies using a Neuro-Symbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of driving environments and the presence of diverse road users pose significant challenges for decision-making in autonomous driving. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a popular approach to tackle this problem. However, the application of existing DRL solutions is mainly confined to simulated environments due to safety concerns, impeding their deployment in real-world. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic model-free DRL approach, called DRL with Symbolic Logic (DRLSL) that combines the strengths of DRL (learning from experience) and symbolic first-order logic (knowledge-driven reasoning) to enable safe learning in real-time interactions of autonomous driving within real environments. This innovative approach provides a means to learn autonomous driving policies by actively engaging with the physical environment while ensuring safety. We have implemented the DRLSL framework in a highway driving scenario using the HighD dataset and demonstrated that our method successfully avoids unsafe actions during both the training and testing phases. Furthermore, our results indicate that DRLSL achieves faster convergence during training and exhibits better generalizability to new highway driving scenarios compared to traditional DRL methods.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Isometric Reductions Between Infinite Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the recursion-theoretic aspects of large-scale geometries of infinite strings, a subject initiated by Khoussainov and Takisaka (2017). We investigate several notions of quasi-isometric reductions between recursive infinite strings and prove various results on the equivalence classes of such reductions. The main result is the construction of two infinite recursive strings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha$ is strictly quasi-isometrically reducible to $\beta$, but the reduction cannot be made recursive. This answers an open problem posed by Khoussainov and Takisaka.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce partial Markov categories as a synthetic framework for synthetic probabilistic inference, blending the work of Cho and Jacobs, Fritz, and Golubtsov on Markov categories with the work of Cockett and Lack on cartesian restriction categories. We describe observations, Bayes' theorem, normalisation, and both Pearl's and Jeffrey's updates in purely categorical terms.</description>

      <title>Why Cannot Large Language Models Ever Make True Correct Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are trumpeting the "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The present author considers that the so-called "reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the ability of true correct reasoning.</description>
