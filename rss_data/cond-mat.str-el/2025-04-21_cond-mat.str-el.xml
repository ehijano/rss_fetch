      <title>Probing Loop Currents and Collective Modes of Charge Density Waves in Kagome Materials with NV Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order with loop currents has attracted considerable attention in the Kagome material family AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs). However, experimental signatures of loop current order remain elusive. In this work, based on the mean-field free energy, we analyze the collective modes of unconventional CDW order in a Kagome lattice model. Furthermore, we point out that phase modes in the imaginary CDW (iCDW) order with loop current orders result in time-dependent stray fields. We thus propose using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to detect these time-dependent stray fields, providing a potential experimental approach to identifying loop current order.</description>

      <title>$\Sigma$-Attention: A Transformer-based operator learning framework for self-energy in strongly correlated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\Sigma$-Attention, a Transformer-based operator-learning framework to address a key computational challenge in correlated materials. Our approach utilizes an Encoder-Only Transformer as an ansatz to approximate the self-energy operator of strongly correlated electronic systems. By creating a batched dataset that combines results from three complementary approaches: many-body perturbation theory, strong-coupling expansion, and exact diagonalization, each effective in specific parameter regimes, $\Sigma$-Attention is applied to learn a universal approximation for the self-energy operator that is valid across all regimes. This hybrid strategy leverages the strengths of existing methods while relying on the transformer's ability to generalize beyond individual limitations. More importantly, the scalability of the Transformer architecture allows the learned self-energy to be extended to systems with larger sizes, leading to much improved computational scaling. Using the 1D Hubbard model, we demonstrate that $\Sigma$-Attention can accurately predict the Matsubara Green's function and hence effectively captures the Mott transition at finite temperature. Our framework offers a promising and scalable pathway for studying strongly correlated systems with many possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>A Review on the Applications of Density Functional Theory to the FQH System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect remains a captivating area in condensed matter physics, characterized by strongly correlated topological order, fractionalized excitations, and anyonic statistics. Numerical simulations, such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, matrix product states, and Monte Carlo methods, are essential to examine the properties of strongly correlated systems. Recently, density functional theory (DFT) has been employed in this field within the framework of composite fermion (CF) theory. In this paper, we assess how DFT addresses major challenges in FQH system, such as computing ground state and low-energy excitations. We emphasize the critical insights provided by DFT-based methods into the CF model, edge effects, and the nature of fractional charge and magnetoroton excitations. Furthermore, we examine the advantages and limitations of DFT approaches, highlight the interplay between numerical simulations and theoretical models. We finally discuss the future potential of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) for modeling non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetism in spin-orbit coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Unconventional magnetism" was proposed to describe the exotic states arising from Landau-Pomeranchuk instabilities in the spin channel nearly two decades ago. Its odd-partial-wave-channel (e.g. $p$-wave) states break parity giving rise to the dynamic generation of spin-orbit coupling, while its even-partial-wave-channel (e.g. $d$-wave) states break time-reversal symmetry. Both types of states can exhibit collinear and non-collinear spin configurations over Fermi surfaces with the former and latter termed as the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-phases, respectively. The collinear states in even partial-wave channels are in the same symmetry class of ``altermagnetism". In this work, we investigate unconventional magnetism in both $p$- and $d$-wave channels within spin-orbit coupled systems with parity and time-reversal symmetries maintained. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau free energy analysis, the $p$-wave channel yields the gyrotropic, Rashba, Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit couplings. They compete and mix evolving from the $\beta$-phase to the $\alpha$-phase with various types of spin-momentum lockings. Analyses are performed in parallel for the $d$-wave unconventional magnetism. We emphasize that the single-particle dispersion is not sufficient to justify the spin-group type symmetry of the full Hamiltonian. Furthermore, Goldstone manifolds and excitations are examined in each unconventional magnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Gapless behavior in a two-leg spin ladder with bond randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We successfully synthesized [Cu$_2$(AcO)$_4$($p$-Py-V-$p$-F)$_2$]$\cdot$4CHCl$_3$, a verdazyl-based complex with a paddlewheel structure comprising two Cu atoms, which induces strong antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions between Cu spins, generating a nonmagnetic singlet state at low temperatures. Two primary exchange interactions between radical spins generate a spin-1/2 AF two-leg ladder. In addition, two possible positional configurations of the F atom in the complex create four different overlap patterns of molecular orbitals, introducing bond randomness in the spin ladder. The observed experimental behaviors, such as the Curie tail in the magnetic susceptibility and the gapless gradual increase in the magnetization curve, are attributed to a broad distribution of excitation energies and a few orphan spins in the random-singlet (RS) state that are stabilized by bond randomness. The low-temperature specific heat exhibits a temperature dependence with $\propto 1/|{\rm{ln}}T|^3$, demonstrating the formation of the RS state in unfrustrated systems. We also consider the effect of restricted patterns of exchange interactions and one-dimensional nature of the system on the RS state.</description>

      <title>The phase diagram of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ for out-of-plane magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{\textrm{c}} = 0.35\, \textrm{K}$) shows two superconducting (SC) phases, SC1 and SC2, when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the $c$ axis of the tetragonal unit cell. All experiments to date indicate that the change in SC order parameter detected at $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H^{*} \approx 4\, \textrm{T}$ is due to strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the Ce sites caused by the locally non-centrosymmetric environments of the otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystalline structure. Another phase (phase I) exists in this material below $T_{\textrm{0}} = 0.54\, \textrm{K}$. In a previous specific heat study [K. Semeniuk et al. Phys. Rev. B, $107$, L220504 (2023)] we have shown that phase I persists up to a field $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H_{0} \approx 6\, \textrm{T}$, larger than $H^{*}$. From thermodynamic arguments we expected the phase-I boundary line to cross phase SC2 at a tetracritical point. However, we could not find any signature of the phase-I line inside the SC2 phase and speculated that this was due to the fact that the $T_{0}(H)$ line is almost perpendicular to the $H$ axis and, therefore, invisible to $T$-dependent measurements. This would imply a weak competition between the two order parameters. Here, we report magnetic field dependent measurements of the magnetostriction and ac-susceptibility on high-quality single crystals. We see clear evidence of the singularity at $H_{0}$ inside the SC2 phase and confirm our previous prediction. Furthermore, we observe the transition across the $T^{*}(H)$ line in $T$-dependent specific heat measurements, which show that the $T^{*}(H)$ line is not perpendicular to the field axis, but has a positive slope. Our work supports recent $\mu$SR results which suggest coexistence of phase I with superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics and 1/3 magnetization plateau in a coupled distorted diamond chain compound K2Cu3(MoO4)4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of the $s$ = 1/2 compound K$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$(MoO$_{4}$)$_{4}$ by combining magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat, and electron spin resonance (ESR) with density functional calculations. Its monoclinic structure features alternating Cu$^{2+}$ ($s$ = 1/2) monomers and edge-shared dimers linked by MoO$_{4}$ units, forming a distorted diamond chain along the $a$-axis. Antiferromagnetic order occurs at $T_{\rm N}$ = 2.3 K, as evident from a $\lambda$-type anomaly in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility derivatives. Inverse magnetic susceptibility reveals coexisting ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions. Specific heat and ESR data show two characteristic temperatures: one at 20 K, associated with spin-singlet formation in Cu$_{2}$O$_{9}$ dimers, and another at 3.68 K, indicating short-range correlations between dimers and monomers. Magnetization measurements reveal a metamagnetic transition at 2.6 T and a critical magnetic field $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ = 3.4 T, where a 1/3 magnetization plateau emerges with saturation near 0.35 $\mu_{\rm B}$. Low-temperature specific heat and magnetization data reveal the suppression of long-range order at $\mu_{0}H_{c}$, enabling the construction of a temperature-magnetic field phase diagram showing multiple magnetic phases near the $\mu_{0}H_{c}$. Density functional theory confirms a distorted diamond chain with $J_{1}$ dimers and competing $J_2$, $J_4$, $J_3$, and $J_5$ interactions with monomer spins as an effective low-temperature spin model.</description>

      <title>Predicting fermionic densities using a Projected Quantum Kernel method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a support vector regressor based on a projected quantum kernel method to predict the density structure of 1D fermionic systems of interest in quantum chemistry and quantum matter. The kernel is built on with the observables of a quantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and test data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional Theory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian parameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of measurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the method outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive with the radial basis function method.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for determining material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium using experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach is based on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends only on a single material parameter, $\mu$. Therefore, the fitting method is easy to implement, as it compares calculated magnetoexciton energies with experimental data to determine the true exciton reduced mass, the best-fit value of $\mu$. By applying this method, we extract material parameters $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs (WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$) encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. Additionally, we provide key material properties such as diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii, which are calculated using the extracted parameters.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem distinguishing non-integrability and the lowest-order Yang-Baxter equation for isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$. We prove a dichotomy theorem that a single relation sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system is non-integrable, or (ii) the lowest-order Yang-Baxter equation is satisfied. This result solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture stating that a model is integrable only if this model has a 3-local conserved quantity. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>General trends of electronic structures, superconducting pairing, and magnetic correlations in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate $m$-layered superconductors La$_{m+1}$Ni$_{m}$O$_{3m+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6) under pressure. Our results suggest that, while these Ruddlesden-Popper layered nickelates display many similarities, they also show noticeable differences. The Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals display bonding-antibonding, or bonding-antibonding-nonbonding, characteristic splittings, depending on the even or odd number of stacking layers $m$. In addition, the ratio of the in-plane interorbital hopping between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and in-plane intraorbital hopping between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals was found to be large in La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6), and this ratio increases from $m = 1$ to $m = 6$, suggesting that the in-plane hybridization will increase as the layer number $m$ increases. In contrast to the dominant $s^\pm$--wave state driven by spin fluctuations in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, two nearly degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s^\pm$-wave leading states were obtained in the four-layer stacking La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and five-layer stacking La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$. The leading $s^\pm$-wave state was recovered in the six-layer material La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$. In general, at the level of the random phase approximation treatment, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ decreases in stoichiometric bulk systems from the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to the six-layer La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, despite the $m$ dependent dominant pairing. Both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic correlations are found to be quite complex. Within the in-plane direction, we obtained the peak of the magnetic susceptibility at ${\bf q} = (0.6 \pi, 0.6 \pi)$ for La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, and at ${\bf q} = (0.7 \pi, 0.7 \pi)$ for La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$.</description>

      <title>Gauging Quantum Phases: A Matrix Product State Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of matrix product states, we investigate gauging as a method for exploring quantum phases of matter. Specifically, we describe how symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases in one-dimensional spin systems behave under twisted gauging, a generalization of the well-known gauging procedure for globally symmetric states. Compared to previous, order parameter--based, approaches our analysis is not limited to the case of maximally non-commutative (MNC) phases and we use our findings to propose a generalization of the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation to the non-MNC setting. A key result of our work is that gauging produces configurations characterized by a combination of MNC order and symmetry breaking, when applied to non-MNC SPT phases. More generally, we conjecture a precise correspondence between SSB and non-MNC SPT phases, possibly enabling the detection of such phases using local and string order parameters.</description>

      <title>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic spectra with paramagnon fractionalization in the single band Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the spectral properties of a recently proposed theory of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of the cuprates. We show that this theory can be obtained from the familiar paramagnon theory of nearly antiferromagnetic metals by fractionalizing the paramagnon into two `hidden' layers of S=1/2 spins. The first hidden layer of spins hybridizes with the electrons as in a Kondo lattice heavy Fermi liquid, while the second hidden layer of spins forms a spin liquid with fractionalized spinon excitations. We compute the imaginary part of the electronic self energy induced by the spinon excitations. The energy and momentum dependence of the photoemission spectrum across the Brillouin zone provides a good match to observations by He et al. in Bi2201 (Science 331, 1579 (2011)) and by Chen et al. in Bi2212 (Science 366, 1099 (2019)).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06062v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations and minimally augmented spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that the phase diagram of the quantum $S\!=\!\frac12$ $J_1$--$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic model on the honeycomb lattice differs dramatically from the classical one. It hosts the double-zigzag and Ising-z phases as unexpected intermediaries between ferromagnetic and zigzag states that are also extended beyond their classical regions of stability. In broad agreement with quantum order-by-disorder arguments, these collinear phases replace the classical spiral state.</description>

      <title>Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $\pi$-flux Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</description>

      <title>Emergence of nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles across the transition from the pseudogap metal to the d-wave superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the pseudogap state of the hole- and electron-doped cuprates as a metal with hole and/or electron pocket Fermi surfaces. In the absence of long-range antiferromagnetism, such Fermi surfaces violate the Luttinger requirement of enclosing the same area as free electrons at the same density. Using the Ancilla theory of such a pseudogap state, we describe the onset of conventional $d$-wave superconductivity by the condensation of a charge e Higgs boson transforming as a fundamental under the emergent SU(2) gauge symmetry of a background $\pi$-flux spin liquid. In all cases, we find that the $d$-wave superconductor has gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points on the Brillouin zone diagonals with significant velocity anisotropy, just as in the BCS state. This includes the case of the electron-doped pseudogap metal with only electron pockets centered at wavevectors $(\pi, 0)$, $(0, \pi)$, and an electronic gap along the zone diagonals. Remarkably, in this case too, gapless nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles emerge within the gap at 4 points along the zone diagonals upon the onset of superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: The Mott system with a low-energy excitation may well constitute the underlying system for high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) of under-doped cuprates. This manuscript explores the above through the Hubbard-1 approximation (the Green function method), especially in terms of its self-energy while evaluating the calculation of self-energy using effective mass ratio. Results show it appears the pseudo-gap of HTSC is due to the self-energy effect on the quasi-particle excitation of the Mott's J.</description>

      <title>Ground state phase diagram and the exotic phases in the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between frustration and spin chirality has the potential to give rise to unprecedented phases in frustrated quantum magnets. We examine the ground state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square lattice J1-J2-Jx model by employing critical level crossings and ground state fidelity susceptibility (FS) using exact diagonalization (ED) with full lattice symmetries. Our analysis reveals the evolution of highly symmetric energy levels as a function of J2 at fixed Jx. During a magnetic to non-magnetic phase transition, the precise identification of the phase boundary is achieved through critical level crossings between the gapless excitation of a magnetic phase and the quasi-degenerate ground state of a non-magnet phase. Conversely, a direct transition between two non-magnetic phases is characterized by a FS peak accompanied by an avoided ground state level crossing, serving as a distinctive signal. Within a substantial range of Jx, we identify an anticipated chiral spin liquid (CSL) state and an adjacent nematic spin liquid (NSL) phase with a degeneracy of two on a cylinder. These two phases are demarcated by a nearly vertical boundary line at J2 = 0.65. This critical line terminates at the lower boundary of a magnetic ordered chiral spin solid (CSS) phase. We validate the topological nature of the CSL using the modular S matrix of the minimum entangled states (MES) on a torus, along with the entanglement spectra (ES) of even and odd sectors on a cylinder, employing an SU(2)-symmetric density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. Furthermore, we delve into a comprehensive discussion on the nature of the NSL, exploring aspects such as ground state degeneracy, the local bond energy landscape, and the singlet and triplet gaps on various tori. These analysis provide substantial evidence supporting the nematic nature of the NSL.</description>

      <title>Learning eigenstates of quantum many-body Hamiltonians within the symmetric subspaces using neural network quantum states</title>

Abstract: The exploration of neural network quantum states has become widespread in the studies of complicated quantum many-body systems. However, achieving high precision remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space size and the intricate sign structures. Utilizing symmetries of the physical system, we propose a method to evaluate and sample the variational ansatz within a symmetric subspace. This approach isolates different symmetry sectors, reducing the relevant Hilbert space size by a factor approximately proportional to the size of the symmetry group. It is inspired by exact diagonalization techniques and the work of Choo et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 167204 (2018). We validate our method using the frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain and compare its performance to the case without symmetrization. The results indicate that our symmetric subspace approach achieves a substantial improvement over the full Hilbert space on optimizing the ansatz, reducing the energy error by orders of magnitude. We also compare the results on degenerate eigenstates with different quantum numbers, highlighting the advantage of operating within a smaller Hilbert subspace.</description>

Abstract: The bootstrap method aims to solve problems by imposing constraints on the space of physical observables, which often follow from physical assumptions such as positivity and symmetry. Here, we employ a bootstrap approach to study interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level by minimizing the energy as a function of the static structure factor subject to a set of constraints, bypassing the need to construct the full many-body wavefunction. This approach rigorously lower bounds the ground state energy, making it complementary to conventional variational upper bounds. We show that the lower bound we obtain is relatively tight, within at most 5\% from the ground state energy computed with exact diagonalization (ED) at small system sizes, and generally gets tighter as we include more constraints. In addition to energetics, our results reproduce the correct power law dependence of the pair correlation function at short distances and the existence of a large entanglement gap in the two-particle entanglement spectra for the Laughlin states at $\nu = 1/3$. We further identify signatures of the composite Fermi liquid state close to half-filling. This shows that the bootstrap approach is capable, in principle, of describing non-trivial gapped topologically ordered, as well as gapless, phases. At the end, we will discuss possible extensions and limitations of this approach. Our work establishes numerical bootstrap as a promising method to study many-body phases in topological bands, paving the way to its application in moir\'e platforms where the energetic competition between fractional quantum anomalous Hall, symmetry broken, and gapless states remains poorly understood.</description>

Abstract: A theory of the normal and superconducting states of piezomagnetic metals, which are altermagnetic materials, has been developed. This has been done in comparison with the corresponding theoretical description for metals that do not have spatial inversion symmetry. Particular attention has been paid to the problem of the anomalous Hall effect, and its absence has been demonstrated in both altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric metals. It has been shown that the superconducting state in altermagnets always arises by pairing electrons from zones split by spin-orbit interaction, which makes the existence of such superconductors unlikely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong electron-electron interaction can induce Mott insulating state, which is believed to host unusual correlated phenomena such as quantum spin liquid when quantum fluctuation dominates and unconventional superconductivity through doping. Transition metal compounds as correlated materials provide a versatile platform to engineer the Mott insulating state. Previous studies mostly focused on the controlling of the repulsive interaction and bandwidth of the electrons by gating or doping. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on monolayer 1T phase NbSe2, TaSe2, and TaS2 and directly observed their band structures with characteristic lower Hubbard bands. By systematically investigating the orbital textures and temperature dependence of the energy gap of the materials in this family, we discovered that hybridization of the chalcogen p states with lower Hubbard band stabilizes the Mott phase via tuning of the bandwidth, as shown by a significant increase of the transition temperature (TC) at a stronger hybridization strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism for realizing a robust Mott insulating phase and establish monolayer 1T phase transition metal dichalcogenide family as a promising platform for exploring correlated electron problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of topological phases in the SO($n$) spin chains using a combination of analytical parton construction and numerical techniques. For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate in close chains throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique in close chains. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is demonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.</description>

Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian transverse $XY$ model with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having $\mathcal{RT}$-symmetry, referred to as $iKSEA$ model, possesses both an exceptional point at which eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the $iKSEA$ model, which is a lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales as $N^2$, with $N$ being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic limit. It indicates that reservoir engineering can provide enhanced precision of system parameters when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting in this non-Hermitian model. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that, in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is moderate. Moreover, we illustrate that starting from a product state, the non-Hermitian evolving Hamiltonian can create the dynamical state that surpasses the standard quantum limit in the broken regime.</description>
