      <title>Dedifferentiation stabilizes stem cell lineages: From CTMC to diffusion theory and thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stem-terminally differentiated (TD) lineages in small niches where demographic noise from discrete division and death events is non-negligible. Starting from a mechanistic five-channel, density-dependent CTMC (symmetric self-renewal, symmetric differentiation, asymmetric division, dedifferentiation, TD death), we derive its mean-field limit and a functional CLT, obtaining a chemical Langevin diffusion whose explicit state-dependent covariance exactly matches the CTMC's aggregated channel-wise infinitesimal covariances. Within this diffusion approximation we remove the dedifferentiation flux and obtain a sharp dichotomy: in subcritical regimes the stem coordinate becomes extinct asymptotically almost surely, whereas in supercritical regimes polynomial moments diverge exponentially. This identifies, at the diffusion level, a structural failure mode of strictly hierarchical lineages under demographic fluctuations and clarifies how a cyclic return flux can rescue homeostasis. For interpretation we also derive an exact totals ODE backbone from a damage-structured transport model and obtain two steady-state constraints (ratio and equalization laws) linking compartment ratios to turnover and balancing dedifferentiation against fate bias. Numerical experiments corroborate the $\Omega^{-1/2}$ fluctuation scaling, illustrate the pathology, and contrast theorem-regime global convergence with threshold (Allee-type) behaviour outside the theorem hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Collective behavior based on agent-environment interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of active particles interacting through a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, leading to emergent collective behaviors without direct agent-to-agent communication. Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.</description>

      <title>Stability and Vibrations of Proteins in Vacuum and Water: Bridging Quantum Accuracy and Force-Field Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting biomolecular thermodynamics and spectroscopy requires accurate relative energies of metastable states and local curvatures on the potential-energy surface. We show that the general-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field (MLFF) reproduces PBE0+MBD density-functional theory with unprecedented fidelity across bio-relevant molecules spanning sizes and complexities far beyond its training dataset. For 23 small molecules, SO3LR captures harmonic and anharmonic vibrational features, including frequencies, displacement patterns, and IR spectra. We perform detailed dynamical studies of the amino acid oF-Phe+, folding of the alanine-15 peptide, and assembly of monomeric p53 transactivation domains into tetramers, in vacuum and water. SO3LR consistently reproduces DFT-level potential-energy surfaces, vibrational densities of states, and mode eigenvectors, capturing anharmonicity, polarization, and medium-range environment-driven interactions crucial for proteins. Our results establish that MLFF-driven dynamics provide a quantum-accurate picture of metastable minima and vibrational properties, achieving DFT-level accuracy at force-field computational cost and opening new possibilities for the computational study of biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Searching for Quantum Effects in the Brain: A Bell-Type Test for Nonclassical Latent Representations in Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether neural information processing is entirely classical or involves quantum-mechanical elements remains an open question. Here we propose a model-agnostic, information-theoretic test of nonclassicality that bypasses microscopic assumptions and instead probes the structure of neural representations themselves. Using autoencoders as a transparent model system, we introduce a Bell-type consistency test in latent space, and ask whether decoding statistics obtained under multiple readout contexts can be jointly explained by a single positive latent-variable distribution. By shifting the search for quantum-like signatures in neural systems from microscopic dynamics to experimentally testable constraints on information processing, this work opens a new route for probing the fundamental physics of neural computation.</description>
