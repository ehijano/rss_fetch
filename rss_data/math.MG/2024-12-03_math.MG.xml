      <title>On Nearly Optimal Paper Moebius Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon&lt;1/384$ and let
  $\Omega$ be a smooth embedded paper Moebius
  band of aspect
  ratio less than $\sqrt 3 + \epsilon$. We prove that
  $\Omega$ is within Hausdorff distance
  $18 \sqrt \epsilon$ of an equilateral triangle of
  perimeter $2 \sqrt 3$. This
  is an effective and fairly sharp version of our recent theorems in [{\bf S0\/}] about
  the optimal paper Moebius band.</description>

      <title>H\"older equivalence of a class of Bara\'nski carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Lipschitz equivalence of fractals is a very active topic in recent years, but there are very few results on non-totally disconnected fractals. In this paper, we use a class of finite state automata, called feasible $\Sigma$-automata, to construct pseudo-metric spaces, and then apply them to the classification of self-affine sets. We first recall a notion of neighbor automaton, and we show that an neighbor automaton satisfying the finite type condition is a feasible $\Sigma$-automaton. Secondly, we construct a universal map to show that pseudo-metric spaces induced by different automata can be bi-Lipschitz equivalent. As an application, we obtain a rather general sufficient condition for Bara\'nski carpets to be Lipschitz equivalent.</description>

      <title>Variations on five-dimensional sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze Sz\"oll\H{o}si's recent construction of a five-dimensional kissing configuration and produce a new such configuration, the fourth to be discovered. We construct five-dimensional sphere packings from these configurations, which augment Conway and Sloane's list of conjecturally optimal packings, and we also construct a new kissing configuration in nine dimensions. None of these constructions improves on the known records, but they provide geometrically distinct constructions achieving these records.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of Wasserstein barycenter I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Wasserstein barycenter problem in the setting of non-compact, non-smooth extended metric measure spaces. We introduce a couple of new concepts and obtain the existence, uniqueness, absolute continuity of the Wasserstein barycenter, and prove Jensen's inequality in an abstract framework.
  This generalized several results on Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds and Alexandrov spaces, to metric measure spaces satisfying Riemannian Curvature-Dimension condition \`a la Lott--Sturm--Villani, and some extended metric measure spaces including abstract Wiener spaces and configuration spaces over Riemannian manifolds.
  We also introduce a new curvature-dimesion condition, we call Barycenter-Curvature-Dimension condition {\rm BCD}. We prove its stability under measured-Gromov--Hausdorff convergence and prove the existence of the Wasserstein barycenter under this new condition. In addition, we get some geometric inequalities including a multi-marginal Brunn--Minkowski inequality and a functional Blaschke--Santal\'o type inequality.</description>

      <title>On generalized metrics of Vandermonde type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of papers in the 1960's, S. G\"ahler defined and investigated so-called m-metric spaces and their topological properties. An m-metric assigns to any tuple of m+1 elements a real value (more generally an element in a partially odered set) which satisfies the generalized metric axioms of semidefiniteness, symmetry, and simplex inequality. In this contribution we consider a new type of generalized metric which is based on the Vandermonde determinant. We present some remarkable geometric consequences of the corresponding simplex inequality in the complex plane. Then we show that the Vandermonde principle of construction extends to linear spaces of arbitrary dimension by using symmetric multilinear maps of degree m(m + 1)/2. In particular, we analyze when this generalized metrics has the stronger property of definiteness. Finally, an application is provided to the m-metric of point sets when driven by the same linear ordinary differential equation.</description>

Abstract: The radial mean bodies of parameter $p&gt;-1$ of a convex body $K \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ are radial sets introduced in \cite{GZ98} by Gardner and Zhang. They are known to be convex for $p\geq 0$. We prove that if $K \subseteq \mathbb R^2$ is a convex body, then its radial mean body of parameter $p$ is convex for every $p \in (-1,0)$.</description>

      <title>The Hexagonal Tiling Honeycomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hexagonal tiling honeycomb is a beautiful structure in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. It is called {6,3,3} because each hexagon has 6 edges, 3 hexagons meet at each vertex in a Euclidean plane tiled by regular hexagons, and 3 such planes meet along each edge of this honeycomb. It also appears naturally in algebraic geometry. If $\mathbb{E}$ denotes the Eisenstein integers, the N\'eron-Severi group of the abelian surface $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{E}^2$ is isomorphic to the lattice $\mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{E})$ consisting of $2 \times 2$ hermitian matrices with Eisenstein integer entries. The points $A \in \mathfrak{h}_2(\mathbb{E})$ with $\mathrm{tr}(A) \gt 0$ and $\det(A) \gt 0$ come from ample line bundles on $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{E}^2$, and among these points, those with $\det(A) = 1$ correspond to principal polarizations. But these points are precisely the centers of the hexagons in the hexagonal tiling honeycomb!</description>

      <title>Relative simplicity of the universal coverings of transformation groups and Tsuboi's metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many transformation groups on manifolds are simple, but their universal coverings are not. In the present paper, we study the concept of relatively simple group, that is, a group with the maximum proper normal subgroup. We show that many examples of universal coverings of transformation groups are relatively simple, including the universal covering $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$ of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.
  Tsuboi constructed a metric space $\mathcal{M}(G)$ for a simple group $G$. We generalize his construction to relatively simple groups, and study their large scale geometric structure. In particular, Tsuboi's metric space of $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M, \omega)$ is not quasi-isometric to the half line for every closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.</description>

      <title>On weakly $1$-convex and weakly $1$-semiconvex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work concerns generalized convex sets in the real multi-dimensional Euclidean space, known as weakly $1$-convex and weakly $1$-semiconvex sets. An open set is called weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) if, through every boundary point of the set, there passes a straight line (a closed ray) not intersecting the set. A closed set is called weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) if it is approximated from the outside by a family of open weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) sets. A point of the complement of a set to the whole space is a $1$-nonconvexity ($1$-nonsemiconvexity) point of the set if every straight line passing through the point (every ray emanating from the point) intersects the set. It is proved that if the collection of all $1$-nonconvexity ($1$-nonsemiconvexity) points corresponding to an open weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) set is non-empty, then it is open. It is also proved that the non-empty interior of a closed weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex) set in the space is weakly $1$-convex (weakly $1$-semiconvex).</description>

      <title>A Conditional Upper Bound for the Moving Sofa Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moving sofa problem asks for the connected shape with the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway $L$ with unit width. The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as $2.2195\ldots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$. The lower bound $2.2195\ldots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\ldots$. The upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik using extensive computer assistance. It is conjectured that the equality $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ holds at the lower bound.
  We develop a new approach to the moving sofa problem by approximating it as an infinite-dimensional convex quadratic optimization problem. The problem is then explicitly solved using a calculus of variation based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory. Consequently, we prove that any moving sofa satisfying a property named the injectivity condition has an area of at most $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. The new conditional bound does not rely on any computer assistance, yet it is much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\ldots$ of Gerver than the computer-assisted upper bound $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik. Gerver's sofa $S_G$, the conjectured optimum, satisfies the injectivity condition in particular.</description>

      <title>A New Linear Programming Method in Sphere Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the linear programming method developed by Cohn and Elkies (Ann. Math. 157(2): 689-714, 2003), we introduce a new linear programming method to solve the sphere packing problem. More concretely, we consider sequences of auxiliary functions $\{g_m\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}^{+}}$, where $g_m$ is a $m\Lambda$-periodic auxiliary function defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $\Lambda$ being a given full-rank lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This new method extends the original approach and offers a greater flexibility. Furthermore, using this new linear programming framework, we construct several effective auxiliary functions for dimensions $n=1,2,3$. We hope this approach provides valuable insights into solving sphere packing problems for $n=2,3$ and even higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We provide a unified treatment of several results concerning full groups of ample groupoids and paradoxical decompositions attached to them. This includes a criterion for the full group of an ample groupoid being amenable as well as comparison of its orbit, Koopman and groupoid-left-regular representations. Besides that, we unify several recent results about paradoxicality in semigroups and groupoids, relating embeddings of Thompson's group V into full groups of ample \'etale groupoids.</description>

Abstract: We prove a synthetic Bonnet-Myers rigidity theorem for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces with global curvature bounded below by $K&lt;0$ and an open distance realizer of length $L=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{|K|}}$: It states that the space necessarily is a warped product with warping function $\cos:(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})\to\mathbb{R}_+$. From this, one also sees that a globally hyperbolic spacetime with curvature bounded above by $K&lt;0$ and an open distance realizer of length $L=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{|K|}}$ is a warped product with warping function $\cos$.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of 4-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a lattice in n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as the chromatic number of its Voronoi graph. The Voronoi graph is the Cayley graph on the lattice having the strict Voronoi vectors as generators. In this paper we determine the chromatic number of all 4-dimensional lattices. To achieve this we use the known classification of 52 parallelohedra in dimension 4. These 52 geometric types yield 16 combinatorial types of relevant Voronoi graphs. We discuss a systematic approach to checking for isomorphism of Cayley graphs of lattices. Lower bounds for the chromatic number are obtained from choosing appropriate small finite induced subgraphs of the Voronoi graphs. Matching upper bounds are derived from periodic colorings. To determine the chromatic numbers of these finite graphs, we employ a SAT solver.</description>

Abstract: We propose to study the restriction conjecture using decoupling theorems and two-ends Furstenberg inequalities. Specifically, we pose a two-ends Furstenberg conjecture, which implies the restriction conjecture. As evidence, we prove this conjecture in the plane by using the Furstenberg set estimate. Moreover, we use this planar result to prove a restriction estimate for $p&gt;22/7$ in three dimensions, which implies Wolff's $5/2$-hairbrush bound for Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Our approach also makes improvements for the restriction conjecture in higher dimensions.</description>
