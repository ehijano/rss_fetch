      <title>Linear Logic and Quantum Error Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a point of view on reduction of multiplicative proof nets based on quantum error-correcting codes. To each proof net we associate a code, in such a way that cut-elimination corresponds to error correction.</description>

      <title>Groupoidal Realizability for Intensional Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop realizability models of intensional type theory, based on groupoids, wherein realizers themselves carry non-trivial (non-discrete) homotopical structure. In the spirit of realizability, this is intended to formalize a homotopical BHK interpretation, whereby evidence for an identification is a path. Specifically, we study partitioned groupoidal assemblies. Categories of such are parameterised by "realizer categories" (instead of the usual partial combinatory algebras) that come equipped with an interval qua internal cogroupoid. The interval furnishes a notion of homotopy as well as a fundamental groupoid construction. Objects in a base groupoid are realized by points in the fundamental groupoid of some object from the realizer category; isomorphisms in the base groupoid are realized by paths in said fundamental groupoid. The main result is that, under mild conditions on the realizer category, the ensuing category of partitioned groupoidal assemblies models intensional (1-truncated) type theory without function extensionality. Moreover, when the underlying realizer category is "untyped", there exists an impredicative universe of 1-types (the modest fibrations). This is a groupoidal analogue of the traditional situation.</description>

      <title>Pseudo T-closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudo algebraically closed, pseudo real closed, and pseudo $p$-adically closed fields are examples of unstable fields that share many similarities, but have mostly been studied separately. In this text, we propose a unified framework for studying them: the class of pseudo $T$-closed fields, where $T$ is an enriched theory of fields. These fields verify a "local-global" principle for the existence of points on varieties with respect to models of $T$. This approach also enables a good description of some fields equipped with multiple $V$-topologies, particularly pseudo algebraically closed fields with a finite number of valuations. One important result is a (model theoretic) classification result for bounded pseudo $T$-closed fields, in particular we show that under specific hypotheses on $T$, these fields are NTP$_2$ of finite burden.</description>

      <title>Imaginaries in equicharacteristic zero henselian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an elimination of imaginaires results for (almost all) henselian valued fields of equicharacteristic zero. To do so, we consider a mix of sorts introduced in earlier works of the two authors and define a generalized version of the k-linear imaginaries. For a large class of value groups containing all subgroups of (\mathbb{R}^n) for some (n), we prove that the imaginaries of such a valued field can be elimininated in the field, the k-linear imaginaries and the imaginaries of the value group.</description>

      <title>Semitopology: a survey of a topological approach to distributed collaborative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09287v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce semitopologies, a generalisation of point-set topology that removes the restriction that intersections of open sets need necessarily be open. The intuition is that points are participants in some distributed system, and an open set is a collection of participants that can collaborate to update their local state by taking a distributed collaborative action; we call this an actionable coalition. What constitutes an actionable coalition depends on what actions we want to model. Intuitive examples include 'a group of people that is collectively strong enough to lift a rock', where the state update is very simply 'holding rock low' to 'holding rock high' and this update is common to all participants in the actionable coalition. Or, consider 'two people wishing to barter a can of juice for a bar of chocolate', in which case the coalition is any such pair and the state updates differ between participants to flip them between 'has/has no juice' and 'has/has no chocolate'. A characteristic of these systems is that state updates are local to the coalition, voluntary, may vary between participants, and are not assumed subject to permission or synchronisation by a central authority. Peer-to-peer computer networks, including filesharing and blockchain systems, provide motivating examples from computing. This paper presents a mathematics that is inspired by these considerations. It is interesting in and of itself, much like point-set topology is; and it provides a conceptual framework within which to understand a useful class of distributed systems.</description>

      <title>A 2-categorical analysis of context comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the equivalence between the two main categorical models for the type-theoretical operation of context comprehension, namely P. Dybjer's categories with families and B. Jacobs' comprehension categories, and generalise it to the non-discrete case. The classical equivalence can be summarised in the slogan: "terms as sections". By recognising "terms as coalgebras", we show how to use the structure-semantics adjunction to prove that a 2-category of comprehension categories is biequivalent to a 2-category of (non-discrete) categories with families. The biequivalence restricts to the classical one proved by Hofmann in the discrete case. It also provides a framework where to compare different morphisms of these structures that have appeared in the literature, varying on the degree of preservation of the relevant structure. We consider in particular morphisms defined by Claraimbault-Dybjer, Jacobs, Larrea, and Uemura.</description>

      <title>The elementary theory of the 2-category of small categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an elementary description of $2$-categories $\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)$ of internal categories, functors and natural transformations, where $\mathcal{E}$ is a category modelling Lawvere's elementary theory of the category of sets (ETCS). This extends Bourke's characterisation of $2$-categories $\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)$ where $\mathcal{E}$ has pullbacks to take account for the extra properties in ETCS, and Lawvere's characterisation of the (one dimensional) category of small categories to take account of the two-dimensional structure. Important two-dimensional concepts which we introduce include $2$-well-pointedness, full-subobject classifiers, and the categorified axiom of choice. Along the way, we show how generating families (resp. orthogonal factorisation systems) on $\mathcal{E}$ give rise to generating families (resp. orthogonal factorisation systems) on $\mathbf{Cat}\left(\mathcal{E}\right)_{1}$, results which we believe are of independent interest.</description>
