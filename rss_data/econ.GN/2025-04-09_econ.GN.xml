      <title>Beyond Credibility: Understanding the Mediators Between Electronic Word-of-Mouth and Purchase Intention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the mediating role of five variables in the relationship between eWOM credibility and purchase intention. Data were collected via an online survey of 359 Romanian participants and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results show that perceived product quality, emotional response to eWOM and perceived buying risk fully mediate this relationship, while brand trust and brand engagement do not. These findings suggest that effective eWOM communication should enhance quality perceptions, evoke positive emotions, and boost customer confidence by reducing perceived purchasing risks.</description>

      <title>The hybrid dilemma -- do hybrid technologies play a transitionary or stationary role in transitions processes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research unravels the stationary or transitionary dilemma of hybrid technologies in transitions processes. A system dynamics technology interaction framework is built and simulated based on Technological Innovation System and Lotka-Volterra to investigate the inter-technology relationship impacts and modes that hybrid technologies establish with incumbent and emerging technologies. This is conducted for the case of conventional, hybrid and battery electric vehicles under various scenarios . Results reveal that, by acting as an exploration-hybrid solution, hybrid technologies maintain a transitionary role by supporting mainly the technological development side of emerging technology. On the contrary, by acting as an exploitation-hybrid solution, they hardly (or never) sustain an inhibitive role against both the technological and market development sides of incumbent technology. While hybrid technologies may play a stationary role on the market development side in transitions processes, simulation results show that maintaining all inter-technology relationship modes as business-as-usual (i.e., baseline scenario) but instead simultaneously strengthening the various socio-technical dimensions of emerging technology and destabilising the various socio-technical dimensions of incumbent technology (i.e., sociotechnical scenario) is a more promising pathway in both short term (e.g., an accelerated uptake of emerging technology and decline of incumbent technology) and long term (e.g., highest emission reduction). Findings, additionally, reinforce the existence of both spillover and try-harder versions of 'sailing-ship effect', which are either seriously doubted in the literature or partially validated using raw bibliometric and patents data.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Human-AI Teaming: A Review and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at an unprecedented pace, with clear potential to enhance decision-making and productivity. Yet, the collaborative decision-making process between humans and AI remains underdeveloped, often falling short of its transformative possibilities. This paper explores the evolution of AI agents from passive tools to active collaborators in human-AI teams, emphasizing their ability to learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. This paradigm shifts challenges traditional team dynamics, requiring new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. Drawing on Team Situation Awareness (SA) theory, we identify two critical gaps in current human-AI teaming research: the difficulty of aligning AI agents with human values and objectives, and the underutilization of AI's capabilities as genuine team members. Addressing these gaps, we propose a structured research outlook centered on four key aspects of human-AI teaming: formulation, coordination, maintenance, and training. Our framework highlights the importance of shared mental models, trust-building, conflict resolution, and skill adaptation for effective teaming. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges posed by varying team compositions, goals, and complexities. This paper provides a foundational agenda for future research and practical design of sustainable, high-performing human-AI teams.</description>

      <title>Deploying Chatbots in Customer Service: Adoption Hurdles and Simple Remedies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, the use of chatbot technology in customer service continues to face adoption hurdles. This paper explores reasons for these adoption hurdles and tests several service design levers to increase chatbot uptake. We use incentivized online experiments to study chatbot uptake in a variety of scenarios. The results of these experiments are threefold. First, people respond positively to improvements in chatbot performance; however, the chatbot channel is utilized less frequently than expected-time minimization would predict. A key driver of this underutilization is the reluctance to engage with a gatekeeper process, i.e., a process with an imperfect initial service stage and possible transfer to a second, expert service stage -- a behavior we term "gatekeeper aversion". We show that gatekeeper aversion can be further amplified by a secondary hurdle, algorithm aversion. Second, chatbot uptake can be increased by providing customers with average waiting times in the chatbot channel, as well as by being more transparent about chatbot capabilities and limitations. Third, methodologically, we show that chatbot adoption can depend on experimental implementation. In particular, chatbot adoption decreases further as (i) stakes are increased, (ii) the human/algorithmic nature of the server is manipulated with more realism. Our results suggest that firms should continue to prioritize investments in chatbot technology. However, less expensive, process-related interventions can also be effective. These may include being more transparent about the types of queries that are (or are not) suitable for chatbots, emphasizing chatbot reliability and quick resolution times, as well as providing faster live agent access to customers who experienced chatbot failure.</description>

      <title>Cursed Job Market Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how cursedness, the tendency to neglect how other people's strategies depend on their private information, affects information transmission in Spence's job market signaling game. We characterize the Cursed Sequential Equilibrium and show that as players become more cursed, the worker obtains less education -- a costly signal that does not enhance productivity -- suggesting that cursedness improves the efficiency of information transmission. However, this efficiency improvement depends on the richness of the message space. Revisiting the job market signaling experiment by K\"ubler, M\"uller, and Normann (2008), we find supportive evidence for our theory.</description>

      <title>A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.</description>
