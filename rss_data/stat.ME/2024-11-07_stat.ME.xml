      <title>Extending Cluster-Weighted Factor Analyzers for multivariate prediction and high-dimensional interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster-weighted factor analyzers (CWFA) are a versatile class of mixture models designed to estimate the joint distribution of a random vector that includes a response variable along with a set of explanatory variables. They are particularly valuable in situations involving high dimensionality. This paper enhances CWFA models in two notable ways. First, it enables the prediction of multiple response variables while considering their potential interactions. Second, it identifies factors associated with disjoint groups of explanatory variables, thereby improving interpretability. This development leads to the introduction of the multivariate cluster-weighted disjoint factor analyzers (MCWDFA) model. An alternating expectation-conditional maximization algorithm is employed for parameter estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed through an extensive simulation study that examines various scenarios. The proposal is applied to crime data from the United States, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, with the aim of capturing potential latent heterogeneity within communities and identifying groups of socio-economic features that are similarly associated with factors predicting crime rates. Results provide valuable insights into the underlying structures influencing crime rates which may potentially be helpful for effective cluster-specific policymaking and social interventions.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian nonparametric approach to mediation and spillover effects with multiple mediators in cluster-randomized trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) with multiple unstructured mediators present significant methodological challenges for causal inference due to within-cluster correlation, interference among units, and the complexity introduced by multiple mediators. Existing causal mediation methods often fall short in simultaneously addressing these complexities, particularly in disentangling mediator-specific effects under interference that are central to studying complex mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose new causal estimands for spillover mediation effects that differentiate the roles of each individual's own mediator and the spillover effects resulting from interactions among individuals within the same cluster. We establish identification results for each estimand and, to flexibly model the complex data structures inherent in CRTs, we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric prior -- the Nested Dependent Dirichlet Process Mixture -- designed for flexibly capture the outcome and mediator surfaces at different levels. We conduct extensive simulations across various scenarios to evaluate the frequentist performance of our methods, compare them with a Bayesian parametric counterpart and illustrate our new methods in an analysis of a completed CRT.</description>

      <title>Exact Designs for OofA Experiments Under a Transition-Effect Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries, sometimes the order of adding a set of components has an impact on the final product. These are instances of the order-of-addition (OofA) problem, which aims to find the optimal sequence of the components. Extensive research on this topic has been conducted, but almost all designs are found by optimizing the $D-$optimality criterion. However, when prediction of the response is important, there is still a need for $I-$optimal designs. A new model for OofA experiments is presented that uses transition effects to model the effect of order on the response, and the model is extended to cover cases where block-wise constraints are placed on the order of addition. Several algorithms are used to find both $D-$ and $I-$efficient designs under this new model for many run sizes and for large numbers of components. Finally, two examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and model at identifying the optimal order of addition, even under block-wise constraints.</description>

      <title>Monotone Missing Data: A Blessing and a Curse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monotone missingness is commonly encountered in practice where a missing measurement compels another measurement to be missing. In graphical missing data models, monotonicity has implications for the identifiability of the full law, i.e., the joint distribution of actual variables and response indicators. In the general nonmonotone case, the full law is known to be nonparametrically identifiable if and only if neither colluders nor self-censoring edges are present in the graph. We show that monotonicity may enable the identification of the full law despite colluders and prevent the identification under mediated (pathwise) self-censoring. The results emphasize the importance of proper treatment of monotone missingness in the analysis of incomplete data.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian joint modal estimation for exploratory item factor analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a scalable Bayesian estimation algorithm for sparse estimation in exploratory item factor analysis based on a classical Bayesian estimation method, namely Bayesian joint modal estimation (BJME). BJME estimates the model parameters and factor scores that maximize the complete-data joint posterior density. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm has high computational efficiency and accuracy in variable selection over latent factors and the recovery of the model parameters. Moreover, we conducted a real data analysis using large-scale data from a psychological assessment that targeted the Big Five personality traits. This result indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves computationally efficient parameter estimation and extracts the interpretable factor loading structure.</description>

      <title>Federated mixed effects logistic regression based on one-time shared summary statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upholding data privacy especially in medical research has become tantamount to facing difficulties in accessing individual-level patient data. Estimating mixed effects binary logistic regression models involving data from multiple data providers like hospitals thus becomes more challenging. Federated learning has emerged as an option to preserve the privacy of individual observations while still estimating a global model that can be interpreted on the individual level, but it usually involves iterative communication between the data providers and the data analyst. In this paper, we present a strategy to estimate a mixed effects binary logistic regression model that requires data providers to share summary statistics only once. It involves generating pseudo-data whose summary statistics match those of the actual data and using these into the model estimation process instead of the actual unavailable data. Our strategy is able to include multiple predictors which can be a combination of continuous and categorical variables. Through simulation, we show that our approach estimates the true model at least as good as the one which requires the pooled individual observations. An illustrative example using real data is provided. Unlike typical federated learning algorithms, our approach eliminates infrastructure requirements and security issues while being communication efficient and while accounting for heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Bipartite Networks in Anime Series: Textual Analysis, Topic Clustering, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article analyzes a specific bipartite network that shows the relationships between users and anime, examining how the descriptions of anime influence the formation of user communities. In particular, we introduce a new variable that quantifies the frequency with which words from a description appear in specific word clusters. These clusters are generated from a bigram analysis derived from all descriptions in the database. This approach fully characterizes the dynamics of these communities and shows how textual content affect the cohesion and structure of the social network among anime enthusiasts. Our findings suggest that there may be significant implications for the design of recommendation systems and the enhancement of user experience on anime platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies asymptotic properties of estimators of multidimensional stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motions from high-frequency discrete data. Consistency and central limit properties of a class of estimators of the diffusion parameter and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator of the drift parameter based on a discretized likelihood function have been established in a suitable scaling regime involving the time-gap between the observations and the overall time span. Our framework is more general than that typically considered in the literature and, thus, has the potential to be applicable to a wider range of stochastic models.</description>

      <title>Constrained Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization through Optimistic Constraints Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization has been widely adopted in scientific experiment design, including drug discovery and hyperparameter optimization. In practice, regulatory or safety concerns often impose additional thresholds on certain attributes of the experimental outcomes. Previous work has primarily focused on constrained single-objective optimization tasks or active search under constraints. We propose CMOBO, a sample-efficient constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm that balances learning of the feasible region (defined on multiple unknowns) with multi-objective optimization within the feasible region in a principled manner. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical evidence, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach on various synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Cell Type Deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating data from different platforms, such as bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, is crucial for improving the accuracy and interpretability of complex biological analyses like cell type deconvolution. However, this task is complicated by measurement and biological heterogeneity between target and reference datasets. For the problem of cell type deconvolution, existing methods often neglect the correlation and uncertainty in cell type proportion estimates, possibly leading to an additional concern of false positives in downstream comparisons across multiple individuals. We introduce MEAD, a comprehensive statistical framework that not only estimates cell type proportions but also provides asymptotically valid statistical inference on the estimates. One of our key contributions is the identifiability result, which rigorously establishes the conditions under which cell type proportions are identifiable despite arbitrary heterogeneity of measurement biases between platforms. MEAD also supports the comparison of cell type proportions across individuals after deconvolution, accounting for gene-gene correlations and biological variability. Through simulations and real-data analysis, MEAD demonstrates superior reliability for inferring cell type compositions in complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>Profile Monitoring via Eigenvector Perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Statistical Process Control, control charts are often used to detect undesirable behavior of sequentially observed quality characteristics. Designing a control chart with desirably low False Alarm Rate (FAR) and detection delay ($ARL_1$) is an important challenge especially when the sampling rate is high and the control chart has an In-Control Average Run Length, called $ARL_0$, of 200 or more, as commonly found in practice. Unfortunately, arbitrary reduction of the FAR typically increases the $ARL_1$. Motivated by eigenvector perturbation theory, we propose the Eigenvector Perturbation Control Chart for computationally fast nonparametric profile monitoring. Our simulation studies show that it outperforms the competition and achieves both $ARL_1 \approx 1$ and $ARL_0 &gt; 10^6$.</description>

Abstract: The aim of change-point detection is to identify behavioral shifts within time series data. This article focuses on scenarios where the data is derived from an inhomogeneous Poisson process or a marked Poisson process. We present a methodology for detecting multiple offline change-points using a minimum contrast estimator. Specifically, we address how to manage the continuous nature of the process given the available discrete observations. Additionally, we select the appropriate number of changes via a cross-validation procedure which is particularly effective given the characteristics of the Poisson process. Lastly, we show how to use this methodology to self-exciting processes with changes in the intensity. Through experiments, with both simulated and real datasets, we showcase the advantages of the proposed method, which has been implemented in the R package \texttt{CptPointProcess}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have utilized the non-conjugate VB method for the problem of the sparse Poisson regression model. To provide an approximated conjugacy in the model, the likelihood is approximated by a quadratic function, which provides the conjugacy of the approximation component with the Gaussian prior to the regression coefficient. Three sparsity-enforcing priors are used for this problem. The proposed models are compared with each other and two frequentist sparse Poisson methods (LASSO and SCAD) to evaluate the estimation, prediction and the sparsing performance of the proposed methods. Throughout a simulated data example, the accuracy of the VB methods is computed compared to the corresponding benchmark MCMC methods. It can be observed that the proposed VB methods have provided a good approximation to the posterior distribution of the parameters, while the VB methods are much faster than the MCMC ones. Using several benchmark count response data sets, the prediction performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the general performance of the difference-in-means estimator in an equally-allocated two-arm randomized experiment under common experimental endpoints such as continuous (regression), incidence, proportion, count and uncensored survival. We consider two sources of randomness: the subject-specific assignments and the contribution of unobserved subject-specific measurements. We then examine mean squared error (MSE) performance under a new, more realistic "simultaneous tail criterion". We prove that the pairwise matching design of Greevy et al. (2004) performs best asymptotically under this criterion when compared to other blocking designs. We also prove that the optimal design must be less random than complete randomization and more random than any deterministic, optimized allocation. Theoretical results are supported by simulations in all five response types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel periodogram-like function called expectile periodograms, for detecting and estimating hidden periodicities in time series. The expectile periodograms are constructed from trigonometric expectile regression, in which a specially designed objective function is used to substitute the squared $l_2$ norm that leads to the ordinary periodograms.
  Analogous to quantile periodograms, the expectile periodograms provide a broader view of the time series than the ordinary periodograms by examining different expectile levels, while achieving higher computational efficiency. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the expectile periodograms in the presence of hidden periodicities. Finally, we leverage the inherent two-dimensional characteristics of the expectile periodograms and train a deep-learning (DL) model to classify the earthquake waveform data. Remarkably, our approach achieves higher classification testing accuracy when juxtaposed with alternative periodogram-based methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making informed decisions in medicine, yet they often lack generalizability to the patient populations in clinical practice. Observational studies, on the other hand, cover a broader patient population but are prone to various biases. Thus, before using an observational study for decision-making, it is crucial to benchmark its treatment effect estimates against those derived from a randomized trial. We propose a novel strategy to benchmark observational studies beyond the average treatment effect. First, we design a statistical test for the null hypothesis that the treatment effects estimated from the two studies, conditioned on a set of relevant features, differ up to some tolerance. We then estimate an asymptotically valid lower bound on the maximum bias strength for any subgroup in the observational study. Finally, we validate our benchmarking strategy in a real-world setting and show that it leads to conclusions that align with established medical knowledge.</description>

Abstract: We consider the performance of the difference-in-means estimator in a two-arm randomized experiment under common experimental endpoints such as continuous (regression), incidence, proportion and survival. We examine performance under both equal and unequal allocation to treatment groups and we consider both the Neyman randomization model and the population model. We show that in the Neyman model, where the only source of randomness is the treatment manipulation, there is no free lunch: complete randomization is minimax for the estimator's mean squared error. In the population model, where each subject experiences response noise with zero mean, the optimal design is the deterministic perfect-balance allocation. However, this allocation is generally NP-hard to compute and moreover, depends on unknown response parameters. When considering the tail criterion of Kapelner et al. (2021), we show the optimal design is less random than complete randomization and more random than the deterministic perfect-balance allocation. We prove that Fisher's blocking design provides the asymptotically optimal degree of experimental randomness. Theoretical results are supported by simulations in all considered experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Series ridge regression for spatial data on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>

Abstract: This paper develops a general asymptotic theory of series estimators for spatial data collected at irregularly spaced locations within a sampling region $R_n \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We employ a stochastic sampling design that can flexibly generate irregularly spaced sampling sites, encompassing both pure increasing and mixed increasing domain frameworks. Specifically, we focus on a spatial trend regression model and a nonparametric regression model with spatially dependent covariates. For these models, we investigate $L^2$-penalized series estimation of the trend and regression functions. We establish uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and multivariate central limit theorems for general series estimators as main results. Additionally, we show that spline and wavelet series estimators achieve optimal uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and propose methods for constructing confidence intervals for these estimators. Finally, we demonstrate that our dependence structure conditions on the underlying spatial processes include a broad class of random fields, including L\'evy-driven continuous autoregressive and moving average random fields.</description>

      <title>Centrality in Collaboration: A Novel Algorithm for Social Partitioning Gradients in Community Detection for Multiple Oncology Clinical Trial Enrollments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patients at a comprehensive cancer center who do not achieve cure or remission following standard treatments often become candidates for clinical trials. Patients who participate in a clinical trial may be suitable for other studies. A key factor influencing patient enrollment in subsequent clinical trials is the structured collaboration between oncologists and most responsible physicians. Possible identification of these collaboration networks can be achieved through the analysis of patient movements between clinical trial intervention types with social network analysis and community detection algorithms. In the detection of oncologist working groups, the present study evaluates three community detection algorithms: Girvan-Newman, Louvain and an algorithm developed by the author. Girvan-Newman identifies each intervention as their own community, while Louvain groups interventions in a manner that is difficult to interpret. In contrast, the author's algorithm groups interventions in a way that is both intuitive and informative, with a gradient evident in social partitioning that is particularly useful for epidemiological research. This lays the groundwork for future subgroup analysis of clustered interventions.</description>
