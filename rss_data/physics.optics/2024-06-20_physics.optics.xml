      <title>Self-Hybridized Exciton-Polariton Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic semiconductors are attractive for next-generation photovoltaics (PVs) with lower cost, lighter weight, and lower material consumption than conventional technologies. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenide materials like WS2 are especially interesting due to exceptionally strong light-matter interaction. Photocurrent generation in excitonic PVs relies on exciton diffusion to heterointerfaces. However, efficiencies of excitonic PVs are often limited by short exciton diffusion lengths. Here we report that the strong coupling of excitons to cavity photons in a WS2 absorber layer can enhance the external quantum efficiency by a factor of &gt;10, internal quantum efficiency by a factor of ~3, and power conversion efficiency of excitonic PVs by an order of magnitude. The resulting hybrid states, exciton-polaritons, enhance the resonant absorption and exciton transport while the use of the WS2 layer as its own optical cavity enables broadband absorption. Thickness dependent device characterization reveals anomalous internal quantum efficiency and fill factor behavior that are attributed to novel exciton-polariton transport. Exciton-polariton enhanced transport occurs for both resonant and off-resonant excitation, emphasizing the value and practicality of the self-hybridized device structure. Our work presents a route towards excitonic PVs with broadband absorption and improved exciton transport without strict requirements of donor/acceptor structure of other excitonic PVs.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable vacuum-gap Fabry-P\'erot cavities operated in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a vacuum-gap ultrastable optical reference cavity that does not require a vacuum enclosure. Our simple method of optical contact bonding in a vacuum environment allows for cavity operation in air while maintaining vacuum between the cavity mirrors. Vacuum is maintained long term, with no observed degradation in cavity stability for over 1 year after bonding. For a 1550 nm laser stabilized to a 9.7 mL in-vacuum bonded cavity, the measured Allan deviation is $2.4\times 10^{-14}$ at 1 s and its phase noise is thermal-noise-limited from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, reaching about -105 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset frequency. This represents the highest stability of any oscillator operated without a vacuum enclosure. Furthermore, we demonstrate a 0.5 mL in-vacuum bonded cavity created using microfabricated mirrors and cavity dicing, with phase noise reaching -95 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset frequency. By relieving the need for high-vacuum enclosures, we greatly enhance the portability and utility of low noise, compact cavity-stabilized lasers, with applications ranging from environmental sensing to mobile optical clocks to ultralow noise microwave generation.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution 3D tomography of vector near-fields in dielectric resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-dielectric optical resonators, exhibiting exotic near-field distributions upon excitations, have emerged as low-loss, versatile and highly adaptable components in nanophotonic structures for manipulating electromagnetic waves and enhancing light-matter interactions. However, achieving experimental full three-dimensional characterization of near-fields within dielectric materials poses significant challenges. Here, we develop a novel technique using high-order sideband generation to image near-field wave patterns inside dielectric optical resonators. By exploiting the phase-sensitivity of various harmonic orders that enables the detection of near-field distributions at distinct depths, we realize three-dimensional tomographic and super-resolution near-field imaging inside a micrometer-thick silicon anapole resonator. Furthermore, our method offers high-contrast polarization sensitivity and phase-resolving capability, providing comprehensive vectorial near-field information. Our approach can potentially be applied to diverse dielectric metamaterials, and becomes a valuable tool for comprehensive characterization of near-field wave phenomena within dielectric materials.</description>

      <title>A programmable wafer-scale chiroptical heterostructure of twisted aligned carbon nanotubes and phase change materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to design and dynamically control chiroptical responses in solid-state matter at wafer scale enables new opportunities in various areas. Here we present a full stack of computer-aided designs and experimental implementations of a dynamically programmable, unified, scalable chiroptical heterostructure containing twisted aligned one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and non-volatile phase change materials (PCMs). We develop a software infrastructure based on high-performance machine learning frameworks, including differentiable programming and derivative-free optimization, to efficiently optimize the tunability of both excitonic reciprocal and linear-anisotropy-induced nonreciprocal circular dichroism (CD) responses. We experimentally implement designed heterostructures with wafer-scale self-assembled aligned CNTs and deposited PCMs. We dynamically program reciprocal and nonreciprocal CD responses by inducing phase transitions of PCMs, and nonreciprocal responses display polarity reversal of CD upon sample flipping in broadband spectral ranges. All experimental results agree with simulations. Further, we demonstrate that the vertical dimension of heterostructure is scalable with the number of stacking layers and aligned CNTs play dual roles - the layer to produce CD responses and the Joule heating electrode to electrically program PCMs. This heterostructure platform is versatile and expandable to a library of 1D nanomaterials and electro-optic materials for exploring novel chiral phenomena and photonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>An alkali-referenced vector spectrum analyzer for visible-light integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics has reformed our information society by offering on-chip optical signal synthesis, processing and detection with reduced size, weight and power consumption. As such, it has been successfully established in the near-infrared (NIR) telecommunication bands. With the soaring demand in miniaturized systems for biosensing, quantum information and transportable atomic clocks, extensive endeavors have been stacked on translating integrated photonics into the visible spectrum, i.e. visible-light integrated photonics. Various innovative visible-light integrated devices have been demonstrated, such as lasers, frequency combs, and atom traps, highlighting the capacity and prospect to create chip-based optical atomic clocks that can make timing and frequency metrology ubiquitous. A pillar to the development of visible-light integrated photonics is characterization techniques featuring high frequency resolution and wide spectral coverage, which however remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate a vector spectrum analyzer (VSA) for visible-light integrated photonics, offering spectral bandwidth from 766 to 795 nm and frequency resolution of 415 kHz. The VSA is rooted on a widely chirping, high-power, narrow-linewidth, mode-hop-free laser around 780 nm, which is frequency-doubled from the near-infrared via an efficient, broadband CPLN waveguide. The VSA is further referenced to hyperfine structures of rubidium and potassium atoms, enabling 8.1 MHz frequency accuracy. We apply our VSA to showcase the characterization of loss, dispersion and phase response of passive integrated devices, as well as densely spaced spectra of mode-locked lasers. Combining operation in the NIR and visible spectra, our VSA allows characterization bandwidth exceeding an octave and can be an invaluable diagnostic tool for spectroscopy, nonlinear optical processing, imaging and quantum interfaces to atomic devices.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary Quality Factors in Dual-Band Polarization-Insensitive QuasiBound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a novel "dimerized" dielectric metasurface featuring dual-mode resonances governed by symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs). The metasurface design offers advantages such as insensitivity to incident light polarization and exceptionally high quality factors exceeding 10$^5$ for low and moderate structural deviations from the monoatomic array. By introducing mastered perturbations in the metasurface via the Brillouin zone folding method, without reducing symmetry, we explore the behavior of symmetry-protected BIC states and their polarization-independent responses. Through numerical simulations and analysis, we demonstrate the superiority of Q factors for specific BIC-based resonances, leading to precise control over interaction behaviors and light engineering in both near and far fields. Our findings contribute to the understanding of BIC resonance interactions and offer insights into the design of high-performance sensing applications and meta-devices with enhanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Assessing the 3D resolution of refocused correlation plenoptic images using a general-purpose image quality estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation plenoptic imaging (CPI) is emerging as a promising approach to light-field imaging (LFI), a technique enabling simultaneous measurement of light intensity distribution and propagation direction from a scene. LFI allows single-shot 3D sampling, offering fast 3D reconstruction for a wide range of applications. However, the array of micro-lenses typically used in LFI to obtain 3D information limits image resolution, which rapidly declines with enhanced volumetric reconstruction capabilities. CPI addresses this limitation by decoupling light-field information measurement using two photodetectors with spatial resolution, eliminating the need for micro-lenses. 3D information is encoded in a four-dimensional correlation function, which is decoded in post-processing to reconstruct images without the resolution loss seen in conventional LFI. This paper evaluates the tomographic performance of CPI, demonstrating that the refocusing reconstruction method provides axial sectioning capabilities comparable to conventional imaging systems. A general-purpose analytical approach based on image fidelity is proposed to quantitatively study axial and lateral resolution. This analysis fully characterizes the volumetric resolution of any CPI architecture, offering a comprehensive evaluation of its imaging performance.</description>

      <title>Farey tree locking of terahertz semiconductor laser frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency combs show various applications in molecular fingerprinting, imaging, communications, and so on. In the terahertz frequency range, semiconductor-based quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are ideal platforms for realizing the frequency comb operation. Although self-started frequency comb operation can be obtained in free-running terahertz QCLs due to the four-wave mixing locking effects, resonant/off-resonant microwave injection, phase locking, and femtosecond laser based locking techniques have been widely used to broaden and stabilize terahertz QCL combs. These active locking methods indeed show significant effects on the frequency stabilization of terahertz QCL combs, but they simultaneously have drawbacks, such as introducing large phase noise and requiring complex optical coupling and/or electrical circuits. Here, we demonstrate Farey tree locking of terahertz QCL frequency combs under microwave injection. The frequency competition between the Farey fraction frequency and the cavity round-trip frequency results in the frequency locking of terahertz QCL combs, and the Farey fraction frequencies can be accurately anticipated based on the downward trend of the Farey tree hierarchy. Furthermore, dual-comb experimental results show that the phase noise of the dual-comb spectral lines is significantly reduced by employing the Farey tree locking method. These results pave the way to deploying compact and low phase noise terahertz frequency comb sources.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diffractive Focusing of Quantum Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the familiar analogy between the optical paraxial wave equation and the Schr\"odinger equation, we derive the optimal, real-valued wave function for focusing in one and two space dimensions without the use of any phase component. We compare and contrast the focusing parameters of the optimal waves with those of other diffractive focusing approaches, such as Fresnel zones. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate these focusing properties on optical beams using both reflective and transmissive liquid crystal devices. Our results provide an alternative direction for focusing waves where phase elements are challenging to implement, such as for X-rays, THz radiation, and electron beams.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin and orbital angular momenta in rotating-wave structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within monochromatic optical fields, we demonstrate the rotating-wave structured light with wave vortex carrying an intrinsic transverse orbital angular momentum orthogonal to the propagation direction of light. Remarkably, we find that such a rotating-wave structured light reveals highly nontrivial features of transverse spin and orbital angular momentum densities. The normalized total angular momentum density is conserved universally, suggesting a mutual conversion of the intrinsic transverse spin and orbital angular momentum in free space. Despite such mutual conversion at local level, the integral intrinsic orbital angular momentum can be well defined with the topological charge of the vortex per photon. Moreover, the orientation of transverse spin density is governed by the direction of the Poynting momentum density, manifesting a spin-momentum-locking effect in free space.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency-resolved Hanbury Brown-Twiss Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect holds a pivotal place in intensity interferometry and gave a seminal contribution to the development of quantum optics. To observe such an effect, both good spectral and timing resolutions are necessary. Most often, the HBT effect is observed for a single frequency at a time, due to limitations in dealing with multifrequencies simultaneously, halting and limiting some applications. Here, we report a fast and data-driven spectrometer built with a one-dimensional array of single-photon-sensitive avalanche diodes. We report observing the HBT effect for multifrequencies at the same time. Specifically, we observed the HBT for up to 5 lines of the Ne spectrum, but this can be improved even further. Our work represents a major step to make spectral binning and multifrequencies HBT more widely available. The technology we present can benefit both classical and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Near-Field Intensity Distribution in Subwavelength Gratings through Cylindrical Wave Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation into the scattering of plane waves by a periodic array of parallel cylinders utilizes the method of cylindrical wave decomposition, thereby reducing the problem complexity to a series of linear algebraic equations. This methodology proves particularly efficacious when the diameter of cylinders is significantly less than the wavelength of incident wave, resulting in a rapid diminution of the solution coefficients as a function of azimuth numbers. Such a reductionist approach facilitates the computation of scattered radiation intensity in near field. Subsequent cross-validation with numerical results corroborates the theoretical findings, showcasing a qualitative concordance between the two. This study underscores the efficacy of cylindrical wave decomposition in simplifying and accurately modeling wave scattering phenomena in structured media.</description>

      <title>Pixel-scale NIR-VIS Spectral Routers Based on 2D Mie-type Metagratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The out-of-band energy loss caused by in-built color filters significantly degrades the signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic range of conventional image sensors, which has restricted the attempt to develop ultrahigh-density imaging devices by merely shrinking the pixel size. This issue will be more serious for security cameras which need to collect visible (VIS) light and near-infrared (NIR) photons as well. The existing solutions mostly explore complex photonic nanostructures, which are often too complicated for production. In this work, we demonstrate a pixel-scale spectral router utilizing two-dimensional (2D) Si3N4 Mie scattering metagratings that can spatially divide NIR (850 nm) and VIS (400-700 nm) light to different pixels at high efficiencies. It has a minimum feature size larger than 360 nm, highly promising for massive production. Compared with the traditional filter design, our router can gain about 42% and 30% signal enhancement for NIR and VIS band, respectively. We show that it also has good polarization insensitivity and incident angle tolerance. The NIR-VIS simultaneous imaging is inspected without any complex reconstruction algorithm. Mode analysis indicates that the multipolar scattering of our Mie-type metagratings provides the necessary degrees of freedom to spatially optimize the routing functions for broadband photons.</description>

      <title>A microwave photonic prototype for concurrent radar detection and spectrum sensing over an 8 to 40 GHz bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a microwave photonic prototype for concurrent radar detection and spectrum sensing is proposed, designed, built, and investigated. A direct digital synthesizer and an analog electronic circuit are integrated to generate an intermediate frequency (IF) linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) signal with a tunable center frequency from 2.5 to 9.5 GHz and an instantaneous bandwidth of 1 GHz. The IF LFM signal is converted to the optical domain via an intensity modulator and then filtered by a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) to generate only two 2nd-order optical LFM sidebands. In radar detection, the two optical LFM sidebands beat with each other to generate a frequency-and-bandwidth-quadrupled LFM signal, which is used for ranging, radial velocity measurement, and imaging. By changing the center frequency of the IF LFM signal, the radar function can be operated within 8 to 40 GHz. In spectrum sensing, one 2nd-order optical LFM sideband is selected by another FBG, which then works in conjunction with the stimulated Brillouin scattering gain spectrum to map the frequency of the signal under test to time with an instantaneous measurement bandwidth of 2 GHz. By using a frequency shift module to adjust the pump frequency, the frequency measurement range can be adjusted from 0 to 40 GHz. The prototype is comprehensively studied and tested, which is capable of achieving a range resolution of 3.75 cm, a range error of less than $\pm$ 2 cm, a radial velocity error within $\pm$ 1 cm/s, delivering clear imaging of multiple small targets, and maintaining a frequency measurement error of less than $\pm$ 7 MHz and a frequency resolution of better than 20 MHz.</description>

      <title>Beam shaping by nonlinear moir\'e metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the interplay of momentum transfer and nonlinear optical processes through moir\'e phenomena. Momentum transfer plays a crucial role in the interaction between photons and matter. Here, we study stacked metasurfaces with tailored dispersion and rotated against each other with varying twisted angles. The stacking introduces interlayer interactions, which can be controlled by the relative angle between metasurfaces, significantly enriching the resulting response compared to the single layer counterpart. By focusing on second-harmonic generation (SHG) from these twisted metasurfaces, we delve into the realm of nonlinear moir\'e photonics. Through experimental observations, we unveil the emergence of intricate far-field SHG radiation patterns, showing their effective tuning by varying the twisted angles. These findings offer a fresh perspective to explore nonlinear wavefront shaping through moir\'e phenomena, opening new avenues for nonlinear information processing, optical steering, and nonlinear optical switching.</description>

      <title>Understanding building blocks of photonic logic gates: Reversible, read-write-erase cycling using photoswitchable beads in micropatterned arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using surface-templated electrophoretic deposition, we have created arrays of polymer beads (photonic units) incorporating photo-switchable DAE molecules, which can be reversibly and individually switched between high and low emission states by direct photo-excitation, without any energy or electron transfer processes within the molecular system. The micropatterned array of these photonic units is spectroscopically characterized in detail and optimized with respect to both signal contrast and cross-talk. The optimum optical parameters including laser intensity, wavelength and duration of irradiation are elucidated and ideal conditions for creating reversible on/off cycles in a micropatterned array are determined. 500 such cycles are demonstrated with no obvious on/off contrast attenuation. The ability to process binary information is demonstrated by selectively writing information to the given photonic unit, reading the resultant emissive signal pattern and finally erasing the information again, which in turn demonstrates the possibility of continuous recording. This basic study paves the way for building complex circuits using spatially well-arranged photonic units.</description>

      <title>Stress-Dependent Optical Extinction in LPCVD Silicon Nitride Measured by Nanomechanical Photothermal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding optical absorption in silicon nitride is crucial for cutting-edge technologies like photonic integrated circuits, nanomechanical photothermal infrared sensing and spectroscopy, and cavity optomechanics. Yet, the origin of its strong dependence on film deposition and fabrication process is not fully understood. This Letter leverages nanomechanical photothermal sensing to investigate optical extinction $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ at 632.8 nm wavelength in LPCVD SiN strings across a wide range of deposition-related tensile stresses ($200-850$ MPa). Measurements reveal a reduction in $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ from 10$^3$ to 10$^1$ ppm with increasing stress, correlated to variations in Si/N content ratio. Within the band-fluctuations framework, this trend indicates an increase of the energy bandgap with the stress, ultimately reducing absorption. Overall, this study showcases the power and simplicity of nanomechanical photothermal sensing for low absorption measurements, offering a sensitive, scattering-free platform for material analysis in nanophotonics and nanomechanics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast TACOS -- Terahertz-Assisted Chiro-Optical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bring together the advantages of terahertz (THz) and optical spectroscopies to introduce TACOS (Terahertz-Assisted Chiro-Optical Spectroscopy), a novel approach for ultrafast and highly efficient imaging of molecular chirality and control over chiral electronic dynamics. We show how, using a THz pulse, we can induce a transient electronic orientation in a medium of randomly oriented chiral molecules that breaks the isotropy of the molecular sample. This symmetry breaking twists the nonlinear response of the medium to an ultrashort linearly polarised optical pulse in a highly enantiosensitive manner. As a result, the medium emits elliptically polarised light at new optical frequencies that records the molecular handedness via purely electric-dipole interactions. The long wavelength and period of the THz pulse enable both spatial coherence across the sample and a substantial degree of electronic orientation over the duration of the ultrashort optical pulse. TACOS does not require optical carrier-envelope phase stability or working in vacuum, and it creates exciting avenues for ultrafast and highly efficient chiral sensing and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Foundry compatible, efficient wafer-scale manufacturing of ultra-low loss, high-density Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have shown low linear loss, negligible nonlinear loss, and high power handling over traditional silicon photonics. To achieve high-density photonic integration and high effective nonlinearity through tight optical confinement, thick stoichiometric Si$_3$N$_4$ films are indispensable. However, when using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) to achieve high optical material transparency, Si$_3$N$_4$ films exhibit large tensile stress on the order of GPa. Methods for crack prevention are therefore essential. The photonic Damascene process has addressed this issue, attaining record low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs, but it lacks control of the waveguide height. Conversely, precise waveguide dimension and ultra-low loss have been achieved with subtractive processing, but this method is not compatible with mass production due to the use of electron beam lithography. To date, an outstanding challenge is to attain both lithographic precision and ultra-low loss in high confinement Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs that are compatible with large-scale foundry manufacturing. Here, we present a single-step deposited, DUV-based subtractive method for producing wafer-scale ultra-low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs that harmonize these necessities. By employing deep etching of densely distributed, interconnected trenches into the substrate, we effectively mitigate the tensile stress in the Si$_3$N$_4$ layer, enabling direct deposition of thick films without cracking and substantially prolonged storage duration. Lastly, we identify ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced damage that can be remedied through rapid thermal annealing. Collectively, we develop ultra-low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators and 0.5 m-long spiral waveguides with losses down to 1.4 dB/m at 1550 nm with high production yield.</description>

      <title>Photonic and phononic modes in acoustoplasmonic toroidal nanopropellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-conventional resonances, both acoustic and photonic, are found in metallic particles with a toroidal nanopropeller geometry that is generated by sweeping a three-lobed 2D-shape along a spiral with twisting angle, ${\alpha}$. For both optical and acoustic cases, spectral location of resonances experiences a red-shift as a function of ${\alpha}$. We demonstrate that the optical case can be understood as a natural evolution of resonances as the spiral length of the toroidal nanopropeller increases with ${\alpha}$, implying a huge helicity dependent absorption cross section. In the case of acoustic response, two red-shifting breathing modes are identified. Additionally, even small ${\alpha}$ allows the appearance of new low-frequency resonances, whose spectral dispersion depends on a competition between length of the generative spiral and the pitch of the toroidal nanopropeller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characterization of Ring Laser Gyroscopes (RLGs) was performed at INFN-Pisa, and optimization is ongoing for a kind of very high sensitivity and accuracy rotation measurement device. Data quality is monitored through fringe contrast, such quantity is factorized, as it depends on single light beam values and their alignment, and on the polarization of the beams at their interference outside the cavity. Models of the alignment and polarization contributions to contrast have been implemented. In particular, the GP2 prototype at INFN-Pisa was characterized as for non-planarity, alignment, and polarization of the interfering beams. Beams interference was optimized by obtaining linearly polarized beams out of the cavity. Advantage with respect to elliptically polarized interfering beams is shown.</description>

      <title>An efficient singlet-triplet spin qubit to fiber interface assisted by a photonic crystal cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel optical interface between a singlet-triplet spin qubit and a photonic qubit which would offer new prospects for future quantum communication applications. The interface is based on a 220 nm thick GaAs/Al-GaAs heterostructure membrane and features a gate-defined singlet-triplet qubit, a gate-defined optically active quantum dot, a photonic crystal cavity and a bot-tom gold reflector. All essential components can be lithographically defined and deterministically fabricated, which greatly increases the scalability of on-chip in-tegration. According to our FDTD simulations, the interface provides an overall coupling efficiency of 28.7% into a free space Gaussian beam, assuming an SiO2 interlayer filling the space between the reflector and the membrane. The performance can be further increased to 48.5% by undercutting this SiO2 interlayer below the photonic crystal.</description>

      <title>External Cavity 637-nm Laser with Increased RSOA-to-PIC Alignment Tolerance and a Filtered Sagnac-Loop Reflector with Single Output Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of a 637-nm wavelength, photonic-integrated-circuit-based external cavity laser (PIC-based ECL) aimed at quantum technology applications is presented together with first experimental results. The PIC is designed to provide relaxed alignment tolerance for coupling to a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) gain chip. This is achieved by using a multi-mode edge coupler (MMEC) in place of the usually employed single-mode coupling schemes. A 1-dB-penalty misalignment tolerance of up to +/- 2.4 um can be achieved in the plane of the chip, creating a path towards reliable flip-chip integration at short wavelengths. The power coupled to the PIC is fed to a Sagnac-loop reflector, filtered by a pair of ring resonators operated in Vernier configuration for providing the required frequency selective optical feedback. The ring resonators are designed to have different loaded Q-factors and they are asymmetrically coupled to bus and drop waveguides with suitably engineered directional couplers to provide single output waveguide emission. Moreover, requirements for high output power and narrow linewidths are balanced. Finally, preliminary measurements strongly suggest lasing in the fabricated devices, with further performance optimization being currently carried out.</description>

Abstract: We present a silicon-nitride-based optical phased array with built-in focusing and steering capability, that operates at 522 nm and is aimed at complementing a micro-electrode array for joint electrical and optical probing of retinal tissue. It achieves subcellular resolution with a beam diameter of 1.4 um at a focal point located above the chip. Targeted cellular excitation can be achieved by steering the beam through a combination of wavelength tuning and simplified thermo-optical phase shifters with a single electrical input for each of transverse beam steering and selection of the focal plane.</description>

      <title>Silicon Nitride C-Band Grating Coupler with Reduced Waveguide Back-Reflection Using Adaptively Corrected Elliptical Grates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results for a fully etched C-band grating coupler with reduced back reflection fabricated in an 800 nm silicon nitride platform. Back-reflections are reduced by symmetrically interrupting the first few grates around the center axis of the propagating light. The span of the etched grates is gradually increased until they cover the full width. By interrupting the grates, light is reflected back obliquely, which leads to the excitation of higher-order modes that are scattered out of the structure. While this approach has been previously shown in silicon, it comes with a significant penalty in coupling efficiency of around 2.4 dB of extra loss in the layer stack investigated here. In this work, we present the design and measurement results of a grating coupler in which waveguide-to-waveguide back-reflections are suppressed by ~10 dB with this technique, while at the same time mitigating excess insertion losses by reshaping the grates as ellipses of varying eccentricity. This helps to compensate the phase front error induced by the interruption of the grates. This correction does not affect the level by which the back-reflection is suppressed, but reduces the insertion loss penalty from 2.4 dB to 1 dB.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic methane detection assisted by a gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic spectroscopys (PAS)-based methane (CH4) detectors have garnered significant attention with various developed systems using near-infrared (NIR) laser sources, which requires high-energy and narrow-linewidth laser sources to achieve high-sensitivity and low-concentration gas detection. The anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (ARHCF) lasers in the NIR and mid-infrared (MIR) spectral domain show a great potential for spectroscopy and high-resolution gas detection. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of a frequency-comb-like Raman laser with high pulse energy spanning from ultraviolet (UV) (328 nm) to NIR (2065 nm wavelength) based on a hydrogen (H2)-filled 7-ring ARHCF. The gas-filled ARHCF fiber is pumped with a custom-laser at 1044 nm with ~100 {\mu}J pulse energy and a few nanoseconds duration. Through stimulated Raman scattering process, we employ the sixth-order Stokes as case example located at ~1650 nm to demonstrate how the developed high-energy and narrow-linewidth laser source can effectively be used to detect CH4 in the NIR-II region using the photoacoustic modality. We report the efficient detection of CH4 with sensitivity as low as ~550 ppb with an integration time of ~40 s. In conclusion, the main goal of this work is to demonstrate and emphasize the potential of the gas-filled ARHCF laser technology for compact next-generation spectroscopy across different spectral regions.</description>

      <title>Bessel beam fabrication of graphitic micro electrodes in diamond using laser bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the fabrication of conductive graphitic microelectrodes in diamond by using pulsed Bessel beams in the burst mode laser writing regime. The graphitic wires are created in the bulk of a 500 {\mu}m thick monocrystalline HPHT diamond (with (100) orientation) perpendicular to the sample surface, without beam scanning or sample translation. In particular, the role of different burst features in the resistivity of such electrodes is investigated for two very different sub-pulse durations namely 200 fs and 10 ps, together with the role of thermal annealing. Micro-Raman spectroscopy is implemented to investigate the laser-induced crystalline modification, and the results obtained by using two different laser repetition rates, namely 20 Hz and 200 kHz, are compared. A comparison of the micro-Raman spectra and of the resistivity of the electrodes fabricated respectively with 10 ps single pulses and with bursts (of sub-pulses) of similar total duration has also been made, and we show that the burst mode writing regime allows to fabricate more conductive micro electrodes, thanks to the heat accumulation process leading to stronger graphitization. Moreover, the microfabrication of diamond by means of the longest available bursts (~ 46.7 ps duration) featured by 32 sub-pulses of 200 fs duration, with intra-burst time delay of 1.5 ps (sub-THz bursts), leads to graphitic wires with the lowest resistivity values obtained in this work, especially at low repetition rate such as 20 Hz. Indeed, micro electrodes with resistivity on the order of 0.01 {\Omega} cm can be fabricated by Bessel beams in the burst mode regime even when the bursts are constituted by femtosecond laser sub-pulses, in contrast with the results of the standard writing regime with single fs pulses typically leading to less conductive micro electrodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) simulation plays a crucial role in analyzing and designing devices with sub-wavelength scale structures such as solar cells, semiconductor devices, image sensors, future displays and integrated photonic devices. Specifically, optics problems such as estimating semiconductor device structures and designing nanophotonic devices provide intriguing research topics with far-reaching real world impact. Traditional algorithms for such tasks require iteratively refining parameters through simulations, which often yield sub-optimal results due to the high computational cost of both the algorithms and EM simulations. Machine learning (ML) emerged as a promising candidate to mitigate these challenges, and optics research community has increasingly adopted ML algorithms to obtain results surpassing classical methods across various tasks. To foster a synergistic collaboration between the optics and ML communities, it is essential to have an EM simulation software that is user-friendly for both research communities. To this end, we present Meent, an EM simulation software that employs rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). Developed in Python and equipped with automatic differentiation (AD) capabilities, Meent serves as a versatile platform for integrating ML into optics research and vice versa. To demonstrate its utility as a research platform, we present three applications of Meent: 1) generating a dataset for training neural operator, 2) serving as an environment for the reinforcement learning of nanophotonic device optimization, and 3) providing a solution for inverse problems with gradient-based optimizers. These applications highlight Meent's potential to advance both EM simulation and ML methodologies. The code is available at https://github.com/kc-ml2/meent with the MIT license to promote the cross-polinations of ideas among academic researchers and industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Long-range interactions in Weyl dense atomic arrays protected from dissipation and disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are a key resource in many quantum phenomena and technologies. Free-space photons mediate power-law interactions but lack tunability and suffer from decoherence processes due to their omnidirectional emission. Engineered dielectrics can yield tunable and coherent interactions, but typically at the expense of making them both shorter-ranged and sensitive to material disorder and photon loss. Here, we propose a platform that can circumvent all these limitations based on three-dimensional subwavelength atomic arrays subjected to magnetic fields. Our key result is to show how to design the polaritonic bands of these atomic metamaterials to feature a pair of frequency-isolated Weyl points. These Weyl excitations can thus mediate interactions that are simultaneously long-range, due to their gapless nature; robust, due to the topological protection of Weyl points; and decoherence-free, due to their subradiant character. We demonstrate the robustness of these isolated Weyl points for a large regime of interatomic distances and magnetic field values and characterize the emergence of their corresponding Fermi arcs surface states. The latter can as well lead to two-dimensional, non-reciprocal atomic interactions with no analogue in other chiral quantum optical setups.</description>

      <title>On the Dual-Phase-Lag thermal response in the Pulsed Photoacoustic effect: 1D approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Photoacoustic (PA) effect is the mechanism to convert non-ionizing electromagnetic energy into mechanical one; its main application is PA imaging in biomedicine. In this work, and in order to consider the heat flux non-heuristically, we obtained exact solutions of a 1D boundary value problem of the Dual-Phase-Lag (DPL) heat conduction equation for a three-layer system in the frequency domain; once the thermal boundary problem was solved via the DPL model, the second derivative of temperature solutions were considered as the PA source in the respective 1D boundary value problem for the pressures, via the PA wave equation. Temperature and pressure solutions were explored by assuming two considerations; being the first one, that the characteristic thermal lag response time $\tau_{_T}$ related with the DPL heat conduction model, is a free parameter on this effective model. The second one is that for the sake of simplicity, the whole is system is assumed to have the same value for the $\tau_{_T}$, i.e., the three-layer system relax thermally in the same way. Both assumptions are made, since up to our knowledge, there are not first-principles proposals for the values of this parameter, nor experimental measurements available in the literature. By varying $\tau_{_T}$, theoretical solutions for pressure can be adjusted to reproduce experimental results accurately; we have found that under this assumption if $\tau_{_T}$ is close to the laser pulse time $\tau_p$, acoustic multiple reflections are accurately reproduced in the frequency domain and, via Fast Fourier transforms, PA pulses are also reproduced accurately in the time domain.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional optomechanical crystal for quantum transduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated optomechanical systems are one of the leading platforms for manipulating, sensing, and distributing quantum information. The temperature increase due to residual optical absorption sets the ultimate limit on performance for these applications. In this work, we demonstrate a two-dimensional optomechanical crystal geometry, named \textbf{b-dagger}, that alleviates this problem through increased thermal anchoring to the surrounding material. Our mechanical mode operates at 7.4 GHz, well within the operation range of standard cryogenic microwave hardware and piezoelectric transducers. The enhanced thermalization combined with the large optomechanical coupling rates, $g_0/2\pi \approx 880~\mathrm{kHz}$, and high optical quality factors, $Q_\text{opt} = 2.4 \times 10^5$, enables the ground-state cooling of the acoustic mode to phononic occupancies as low as $n_\text{m} = 0.35$ from an initial temperature of 3 kelvin, as well as entering the optomechanical strong-coupling regime. Finally, we perform pulsed sideband asymmetry of our devices at a temperature below 10 millikelvin and demonstrate ground-state operation ($n_\text{m} &lt; 0.45$) for repetition rates as high as 3 MHz. Our results extend the boundaries of optomechanical system capabilities and establish a robust foundation for the next generation of microwave-to-optical transducers with entanglement rates overcoming the decoherence rates of state-of-the-art superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points in optical systems: A resonant-state expansion study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in open optical systems are rigorously studied using the resonant-state expansion (RSE). A spherical resonator, specifically a homogeneous dielectric sphere in a vacuum, perturbed by two point-like defects which break the spherical symmetry and bring the optical modes to EPs, is used as a worked example. The RSE is a non-perturbative approach encoding the information about an open optical system in matrix form in a rigorous way, and thus offering a suitable tool for studying its EPs. These are simultaneous degeneracies of the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of the system, which are rigorously described by the RSE and illustrated for perturbed whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). An exceptional arc, which is a line of adjacent EPs, is obtained analytically for perturbed dipolar WGMs. Perturbation of high-quality WGMs with large angular momentum and their EPs are found by reducing the RSE equation to a two-state problem by means of an orthogonal transformation of a large RSE matrix. WGM pairs have opposite chirality in spherically symmetric systems and equal chirality at EPs. This chirality at EPs can be observed in circular dichroism measurements, as it manifested itself in a squared-Lorentzian part of the optical spectra, which we demonstrate here analytically and numerically in the Purcell enhancement factor for the perturbed dipolar WGMs.</description>

      <title>Fundamental scaling limits and bandwidth shaping of frequency-modulated combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-modulated (FM) combs based on active cavities like quantum cascade lasers have recently emerged as promising light sources in many spectral regions. Unlike passive modelocking, which uses amplitude modulation to generate amplitude modulation, FM combs use phase modulation to generate phase modulation. They can therefore be regarded as a phase-domain version of passive modelocking. However, while the ultimate scaling laws of passive modelocking have long been known -- Haus showed in 1975 that pulses have a bandwidth proportional to effective gain bandwidth -- the limits of FM combs have been much less clear. Here, we show that FM combs are governed by the same fundamental limits, producing combs whose bandwidths are linear in the effective gain bandwidth. Not only do we show theoretically that the diffusive effect of gain curvature limits comb bandwidth, we also show experimentally how this limit can be increased. By adding carefully designed resonant-loss structures that are evanescently coupled to the cavity of a terahertz laser, we reduce the curvature and increase the effective gain bandwidth of the laser, demonstrating bandwidth enhancement. Our results give a new degree of freedom for the creation of active chip-scale combs and can be applied to a wide array of cavity geometries.</description>

      <title>Influence of resonant plasmonic nanoparticles on optically accessing the valley degree of freedom in 2D semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom is one of the most intriguing properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. Together with the possibility to address this degree of freedom by valley-contrasting optical selection rules, it has the potential to enable a completely new class of future electronic and optoelectronic devices. Resonant optical nanostructures emerge as promising tools for interacting with and controlling the valley degree of freedom at the nanoscale. However, a critical understanding gap remains in how nanostructures and their nearfields affect the circular polarization properties of valley-selective emission hindering further developments in this field. In order to address this issue, our study delves into the experimental investigation of a hybrid model system where valley-specific emission from a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide is interacting with a resonant plasmonic nanosphere. Contrary to the simple intuition suggesting that a centrosymmetric nanoresonator preserves the degree of circular polarization in the forward scattered farfield by angular momentum conservation, our cryogenic photoluminescence microscopy reveals that the light emitted from the nanoparticle position is largely unpolarized, i.e. we observe depolarization. We rigorously study the nature of this phenomenon numerically considering the monolayer-nanoparticle interaction at different levels including excitation and emission. In doing so, we find that the farfield degree of polarization strongly reduces in the hybrid system when including excitons emitting from outside of the system's symmetry point, which in combination with depolarisation at the excitation level causes the observed effect. Our results highlight the importance of considering spatially distributed emitters for precise predictions of polarization responses in these hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Quasidiscrete spectrum Cherenkov radiation by a charge moving inside a dielectric waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Cherenkov radiation by a charge uniformly moving inside a dielectric cylindrical channel in a homogeneous medium. The expressions for the Fourier components of the electric and magnetic fields are derived by using the electromagnetic field Green tensor. The spectral distribution of the Cherenkov radiation intensity in the exterior medium is studied for the general case of frequency dispersion of the interior and exterior dielectric functions. It is shown that, under certain conditions on the dielectric permittivities, strong narrow peaks appear in the spectral distribution. The spectral locations of those peaks are specified and their heights and widths are estimated analytically on the base of the dispersion equation for the electromagnetic eigenmodes of the cylinder.</description>

      <title>Amplified linear and nonlinear chiral sensing assisted by anapole modes in hybrid metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between chiral molecules and circularly polarized light is largely influenced by the local optical chirality density. This interaction prompts substantial demand of the design of nanophotonic platforms capable of enhancing such effects across large and accessible volumes. Such a magnification requires nanostructures that provide strong electric and magnetic field enhancements while preserving the phase relation of circular light. Dielectric nanostructures, particularly those able to support resonances, are ideal candidates for this task due to their capacity for high electric and magnetic field enhancements. On the other hand, efficient third harmonic generation calls for strong electric field resonances within dielectric materials, a feature often boosted by incorporating plasmonic materials into hybrid systems. In this work, we numerically propose a coupled silicon disk-gold ring system that can exploit the anapole-induced field confinement to provide a broadband magnified circular dichroism under realistic conditions, reaching values up to a 230-fold enhancement. We also demonstrate that this structure can be employed as an efficient third harmonic generator which, when integrated with chiral media, enables an 800-fold enhancement in circular dichroism. Furthermore, we show that pulsed illumination at intensities up to 10 GW/cm2 does not induce temperature increments that could potentially damage the samples. These findings suggest that this system can be a promising and versatile approach towards ultrasensitive chiral sensing.</description>

Abstract: Topological materials provide a platform that utilizes the geometric characteristics of structured materials to control the flow of waves, enabling unidirectional and protected transmission that is immune to defects or impurities. The topologically designed photonic materials can carry quantum states and electromagnetic energy, benefiting nanolasers or quantum photonic systems. This article reviews recent advances in the topological applications of photonic materials for radiative heat transfer, especially in the near field. When the separation distance between media is considerably smaller than the thermal wavelength, the heat transfer exhibits super-Planckian behavior that surpasses Planck's blackbody predictions. Near-field thermal radiation in subwavelength systems supporting surface modes has various applications, including nanoscale thermal management and energy conversion. Photonic materials and structures that support topological surface states show immense potential for enhancing or suppressing near-field thermal radiation. We present various topological effects, such as periodic and quasi-periodic nanoparticle arrays, Dirac and Weyl semimetal-based materials, structures with broken global symmetries, and other topological insulators, on near-field heat transfer. Also, the possibility of realizing near-field thermal radiation in such topological materials for alternative thermal management and heat flux guiding in nano-scale systems is discussed based on the existing technology.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Imaging of Orbital Vortex Lines in Three-Dimensional Momentum Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental discovery of orbital vortex lines in the three-dimensional (3D) band structure of a topological semimetal. Combining linear and circular dichroism in soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission (SX-ARPES) with first-principles theory, we image the winding of atomic orbital angular momentum, thereby revealing - and determining the location of - lines of vorticity in full 3D momentum space. Our observation of momentum-space vortex lines with quantized winding number establishes an analogue to real-space quantum vortices, for instance, in type-II superconductors and certain non-collinear magnets. These results establish multimodal dichroism in SX-ARPES as an approach to trace 3D orbital textures. Our present findings particularly constitute the first imaging of non-trivial quantum-phase winding at line nodes and may pave the way to new orbitronic phenomena in quantum materials</description>
