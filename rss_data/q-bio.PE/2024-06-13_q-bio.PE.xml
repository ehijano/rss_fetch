      <title>Recombination enables higher numbers of recessive genes, contributing to the emergence of sexual mating in complex organisms</title>

Abstract: The drift-barrier hypothesis states that random genetic drift constrains the refinement of a phenotype under natural selection. The influence of effective population size and the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate were studied theoretically, and an inverse relationship between mutation rate and genome size has been observed for many species. However, the effect of the recessive gene count, an important feature of the genomic architecture, is unknown. In a Wright-Fisher model, we studied the mutation burden for a growing number of N completely recessive and lethal disease genes. Diploid individuals are represented with a binary $2 \times N$ matrix denoting wild-type and mutated alleles. Analytic results for specific cases were complemented by simulations across a broad parameter regime for gene count, mutation and recombination rates. Simulations revealed transitions to higher mutation burden and prevalence within a few generations that were linked to the extinction of the wild-type haplotype (least-loaded class). This metastability, that is, phases of quasi-equilibrium with intermittent transitions, persists over $100\,000$ generations. The drift-barrier hypothesis is confirmed by a high mutation burden resulting in population collapse. Simulations showed the emergence of mutually exclusive haplotypes for a mutation rate above 0.02 lethal equivalents per generation for a genomic architecture and population size representing complex multicellular organisms such as humans. In such systems, recombination proves pivotal, preventing population collapse and maintaining a mutation burden below 10. This study advances our understanding of gene pool stability, and particularly the role of the number of recessive disorders. Insights into Muller`s ratchet dynamics are provided, and the essential role of recombination in curbing mutation burden and stabilizing the gene pool is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Foundations for reconstructing early microbial life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For more than 3.5 billion years, life experienced dramatic environmental extremes on Earth. These include shifts from oxygen-less to over-oxygenated atmospheres and cycling between hothouse conditions and global glaciations. Meanwhile, an ecological revolution took place. The planet evolved from one dominated by microbial life to one containing the plants and animals that are most familiar today. The activities of many key cellular inventions evolved early in the history of life, collectively defining the nature of our biosphere and underpinning human survival. There is a critical need for a new disciplinary synthesis to reveal how microbes and their molecular systems survived ever changing global conditions over deep time. This review critically examines our current understanding of early microbial life and describes the foundations of an emerging area in microbiology and evolutionary synthetic biology to reconstruct the earliest microbial innovations.</description>

      <title>Solving the Tree Containment Problem Using Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Tree Containment is a fundamental problem in phylogenetics useful for verifying a proposed phylogenetic network, representing the evolutionary history of certain species. Tree Containment asks whether the given phylogenetic tree (for instance, constructed from a DNA fragment showing tree-like evolution) is contained in the given phylogenetic network. In the general case, this is an NP-complete problem. We propose to solve it approximately using Graph Neural Networks. In particular, we propose to combine the given network and the tree and apply a Graph Neural Network to this network-tree graph. This way, we achieve the capability of solving the tree containment instances representing a larger number of species than the instances contained in the training dataset (i.e., our algorithm has the inductive learning ability). Our algorithm demonstrates an accuracy of over $95\%$ in solving the tree containment problem on instances with up to 100 leaves.</description>

      <title>Smoothly vanishing density in the contact process by an interplay of disorder and long-distance dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic modeling of ecological population dynamics requires spatially explicit descriptions that can take into account spatial heterogeneity as well as long-distance dispersal. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations and numerical renormalization group results for the paradigmatic model, the contact process, in the combined presence of these factors in both one and two-dimensional systems. Our results confirm our analytic arguments stating that the density vanishes smoothly at the extinction threshold, in a way characteristic of infinite-order transitions. This extremely smooth vanishing of the global density entails an enhanced exposure of the population to extinction events. At the same time, a reverse order parameter, the local persistence displays a discontinuity characteristic of mixed-order transitions, as it approaches a non-universal critical value algebraically with an exponent $\beta_p'&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting institutional punishment in the $N$-person prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conflict between individual and collective interests makes fostering cooperation in human societies a challenging task, requiring drastic measures such as the establishment of sanctioning institutions. These institutions are costly because they have to be maintained regardless of the presence or absence of offenders. Here, we propose realistic improvements to the standard $N$-person prisoner's dilemma formulation with institutional punishment by eliminating overpunishment, requiring a minimum number of contributors to establish the sanctioning institution, and sharing the cost among them once this minimum number is reached. In addition, we focus on large groups or communities for which sanctioning institutions are ubiquitous. Using the replicator equation framework for an infinite population, we find that by sufficiently fining players who fail to contribute either to the public good or to the sanctioning institution, a population of contributors immune to invasion by these free riders can be established, provided that the contributors are sufficiently numerous. In a finite population, we use finite-size scaling to show that, for some parameter settings, demographic noise helps to fixate the strategy that contributes to the public good but not to the sanctioning institution even for infinitely large populations when, somewhat counterintuitively, its proportion in the initial population vanishes with a small power of the population size.</description>
