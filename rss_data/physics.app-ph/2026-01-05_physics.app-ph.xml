      <title>Carbogels for sustainable and scalable thermoelectric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) based on commercially used thermal super-insulating materials can facilitate sustainable and large-scale ambient waste heat recovery while bequeathing an added economic and environmental value to thermal insulations in industry. This requires the optimization of the thermoelectric (TE) properties through electrical functionalization of such materials. Moreover, the associated engineering challenges of assembling TEG modules must be overcome. Herein, we propose using super-insulating Resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) carbogels for scalable and sustainable TE applications through their electrical functionalization. Using a combination of a pyrolysis process and carbon fibers insertion, we achieved an increment by 12 orders of magnitude in electrical conductivity as well as ZT whilst retaining their intrinsic ultralow thermal conductivity (&lt;50 mW/mK). A TE module in the form of a thermoelectric vacuum insulation panel (TVIP), was then fabricated using only a p-type material, to demonstrate a proof-of-concept self-powered WiFi-based vacuum-failure detection application in confined spaces in automobiles or aeronautics. Finally, by extrapolating the optimized output power and with a CAD-assisted assembly of a large TEG module (1000 cm2), the potential of scalable low-grade waste heat recovery is discussed.</description>

      <title>Experimental study on an S-band near-field microwave magnetron power transmission system on hundred-watt level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-magnetron microwave source, a metamaterial transmitting antenna, and a large power rectenna array are presented to build a near-field 2.45 GHz microwave power transmission system. The square 1 m2 rectenna array consists of sixteen rectennas with 2048 Schottky diodes for large power microwave rectifying. It receives microwave power and converts them into DC power. The design, structure, and measured performance of a unit rectenna as well as the entail rectenna array are presented in detail. The multi-magnetron microwave power source switches between half and full output power levels, i.e. the half-wave and full-wave modes. The transmission antenna is formed by a double-layer metallic hole array, which is applied to combine the output power of each magnetron. The rectenna array DC output power reaches 67.3 W on a 1.2 ohm DC load at a distance of 5.5 m from the transmission antenna. DC output power is affected by the distance, DC load, and the mode of microwave power source. It shows that conventional low power Schottky diodes can be applied to a microwave power transmission system with simple magnetrons to realise large power microwave rectifying.</description>

      <title>Novel miniaturized low-pass filters from artificial transmission line structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel design on miniaturized low-pass filters from artificial transmission line structures is proposed. Reactance components, i.e. capacitors and inductors, are directly constructed from microstrip structures based on electromagnetic simulation and parameter extraction. The constructed reactance components are integrated to build low-pass filters. The results of two 5th-order Butterworth and 0.5 dB ripple Chebyshev low-pass filters, which are realized by the proposed method, are presented. The proposed low-pass filter is compact and its size is only 23% of a conventional filter. The simulation agrees well to the measurements, which shows the validation of the proposed design method. The miniaturized low-pass filters have good applications in microwave systems.</description>

      <title>New RVE concept in thermoelasticity of periodic composites subjected to compact support loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for linear thermoelastic composites (CMs) with periodic microstructures. The approach is based on an exact new Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), formulated for compactly supported loading conditions, such as body forces and localized thermal effects (for example laser heating). In addition, new general integral equations (GIEs) are established for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading. A unified iterative scheme is developed for solving the static AGIEs, where the compact support of loading serves as a new fundamental training parameter. At the core of the methodology lies a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept that extends Hill classical definition of the RVE. Unlike conventional RVEs, this generalized RVE is not fixed geometrically but emerges naturally from the characteristic scale of localized loading, thereby reducing the analysis of an infinite periodic medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies. Furthermore, the AGIE-based CAM framework integrates seamlessly with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, supporting the development of accurate, physics-informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Additive general integral equations in thermoelastic micromechanics of composites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an enhanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for the analysis of linear thermoelastic composite materials (CMs) with random microstructure. The proposed approach is grounded in an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), specifically formulated for compactly supported loading, including both body forces and localized thermal changes (such as those from laser heating). New general integral equations (GIEs) for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading are proposed. A unified iterative solution strategy is developed for the static AGIE, applicable to CMs with both perfectly and imperfectly bonded interfaces, where the compact support of loading is introduced as a new fundamental training parameter. Central to this methodology is a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill classical definition. The resulting RVE is not predefined geometrically, but rather emerges from the characteristic scale of the localized loading, effectively reducing the analysis of an infinite, randomly heterogeneous medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This generalized RVE approach enables automatic exclusion of unrepresentative subsets of effective parameters, while inherently eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite size limitations. Moreover, the AGIE-based CAM framework is naturally compatible with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, facilitating the construction of accurate and physically informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Spectral Sampling of Boron Diffusion in Ni Alloys: Cr and Mo Effects on Bulk and Grain Boundary Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how light interstitials migrate in chemically complex alloys is essential for predicting defect dynamics and long-term stability. Here, we introduce a spectral sampling framework to quantify boron diffusion activation energies in Ni and demonstrate how substitutional solutes (Cr, Mo) reshape interstitial point defect transport in both the bulk and along crystallographic defects. In the bulk, boron migration energy distributions exhibit distinct modality tied to solute identity and spatial arrangement: both Cr and Mo raise barriers in symmetric cages but induce directional asymmetry in partially decorated environments. Extending this framework to a $\Sigma5\langle100\rangle{210}$ symmetric tilt grain boundary reveals solute-specific confinement effects. Cr preserves low-barrier in-plane mobility while suppressing out-of-plane transport, guiding boron into favorable midplane voids. Mo, by contrast, imposes an across-the-board reduction in boron mobility, suppressing average diffusivity by two additional orders of magnitude at 800 $^\circ$C and reducing out-of-plane transport by five orders of magnitude relative to Cr. Both elements promote segregation by producing negative segregation energies, but their roles diverge: Cr facilitates rapid redistribution and stabilization at interfacial sites, consistent with Cr-rich boride formation, while Mo creates deeper and more uniform segregation wells that strongly anchor boron. Together, these complementary behaviors explain the experimental prevalence of Cr- and Mo-rich borides at grain boundaries and carbide interfaces in Ni-based superalloys. More broadly, we establish spectral sampling as a transferable framework for interpreting diffusion in disordered alloys and for designing dopant strategies that control transport across complex interfaces.</description>

      <title>Towards a temperature-insensitive composite diamond clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency references based on solid state spins promise simplicity, compactness, robustness, multifunctionality, ease of integration, and high densities of emitters. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a natural candidate, but the electronic zero-field splitting exhibits a large fractional temperature dependence, which has precluded its use as a stable clock transition. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by forming a composite frequency reference that combines measurements of the electronic splitting D with the nuclear quadrupole splitting of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin intrinsic to the NV center. We further benchmark this composite approach against alternative strategies for mitigating temperature sensitivity. By implementing a specially designed pulse sequence with an eight-phase control scheme that suppresses pulse imperfections, we interleave measurements of D and Q in a high-density NV ensemble and demonstrate a temperature-compensated composite frequency reference. The stability of this composite diamond clock is characterized over a 10-day period at room temperature through a comparison to a Rb vapor-cell clock, yielding a fractional instability below $5 \times 10^{-9}$ for an averaging time of $\tau = 200$ s and below $1 \times 10^{-8}$ at $\tau = 2 \times 10^5$ s, corresponding to measured improvements by a factor of 4 and 200, respectively, over a clock based purely on the single frequency D for the same periods. By characterizing the residual sensitivity to magnetic fields, optical power, and radio-frequency drive amplitudes, we find that temperature is no longer the dominant source of instability. These results establish complementary electron- and nuclear-spin transitions in diamond as a viable route to thermally robust frequency metrology, providing a pathway toward compact, multifunctional solid-state clocks and quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential application of non-thermal plasma in treating textile industrial wastewater motivates researchers to develop innovative techniques at a laboratory scale to achieve the goal of wastewater mineralization. In line with this objective, a dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode has been built for the study of synthetic dye degradation. The plasma reactor was optimized by altering various operating conditions to achieve a higher degradation efficiency at given discharge conditions. The reaction kinetics of crystal violet degradation were studied, and the same plasma reactor was tested for other synthetic dyes (wastewater model samples). The results suggest that the proposed dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor may offer a promising solution for treating dye effluents from the textile industry.</description>

      <title>Multispectral UV Imaging on Capacitive CMOS Arrays Enabled by Solution-Processed Metal-Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) imagers are important for a variety of applications, such as quality inspection in the semiconductor industry, forensics and food quality inspection, but are often costly because they require dedicated semiconductor process flows. Here, an imaging chip is introduced that has been fabricated using standard 40 nm complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology. Instead of using a conventional charge-based photodetection principle, the imager uses a capacitive operation principle where UV-light causes capacitance changes via the photodielectric effect in a functionalization layer, which are measured by the underlying CMOS circuitry. This spin-coated or inkjet-printed functionalization layer consists of solution-processed, wide-bandgap, semiconducting metaloxide nanoparticles, and facilitates multispectral imaging. The sensors exhibit low noiseequivalent powers (17-138 fW Hz^-1/2) across the UV bands. Unlike conventional silicon CMOS imagers, the present capacitive-CMOS platform is inherently visible-blind, providing selective UV detection. This work positions late-functionalized capacitive-CMOS arrays as a route toward reducing the cost of UV imagers, which can lead to their more widespread implementation in consumer and low-volume application-specific products.</description>

      <title>$\Delta_T$ Noise from Electron-Hole Asymmetry in Normal and Superconducting Quantum Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines $\Delta_T$ noise in two-terminal hybrid nanostructures featuring a quantum point contact (QPC), realized either between two normal metals (NQN) or between a normal metal and a superconductor (NQS). The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $\Delta_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $\Delta_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $\Delta_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $\Delta_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $\Delta_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime.</description>

      <title>Coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical phase field-based modelling of hydrogen-assisted cracking in girth welds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new computational framework is presented to predict the structural integrity of welds in hydrogen transmission pipelines. The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.</description>

      <title>Automated decision-making by chemical echolocation in active droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile microorganisms, like bacteria and algae, unify abilities like self-propulsion, autonomous navigation, and decision-making on the micron scale. While recent breakthroughs have led to the creation of synthetic microswimmers and nanoagents that can also self-propel, they still lack the functionality and sophistication of their biological counterparts. This study pioneers a mechanism enabling synthetic agents to autonomously navigate and make decisions, allowing them to solve mazes and transport cargo through complex environments without requiring external cues or guidance. The mechanism exploits chemo-hydrodynamic signals, produced by agents like active droplets or colloids, to remotely sense and respond to their environment - similar to echolocation. Our research paves the way for endowing autonomous, motile synthetic agents with functionalities that have been so far exclusive to biological organisms.</description>

      <title>Prediction of a measurable sign change in the Casimir force using a magnetic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum levitation controlled by Casimir forces acting between a polystyrene surface and a Teflon-coated metallic substrate immersed in a mixture of Toluene and magnetite particles. This system experiences repulsion-attraction transitions in the Casimir interaction for distances where the effect is measurable. This Casimir trapping can be controlled by clever choices of metallic and ferrofluid materials, which are directly linked to the emergence of the trapping effect. Thermal and quantum contributions are investigated in detail, showing how the optical and magnetic properties of the ferrofluid and other materials affect the magnitude of the trapping and its distance range of observability.</description>

      <title>Casimir interactions and drift currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</description>

      <title>Anti-reflection coatings for highly anisotropic materials in the mid infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and optimize thin anti-reflection coatings (ARCs) for highly anisotropic materials in the mid infrared. Unlike conventional ARCs that assume nearly isotropic refractive indices, this work fully integrates the anisotropic nature of materials into the design process. We describe two designs of thin ARCs for highly anisotropic materials: a single form-birefringent layer, and a planar bilayer. We realized the planar bilayer ARC experimentally, demonstrating excellent mid-infrared anti-reflectance across over a broad range of angles for all polarizations.</description>

      <title>Stimulation of surface ionization waves by pulsed laser irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of semiconducting material within a composite barrier enables the perfectly uniform propagation of surface ionization waves (SIW) in air at atmospheric pressure regardless of the polarity of the applied electric field, unlike surface discharges generated using purely dielectric barriers. We exploit the photonic properties of silicon to stimulate the SIW using external irradiation by a 2-ns pulsed laser at 532 nm, with a fluence of 1.3 mJ/cm$^2$ per pulse at the surface. No effect is observed when irradiation occurs more than 3 $\mu$s before plasma generation. This timescale is attributed to the ambipolar diffusion of photoexcited carriers away from the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. When this delay shortens to less than 3 $\mu$s, the SIW propagates farther and with more intense optical emission. Furthermore, the energy of the discharge increases by up to 7%. The sensitivity to the laser-plasma delay demonstrates that the observed stimulation of the SIW cannot be due to the desorption of surface charge by irradiation.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Full-band GaN HEMT Simulation Suggests Upper Bound of LO Phonon Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsic limits to device performance arise from fundamental material properties that define the best achievable operation, independent of engineering constraints. In GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), hot longitudinal optical (LO) phonons can act as an intrinsic performance bottleneck by reducing electron saturation velocity, output current, and transconductance, which are key device metrics. While bulk GaN studies report LO phonon lifetimes of approximately 1 ps, leading to strong nonequilibrium phonon populations, ungated heterostructures show much shorter lifetimes of only tens of femtoseconds. Because direct measurement inside a HEMT channel is challenging, the true impact of hot phonons remains uncertain. Using full-band transport simulations of a fabricated GaN HEMT, we show that LO phonon lifetimes must be less than about 40 fs to reproduce measured I-V characteristics, consistent with ultrafast decay observed in GaN heterostructures. We further demonstrate that even these ultrafast lifetimes are not sufficient to eliminate hot phonon effects: the residual nonequilibrium LO population continues to limit the current density at high bias. Moreover, when the LO phonon lifetime exceeds a few tens of femtoseconds, a pronounced hot phonon bottleneck emerges, leading to substantial current-density suppression that is inconsistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade Mediated by Two-Photon Absorption in an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.</description>

      <title>Tamm Plasmon--Enhanced Widely Tunable Near-Infrared Nanolaser with Superior Efficiency and Output Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic resonances enable strong electromagnetic field confinement and have been widely exploited in plasmonic nanolasers, particularly through surface plasmon polaritons and localized surface plasmons. However, their performance is often limited by bidirectional output coupling and multimode far-field emission, primarily due to higher-order diffraction arising from these modes. In this work, we utilize the Tamm plasmon resonance to realize lasing in the NIR region with wide tunability. The optical Tamm states are excited at the metal-DBR interface by an incident pump pulse and their emission intensity is significantly enhanced via extraordinary optical transmission through a metallic nanohole array. The subwavelength periodicity of the nanohole array restricts the emission to the zeroth order, resulting in a highly directional far-field pattern with a full width at half maximum of approximately 0.631 degrees. To further improve performance, a second DBR is incorporated beneath the pump side, which substantially suppresses backward emission around the lasing wavelength and enhances forward lasing intensity by around 1.3 X 10^4 times, thus increasing the integrated emission power. The combination of Tamm plasmon excitation and dual-DBR feedback significantly improves the cavity's optical response and overall lasing efficiency. Additionally, we have demonstrated lasing at 870 nm with a reduced pump threshold of 2.8 X 10^7 V/m (energy of 0.0031 mJ/cm^2). Moreover, a broad tunability in lasing wavelength, spanning from 850 nm to 944.5 nm, is achieved. These results demonstrate a cost-effective and versatile strategy for plasmonic nanolasers with enhanced output power, low reflection-side loss, wide tunability, and strong integration potential for on-chip photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>
