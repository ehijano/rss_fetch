      <title>Single arm interferometry to probe the scalar field dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the interaction of photons with a scalar dark matter field \phi and we propose to use a single arm interferometer to reveal this interaction and constrain the parameters of the scalar dark matter model. By considering a beam of coherent light and two spatially separated squeezing operations, we show that the interaction of photons with scalar dark matter leads to an observable deviation in the outgoing light state, with respect to free evolution. Therefore the single arm interferometer may yield a novel revelation method for scalar dark matter.</description>

      <title>Fant\^omas: epistemic and nuclear uncertainties for the parton distributions of the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Fanto10, a new ensemble of NLO error parton distribution functions (PDFs) in a charged pion that provides the most detailed estimate of uncertainties from experimental, theoretical, and methodological sources in order to enable faithful comparisons against upcoming precision experiments and ab initio QCD predictions. For the first time, the Fanto10 PDFs quantify two important types of uncertainties, arising from in-depth exploration of feasible functional forms of pion PDFs and from the nuclear PDFs describing the internal composition of the tungsten target in the key E615 data set for pion-nuclear Drell-Yan process. Accounting for these uncertainties modifies physics conclusions of more restrictive analyses about the pion's gluon and quark sea composition. These advancements are made by employing the recently developed C++ framework Fant\^omas for systematic exploration of epistemic sources of PDF uncertainties, such as those arising from the choice of the PDF functional forms and sampling over methodological choices and third-party inputs, e.g., the nuclear PDF uncertainty in the presented case. The framework employs polynomial universal approximators (B\'ezier curves) to parametrize diverse PDF functional forms and reduce biases associated with the PDF parametrization choice. Its other component combines PDF ensembles from multiple preliminary fits into a single published ensemble of Hessian error PDFs. We review key steps of the Fant\^omas methodology, properties of Fanto10 PDFs, and implications for future studies.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in an Evanescent Three-Brane Randall-Sundrum Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apart from its gravitational interactions, dark matter (DM) has remained so far elusive in laboratory searches. One possible explanation is that the relevant interactions to explain its relic abundance are mainly gravitational. In this work we consider an extradimensional Randall-Sundrum scenario with a TeV-PeV IR brane, where the Standard Model is located, and a GeV-TeV deep IR (DIR) one, where the DM lies. When the curvatures of the bulk to the left and right of the IR brane are very similar, the tension of the IR brane is significantly smaller than that of the other two branes, and therefore we term it \evanescent". In this setup, the relic abundance of DM arises from the freezeout mechanism, thanks to DM annihilations into radions and gravitons. Focusing on a scalar singlet DM candidate, we compute and apply current and future constraints from direct, indirect and collider-based searches. Our findings demonstrate the viability of this scenario and highlight its potential testability in upcoming experiments. We also discuss the possibility of inferring the number of branes if the radion and several Kaluza-Klein graviton resonances are detected at a future collider.</description>

      <title>Sampling NNLO QCD phase space with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We showcase the application of neural importance sampling for the evaluation of NNLO QCD scattering cross sections. We consider Normalizing Flows in the form of discrete Coupling Layers and time continuous flows for the integration of the various cross-section contributions when using the sector-improved residue subtraction scheme. We thereby consider the stratification of the integrands into their positive and negative contributions, and separately optimize the phase-space sampler. We exemplify the novel methods for the case of gluonic top-quark pair production at the LHC at NNLO QCD accuracy. We find significant gains with respect to the current default methods used in STRIPPER in terms of reduced cross-section variances and increased unweighting efficiencies. In turn, the computational costs for evaluations of the integrand needed to achieve a certain statistical uncertainty for the cross section can be reduced by a factor 8.</description>

      <title>Viability of post-inflationary freeze-in with precision cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of inflationary observables from the temperature fluctuation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) can play a pivotal role in predicting the reheating dynamics in the early universe. In this work, we highlight how the inflationary observables, in particular the spectral index $n_s$, can play a potential role in constraining the post-inflationary dark matter (DM) production. We demonstrate a novel way of constraining the non-thermal production of DM via UV freeze-in which is otherwise elusive in terrestrial experiments. We consider a scenario in which DM is produced from this thermal plasma via a dimension-five operator. The mutual connection between $n_s$ and relic density of DM via the reheating temperature, $T_{\rm RH}$, enables us to put constraints on the DM parameter space. For the minimal choice of the inflationary model parameters and DM mass between $1\,\rm MeV$ to $1\,\rm TeV$, we found that Planck alone can exclude the cut-off scale of the dimension-five operator $\Lambda \lesssim 10^{12}\,\rm GeV$ which is significantly stronger than any other existing constraints on such minimal scenario. If we impose the combined prediction form Planck and recently released data by ACT, the exclusion limit can reach up to the Planck scale for TeV-scale dark matter.</description>

      <title>Can local White Dwarfs constrain Dark Matter interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether nearby white dwarfs (WDs) can constrain dark matter (DM) interactions with ordinary matter. As experimental sensitivity improves, driven by the Gaia mission, the sample volume of nearby WDs has been increasing over recent years. We carefully select a sample of ten cold, isolated, non-magnetic WDs within 13~pc of the Sun. We model their carbon-oxygen interior using a finite temperature relativistic equation of state and model atmospheres to infer their core temperatures. This enables us to perform a thorough estimation of the DM capture rate and evaporation mass using actual astrophysical observations. Given the low local DM density, we focus on DM that annihilates into long-lived mediators, which escape the WD and later decay into photons. While \textit{Fermi}-LAT data shows no significant gamma-ray excess, future telescopes, CTA North \&amp; South, LHAASO, SWGO, could probe DM-nucleon cross sections down to $\sim 10^{-41}~\text{cm}^2$ for DM masses above the TeV scale. Our results are competitive with current direct detection bounds (e.g., LZ) in the multi-TeV regime. This work underscores the importance of systematic WD studies in the broader landscape of DM detection and demonstrates the synergy between astrophysical and terrestrial searches in exploring DM interactions.</description>

      <title>Numerical Calculation of Coulomb Corrections in Forward Elastic $\boldsymbol{p}^\uparrow\!\!\;\boldsymbol{p}$ and $\boldsymbol{p}^\uparrow\!\boldsymbol{A}$ Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of RHIC hydrogen gas jet target polarimeter measurements of transverse analyzing powers $A_\text{N}(t)$ in proton-nucleus scattering requires accurate Coulomb corrections to both spin-flip and non-flip amplitudes. These corrections must cover a wide range of nuclear charges $Z$ and form factor slopes, with flexibility to vary form factors during data fitting. To avoid technically challenging calculations involving a small but finite fictitious photon mass, the Coulomb correction to the non-flip electromagnetic amplitude with an exponential form factor was related to the corresponding correction for the spin-flip amplitude. This approach allows soft photon contributions to all amplitudes, including those with non-exponential form factors, to be calculated in the massless photon limit using only analytical expressions and numerically stable integrals with nonsingular integrands and finite integration limits. In addition, an absorptive correction to the spin-flip electromagnetic amplitude, which plays a critical role in spin effects in forward polarized proton-nucleus scattering, was accurately evaluated.</description>

      <title>Beauty Hadron Spectrum in a Screened Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass spectrum of beauty hadrons ($b\overline{b}$ and $bbb$ baryons) and $bb$-diquarks are computed in a non-relativistic phenomenological potential model. The potential comprises of a short-range Coulomb potential, a screened confinement potential, and $O(1/m)$ corrections predicted from lattice and pNRQCD studies. Among the spin-dependent interactions, spin-spin interaction is considered non-perturbatively, whereas spin-orbit and tensor interactions are considered perturbatively. The Matrix-Numerov method is used to numerically solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation to evaluate the mass spectra. We interpret $\Upsilon(10753)$ as $D$-wave bottomonium state and $\Upsilon(10860)$ and $\Upsilon(11020)$ as $S$-wave bottomonium states. The mass spectrum of $bbb$ baryons are evaluated under the diquark-quark model. The excited masses are computed by considering various radial and orbital excitations of the diquark as well as the diquark-quark system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems and Superstring Phases in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the string theory dynamics of the volume scalar rolling down an exponential potential during the period between inflation and reheating, in a background of cosmic superstring loops. In the context of the LVS potential, we demonstrate the existence of a novel string loop attractor tracker solution, in which 75% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a gas of fundamental cosmic superstring loops (a configuration preferred over the standard radiation tracker). On this tracker, it is the continual reduction in the string tension as the volume scalar evolves that makes the loops stable against decay. For more general non-LVS potentials, mixed radiation-loop trackers can also occur.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from five-dimensional inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was proposed that five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Moreover, it was shown that 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Here we compute the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and show that unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances, due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times. Moreover there is an additional enhancement in the squeezed limit.</description>

      <title>Holographic quark masses and radiative decays of heavy vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic models of QCD provide the spectrum of heavy vector meson masses and electromagnetic decay constants through bulk computations of the current-current correlation function. Conversely, the phenomenology of heavy vector mesons is articulated by the constituent heavy quark model utilizing a non-relativistic approximation. By applying the Segre formula from non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we derive new observables from holography: the constituent quark mass, the three-photon decay width, the effective fine structure constant of the strong interaction, and the mixed one-photon and two-gluon decay width. We also derive the three-gluon decay width, the three-photon decay width, and the mixed one-photon and two-gluon decay width for the radially excited states of heavy quarkonia and compare them with available experimental data. The present results reveal a new paradigm of meson spectroscopy in AdS/QCD.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Neutrino Secret Interactions from Multi-messenger Neutrinos Scattering on C$\nu$B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new constraints on neutrino secret interactions ($\nu$SI) by studying high-energy neutrinos from well-known astrophysical sources, such as SN1987A, the blazars TXS $0506+056$ and PKS $0735+178$, the active galaxy NGC 1068, and KM3-230213A neutrino event. We extend existing limits by covering a previously unconstrained region of the mediator mass parameter space. Our analysis focuses on Dirac neutrinos interacting with a massive spin-one boson as they propagate through the Cosmic Neutrino Background. We consider both ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, deriving bounds on the $\nu$SI coupling constant across the full $\nu$SI mediator mass range. Our results obtained using analytical methods, demonstrate significant constraints on the $\nu$SI coupling in the low-mass mediator mass region for a given cutoff parameter.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Dimensional Reduction up to Three Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first computation of phase-transition parameters to cubic order in $\lambda\sim m^2/T^2$, where $m$ is the scalar mass and $T$ is the temperature, in a simple model resembling the Higgs sector of the SMEFT. We use dimensional reduction, including 1-loop matching corrections for terms of dimension 6 (in 4-dimensional units), 2-loop contributions for dimension-4 ones and 3-loops for the squared mass. We precisely quantify the size of the different corrections, including renormalisation-group running as well as quantum effects from light fields in the effective theory provided by the Coleman-Weinberg potential, and discuss briefly the implications for gravitational waves. Our results suggest that, for strong phase transitions, 1-loop corrections from dimension-6 operators can compete with 2-loop ones from quartic couplings, but largely surpass those from 3-loop thermal masses.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnetic properties of the Hadron Resonance Gas in the presence of a strong ($0 \le B \le 0.15~{\rm GeV}^2$) uniform magnetic field, using physical values of the magnetic moments of hadrons, i.e., including their anomalous parts. The values of these moments are taken from experiment, or when unavailable, from theoretical estimates. We evaluate the conserved charge susceptibilities, finding the expected sizable effects of the anomalous magnetic moments, in particular of the octet baryons, such as the proton and neutron, where they are exceptionally large. We also study in detail the large effects of the magnetic moments of the $\Delta(1232)$ states, for which various theoretical estimates and experimental values differ significantly. We compare our model results with the lattice QCD data and find reasonable agreement within the model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Neutrinophilic Super-Resonant Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) annihilation can be significantly enhanced through narrow resonances or the Sommerfeld enhancement effect, with both mechanisms potentially combining in a super-resonant annihilation process. In such scenarios, the conventional assumption that kinetic equilibrium persists until chemical decoupling may not hold, leading to substantial impacts on the final DM relic density. However, a strongly enhanced annihilation cross-section into Standard Model particles, except neutrinos, is constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We thus investigate DM annihilation into neutrino pair final states, focusing on the role of kinetic decoupling. We solve the coupled Boltzmann equations to determine the relic density and constrain the parameter space using current experimental data, while also forecasting the sensitivity of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological constraints of the building blocks of the cluster hadronization model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce building blocks for the cluster hadronization model in light of a new structure, focusing on cluster fission and cluster decay. We propose theoretically motivated matrix elements for cluster fission and decay as building blocks and study some first phenomenological implications at different energies. In particular we develop a set of observables which can be used to dissect the hadronization history and have constraining power on the individual building blocks. Our analysis will be completed by including colour reconnection in a follow-up work.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of pQCD energy loss across system size, flavor, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, and $p_T$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present suppression predictions from our pQCD-based energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections, for high-$p_T$ $\pi$, $D$ and $B$ meson $R_{AB}$ as a function of centrality, flavor, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, and $p_T$ from large to small collision systems at RHIC and LHC. A statistical analysis is used to constrain the effective strong coupling in our model to available high-$p_T$ suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, yielding good agreement with all available data. We estimate two important theoretical uncertainties in our model, stemming from: the transition between vacuum and hard thermal loop propagators in the collisional energy loss, and from the angular cutoff on the radiated gluon momentum. We find, consistently, that the extracted $\alpha_s$ remains relatively unchanged across heavy- and light-flavor final states and across central, semi-central, and peripheral collisions. We make predictions from our large-system-constrained model for small systems and find good agreement with photon-normalized $R^{\pi^0}_{d \text{Au}} \simeq 0.75 $ in $0-5\%$ centrality $d$ + Au collisions by PHENIX. However, we find strong disagreement with the measured $R^{h^{\pm}}_{p \text{Pb}} \gtrsim 1$ in $0-5\%$ centrality $p$ + Pb collisions by ALICE and ATLAS; we argue that this disagreement is due, in large part, to centrality bias. We make predictions for the ratio of suppression in ${}^3$He + Au and $p$ + Au collisions, which may in the future be used to disentangle final- from initial-state suppression in small systems. We then compare our results to various subsets of data, which allows us to estimate the preferred: low-$p_T$ scale at which non-perturbative processes become important, scales at which the strong coupling runs, and scale at which vacuum propagators transition to thermally modified propagators in collisional energy loss.</description>

      <title>Modeling Galaxy Surveys with Hybrid SBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys deep into the non-linear regime. Despite its great promise, its application is limited by the computational cost of running simulations that can describe the increasingly-large cosmological datasets. Recent work proposed a hybrid SBI framework (HySBI), which combines SBI on small-scales with perturbation theory (PT) on large-scales, allowing information to be extracted from high-resolution observations without large-volume simulations. In this work, we lay out the HySBI framework for galaxy clustering, a key step towards its application to next-generation datasets. We study the choice of priors on the parameters for modeling galaxies in PT analysis and in simulation-based analyses, as well as investigate their cosmology dependence. By jointly modeling large- and small-scale statistics and their associated nuisance parameters, we show that HySBI can obtain 20\% and 60\% tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, respectively, compared to traditional PT analyses, thus demonstrating the efficacy of this approach to maximally extract information from upcoming spectroscopic datasets.</description>

      <title>Probing Reheating Phase via Non-Helical Magnetogenesis and Secondary Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in observational techniques to enhance our understanding of the universe and its evolutionary processes. However, our knowledge of the post-inflation reheating phase remains limited due to its small-scale dynamics. Traditional observations, such as those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), primarily provide insights into large-scale dynamics, making it challenging to glean information about the reheating era. In this paper, our primary aim is to explore how the generation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) spectra, resulting from electromagnetic fields in the early universe, can offer valuable insights into the Reheating dynamics. We investigate how the spectral shape of GWs varies across different frequency ranges, depending on the initial magnetic profile and reheating dynamics. For this, we consider a well-known non-helical magnetogenesis model, where the usual electromagnetic kinetic term is coupled with a background scalar. Notably, for such a scenario, we observe distinct spectral shapes with sufficiently high amplitudes for different reheating histories with the equation of state parametrized by ($w_{\rm re}$). We identify spectral breaks in the GW spectra for both $w_{\rm re}&lt;1/3$ and $w_{\rm re}&gt;1/3$ scenarios. We find that future GW experiments such as BBO, LISA, SKA, and DECIGO are well within the reach of observing those distinct spectral shapes and can potentially shed light on the underlying mechanism of the reheating phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Proton Structure Functions from Holographic Einstein-Dilaton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the proton structure functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ in the context of holography. We develop a general framework that extends previous holographic calculations of $F_1$ and $F_2$ to the case where the bulk geometry stems from bottom-up Einstein-Dilaton models, which are commonly used in the literature to describe some properties of QCD in the strong coupling regime. We focus on a choice of the dilaton potential that leads to a holographic model able to reproduce known lattice QCD results for the glueball masses at zero temperature and pure Yang-Mills thermodynamics above deconfinement. Once the parameters of the background holographic model are fixed, we introduce probe fermionic and gauge fields in the bulk {\it a la} Polchinski and Strassler to determine the corresponding structure functions. This particular realization of the model can successfully describe the proton mass and provide results for $F_2$ at large $x$ that are in qualitative agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass spectrum to various deformations of the rugby-ball background in 6-dimensional supergravity. We derived the mode equations that contain the 3-dimensional scale factor and the lapse function. By solving these, we numerically evaluate the KK masses for a bulk scalar and a spinor when the background has a nontrivial dependence on the position in the compact space. We clarify some qualitative features of the spectrum deformation for some perturbations of the rugby-ball background. For perturbations of a supersymmetric background, we find that the mass-splitting between bosonic and fermionic modes is much smaller than the deviation from the values of the supersymmetric mass eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Investigating quarkonium collectivity in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions has exhibited properties of a mostly perfect fluid. These properties can be observed through the hydrodynamic expansion of the QGP. Experimentally, this was established by measuring azimuthal anisotropies in the final state, known as elliptic flow ($v_2$) or higher order harmonics such as triangular flow ($v_3$). These Fourier harmonic coefficients have been extensively measured in past experiments using inclusive charged particles or identified particles in the soft sector. Interestingly, measuring such coefficients using hard probes, such as quarkonia, brings additional information about heavy-quarks production and thermalization in the QGP. In this study, we investigate quarkonia collectivity using Run 3 data collected in 2023, presenting new flow measurements. We employ different experimental methods to extract flow coefficients, including the scalar product, event plane, and cumulant methods. These results will impose new constraints on theoretical models, enhancing our understanding of quarkonia behavior in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of the photoproduction of $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ mesons in peripheral $PbPb$ collisions at the center - of - mass energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is performed, considering distinct assumptions for the modeling of the nuclear photon flux, photon - nucleus cross - section, overlap function and dipole - proton scattering amplitude. The comparison of these predictions with the ALICE data is also performed. Our results indicate that a detailed analysis of the production of both mesons will be very useful to improve the description of photon - induced processes in peripheral collisions.</description>

      <title>On entanglement c-functions in confining gauge field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories, with c-functions derived from it serving as candidate measures of the effective number of degrees of freedom. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. In this work, we investigate entanglement c-functions in the context of holographic RG flows, with a particular focus on flows across dimensions induced by circle compactifications. We argue that in spacetime dimensions $d \geq 4$, standard constructions of c-functions, which rely on higher derivatives of the entanglement entropy of either a ball or a cylinder, generically lead to non-monotonic behavior. Working with known dual geometries, we argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicity in the infrared, although a fully monotonic ultraviolet extension remains elusive. Furthermore, motivated by entanglement entropy inequalities, we conjecture a bound on the cylinder entanglement c-function, which holds in all our examples.</description>

      <title>Counterpart-Induced Millisecond-Scale Truncation Mechanism of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed millisecond-scale duration is an essential yet mysterious feature of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this Letter, we link the observed soft gamma-ray counterpart of FRB 200428 to electron-positron pair cascades driven by Compton scattering and the Breit-Wheeler process. We demonstrate that such pair cascades can truncate FRBs to durations down to millisecond-scale, thereby establishing millisecond-scale upper bounds on their durations. The physical processes involved in the truncation mechanism occur during the propagation of FRBs after their production. Consequently, this mechanism is independent of the specific production mechanism or origin of the FRBs, suggesting that it could potentially operate in all FRBs. Our results lift the constraint on FRB production mechanisms that they must inherently generate bursts lasting only milliseconds.</description>

      <title>LaMET's Asymptotic Extrapolation vs. Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) is a physics-guided systematic expansion to calculate light-cone parton distributions, including collinear (PDFs) and transverse-momentum-dependent ones, at any fixed momentum fraction $x$ within a range of $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$. It theoretically solves the ill-posed inverse problem that afflicts other theoretical approaches to collinear PDFs, such as short-distance factorizations. Recently, arXiv:2504.17706~\cite{Dutrieux:2025jed} raised practical concerns about whether current or even future lattice data will have sufficient precision in the sub-asymptotic correlation region to support an error-controlled extrapolation -- and if not, whether it becomes an inverse problem where the relevant uncertainties cannot be properly quantified. While we agree that not all current lattice data have the desired precision to qualify for an asymptotic extrapolation, some calculations do, and more are expected in the future. We comment on the analysis and results in Ref.~\cite{Dutrieux:2025jed} and argue that a physics-based systematic extrapolation still provides the most reliable error estimates, even when the data quality is not ideal. In contrast, re-framing the long-distance asymptotic extrapolation as a data-driven-only inverse problem with {\it ad hoc} mathematical conditioning could lead to unnecessarily conservative errors.</description>

      <title>Left-right splitting of elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions: TRENTo-3D initialization and CLVisc hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the TRENTo-3D initial condition model coupled with (3+1)-dimensional CLVisc hydrodynamic simulations, we systematically investigate the left-right splitting of elliptic flow ($\Delta v_{2}$) for soft particles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our study reveals that the final distribution characteristics of $\Delta v_{2}$ are primarily depend on the odd flow harmonics and $v_{2}$ itself. We find that the parton transverse momentum scale $k_\mathrm{T}$ not only determines the geometric tilt of the QGP fireball but also significantly affects the rapidity dependence of both $v_1$ and $\Delta v_{2}$, providing new insights into the splitting mechanism of $\Delta v_{2}$. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that $\Delta v_{2} (p_\mathrm{T})$ exhibits significant sensitivity to influences such as the sub-nucleonic degrees of freedom (or `hotspots'), transverse momentum scale, and fragmentation region profile. By analyzing the $\Delta v_{2}$ and $\Delta v_{2}/v_{2}$ ratio, our findings provide new constraints on the uncertainties of the QGP initial state and provide additional constraints for refining model parameters.</description>

      <title>Confronting the low-scale seesaw and leptogenesis with neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the impact of heavy neutrinos with masses in the MeV-GeV range on neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in view of updated results for the lifetime of this process. Working in a minimal realistic extension of the Standard Model by two right-handed neutrino flavours, we show that the non-observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ will impose strong bounds on the heavy neutrino properties that are complementary to the limits obtained from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and collider searches. For an inverted mass hierarchy of the light neutrinos we find that improved limits on $0\nu\beta\beta$ from next-generation experiments, assuming an improvement of two orders of magnitude on the current $0\nu\beta\beta$ limits will restrict the allowed parameter space for fixed mass splitting to narrow bands in the mass-mixing plane. Further combining this with the requirement to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis reduces these bands to windows in parameter space that are constrained in all directions and can be targeted by direct searches at accelerators, and restricts the mass splitting to values that can be resolved at experiments. For a normal mass hierarchy, restricting the allowed parameter will require even stronger $0\nu\beta\beta$ limits, and only parts of the parameter space can then be probed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that $D\rightarrow P\eta^\prime$ decay amplitudes, where $P=K,\pi,\eta$, cannot be simply related to their $D\rightarrow P\eta$ counterparts with a single $\eta_0$--$\eta_8$ mixing angle. We propose a novel, consistent treatment of $\eta_0$--$\eta_8$ mixing for application in $D\to P\eta$ and $D\to P\eta^\prime$ decays. Using this framework, we perform a global analysis of $D\rightarrow P\eta^\prime$ decays employing SU(3)$_F$ symmetry including linear SU(3)$_F$ breaking. We find that the assumption of 30\% SU(3)$_F$ breaking is in slight tension ($2.5\sigma$) with the data when compared to a fit that allows for 50\% SU(3)$_F$ breaking, the latter giving a perfect description of the data. In order to allow for further scrutinization of SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects in the future, we give branching ratio predictions for all $D\rightarrow P\eta'$ modes. Our predictions deviate from the current data in case of the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\rightarrow K^+\eta^\prime)$ and $\mathcal{B}(D^+\rightarrow K^+\eta')$. Future more precise measurements of these channels are therefore highly important in order to clarify the quality of the SU(3)$_F$ expansion in nonleptonic $D\rightarrow P\eta^\prime$ decays.</description>

      <title>Hadron production in the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charged current weak interaction can distinguish quark flavors, it provides a valid method to determine (transverse momentum dependent) parton distribution functions in high energy reactions by utilizing tagged hadrons. In this paper, we calculate the charged current semi-inclusive deeply inelastic neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering of $N=Z$ nuclei. Semi-inclusive means that a spin-1 hadron is also measured in addition to the scattered charged lepton. The target nucleus has the same number of neutrons and protons and is assumed as unpolarized. According to calculations, we find that only chiral-even terms survive and chiral-odd terms vanish in the differential cross section for this charged current deeply inelastic (anti-)neutrino nucleus scattering process. Furthermore, we introduce a measurable quantity, the yield asymmetry of the produced hadron $A^h$, to determine the nuclear parton distribution functions. Numerical estimates show that the yield asymmetry is independent of the type of target nucleus if it has the same number of neutrons and protons. Numerical estimates also show that sea quark distribution functions and disfavored fragmentation functions have significant influence on measurable quantities.</description>

      <title>Detecting dilute axion stars constrained by fast radio bursts in the Solar System via stimulated decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be explained by collapsing axion stars, imposing constraints on the axion parameter space and providing valuable guidance for experimental axion searches. In the traditional post-inflationary model, axion stars could constitute up to $75\%$ of the dark matter component, suggesting that some axion stars may exist within the Solar System. Photons with energy half the axion mass can stimulate axion decay. Thus, directing a powerful radio beam at an axion star could trigger its stimulated decay, producing a detectable echo. Using this method, we find it is possible to test the existence of dilute axion stars with maximum masses ranging from $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$, as constrained by FRBs, within the Solar System. The resulting echo from axion stars constrained by FRBs could be detectable by terrestrial telescopes. Detecting such an echo would confirm the existence of axion stars, unravel the mystery of dark matter, and provide key evidence that some FRBs originate from collapsing axion stars. Furthermore, FRBs produced by axion star collapses could serve as standard candles, aiding in the resolution of the Hubble tension. If no echo is detected using this method, it would place constraints on the abundance of dark matter in the form of dilute axion stars with maximum masses in the range of $6.21\times10^{-12}M_\odot$ to $2.61\times10^{-10}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Metastability from Axion-Higgs Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-organised criticality, realised through cosmological dynamics in the early universe, is an alternative paradigm for addressing the electroweak hierarchy problem. In this scenario, an unnaturally light Higgs boson is the result of dynamics driving the electroweak vacuum towards a near-critical metastable point where the Higgs mass is bounded from above by the vacuum instability scale. To lower the vacuum instability scale close to the weak scale, previous realisations of this mechanism introduced new vector-like fermions coupled to the Higgs. Here we show that an Axion-Like Particle (ALP) coupling to the Higgs is an alternative possibility for achieving criticality with another well-motivated and naturally light candidate for new physics, thus leading to an entirely different set of testable phenomenological signatures. Our Axion-Higgs criticality model predicts an ALP in the MeV to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV range. The entire natural region of parameter space can be thoroughly explored by a combination of future colliders, flavour experiments, and cosmological observatories.</description>

      <title>Non-$D\bar{D}$ Decays into Light Meson Pairs of the $D$-Wave Charmonium $\psi_3(3842)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a $D$-wave partner of $\psi(3770)$ identified by the LHCb Collaboration, $\psi_3(3842)$ lies between the $D\bar{D}$ and $D\bar{D^*}$ thresholds. Its non-$D\bar{D}$ decay channels have attracted considerable interest. In this study, we investigate these allowed non-$D\bar{D}$ decays of $\psi_3(3842)$ into $PP$, $PV$, and $VV$ final states using the hadronic loop mechanism, where $P$ and $V$ represent light pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Our results suggest that these non-$D\bar{D}$ decays of $\psi_3(3842)$ can be significant, with contributions primarily driven by hadronic loops. Notably, the $\rho\pi$ channel stands out as the main non-$D\bar{D}$ decay mode, while non-$D\bar{D}$ decay channels involving strange mesons are also sizable. These predictions could be tested in future experiments such as those at LHCb and BESIII.</description>

      <title>NNLOCAL: completely local subtractions for color-singlet production in hadron collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NNLOCAL, a proof-of-concept parton-level Monte Carlo program implementing the extension of the completely local subtraction scheme CoLoRFulNNLO to the case of color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We have built general local subtraction terms that regularize all single and double unresolved infrared singularities in real radiation phase space. The subtractions are then integrated fully analytically to the required order in the parameter of dimensional regularization. Combining the integrated counterterms with the virtual contributions we demonstrate the cancellation of all infrared poles explicitly. We validate our procedure by computing the fully differential cross section for the production of a Higgs boson at the LHC in an effective field theory with gluons only. Our code provides the first public implementation of a completely local analytic subtraction scheme at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Footprint in fitting $B \to D$ vector form factor and determination for $D$-meson leading-twist LCDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we fit the $B\to D$ vector transition form factor (TFF) by using the data measured by \textsl{BABAR} and Belle Collaborations within Monte Carlo (MC) method. Meanwhile, the $B\to D$ TFF is also calculated by using the QCD light-cone sum rules approach (LCSRs) within right-handed chiral current correlation function. In the TFF, $D$-meson leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) is the most important non-perturbative input parameter, the precise behavior of which is mainly determined by the parameter $B_{2;D}$ in the light-cone harmonic oscillator model. Through fitting the TFF, we determine the value $B_{2;D}=0.445$. Then, we present the curve of $D$-meson leading-twist LCDA in comparison with other theoretical approaches. Subsequently, the $B\to D$ TFF $f_{+}^{BD}(q^2)$ at the large recoil region is $f_{+}^{BD}(0)=0.648_{-0.063}^{+0.067}$, which is compared in detail with theoretical estimates and experimental measurements. Furthermore, we calculated the decay width and branching fractions of the Cabibbo-favored semileptonic decays $B\to D\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$, which lead to the results $\mathcal{B}(B^0\to D^-\ell ^+\nu _{\ell}) =(2.10_{-0.38}^{+0.44})\times 10^{-2}$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to \bar{D}^0\ell ^+\nu _{\ell}) =(2.26_{-0.41}^{+0.48})\times 10^{-2}$. Finally, we predict the CKM matrix element with two scenarios $|V_{cb}|_{\rm SR}=41.55_{-4.50}^{+4.91}\times 10^{-3}$ and $|V_{cb} |_{\rm MC}=41.47_{-2.66}^{+2.55 }\times 10^{-3}$ from $B^0\to D^-\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$, $|V_{cb}|_{\rm SR}=40.54_{-3.80}^{+4.33}\times 10^{-3}$ and $|V_{cb} |_{\rm MC}=40.46_{-1.38}^{+1.40}\times 10^{-3}$ from $B^+\to \bar{D}^0\ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ which are in good agreement with theoretical and experimental predictions.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of singly heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with heavy-quark dominance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rigorous calculation of the spin-orbit terms in the three-quark system is realized based on the Gaussian expansion method and the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions in the frame work of the relativized quark model, by ignoring the mixing between different excited states. Then, the complete mass spectra of the singly heavy baryons are obtained rigorously, under the mechanism of the heavy-quark dominance. On these bases, the systematical analyses are carried out for the reliability and predictive power of the model, the fine structure of the singly heavy baryon spectra, the assignments of the excited baryons, and some important topics about the heavy baryon spectroscopy such as the missing states, the `spin-orbit puzzle', the clustering effect, etc. The result confirms that under the heavy-quark dominance mechanism, the relativized quark model can describe the excitation spectra and the fine structures of the singly heavy baryons correctly and precisely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A precise evaluation of the electroweak contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon requires control over all aspects of the Standard Model, ranging from Higgs physics, over multi-loop computations for bosonic and (heavy-)fermion diagrams, to non-perturbative effects in the presence of light quarks. Currently, the dominant uncertainties arise from such hadronic effects in the vector-vector-axial-vector three-point function, an improved understanding of which has recently emerged in the context of hadronic light-by-light scattering. Profiting from these developments as well as new perturbative and non-perturbative input for the charm contribution, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{EW}=154.4(4)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Can we determine the exact size of the nucleon?: A comprehensive study of different radii</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of nucleon radii plays a central role in our understanding of the internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing critical insights into the non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While the charge radius is often interpreted as the ``size" of the nucleon, this interpretation is an oversimplification that overlooks the multifaceted nature of nucleon structure. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different nucleon radii, including the charge and magnetic radii, the axial radius, and the emerging concepts of mechanical and mass radii. We discuss the definitions as well as the experimental, theoretical and phenomenological determinations of these radii, highlighting their distinct physical origins and implications. By synthesizing recent experimental results and theoretical advancements, we emphasize that each radius reflects a specific aspect of the nucleon's internal structure, such as its electric charge distribution, magnetic properties, weak interactions, or internal mechanical stress. In particular, we address the common but misleading interpretation of the proton radius as a simple measure of its size, underscoring the nuanced and context-dependent nature of nucleon radii. Through this exploration, we aim to clarify the roles of these radii in characterizing nucleon structure and to identify open questions that remain to be addressed. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the nucleon and its significance in the broader context of particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Reappraisal of rho meson in nuclear matter by inverse QCD sum rules method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive reappraisal of the in-medium properties of the rho meson using the inverse QCD sum rules (QCDSR) formalism, offering a novel, model-independent approach to studying hadronic modifications in nuclear matter. Unlike conventional QCDSR, which rely on a predefined pole+continuum structure, the inverse method reconstructs the spectral function directly from the operator product expansion (OPE), eliminating assumptions about the spectral ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the inverse QCDSR method to the rho meson in nuclear matter. Our analysis reveals a significant reduction in the rho meson mass, consistent with previous theoretical predictions, and highlights the crucial role of medium-induced modifications, including condensate suppression and factorization-breaking effects. Furthermore, we assess the sensitivity of our results to the factorization assumption and higher-dimensional condensates, demonstrating the necessity of refining nonperturbative contributions for an accurate description of in-medium hadron properties. Our findings establish the inverse QCDSR method as a robust alternative to conventional spectral analysis techniques, providing a systematically controlled framework for exploring strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These results offer important theoretical benchmarks for lattice QCD simulations and heavy-ion collision experiments, shedding light on the restoration of chiral symmetry and the evolution of hadronic matter in dense environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-loop planar contributions to a three-body form factor at the next-to-leading power in the high-energy limit, where the masses of external particles are much smaller than their energies. The calculation is performed by exploiting the differential equations of the expansion coefficients, both for facilitating the linear relations among them, and for deriving their analytic expressions. The result is written in terms of generalized polylogarithms involving a few simple symbol letters. Our method can be readily applied to the calculation of non-planar contributions as well. The result provides crucial information for establishing sub-leading factorization theorems for massive scattering amplitudes in the high-energy limit.</description>

      <title>Probing Pion Valence Quark Distribution with Beam-charge Asymmetry of Pion-induced $J/\psi$ Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the beam-charge asymmetry of the $J/\psi$ production cross sections in $\pi^-$- versus $\pi^+$-induced reactions on proton or nuclear targets. We show that the $J/\psi$ production cross section difference between $\pi^-$ and $\pi^+$ beams impinging on a proton target has a positive sign with a magnitude proportional to the product of pion's valence quark distribution, $V_\pi$, and proton's up and down valence quark distribution difference, $u^V - d^V$. The existing $J/\psi$ production data for $\pi^- + p$ and $\pi^+ + p$ at 39.5 and 200 GeV/c are consistent with the expected positive beam-charge asymmetry. The magnitude of the asymmetry is compared with calculations performed within two theoretical frameworks, the Color Evaporation Model (CEM) and the Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) formalism. We also examine the beam-charge dependence for pion-induced $J/\psi$ production cross sections measured on the neutron-rich platinum target, and find good agreement between the data and theory for both the negative sign and the magnitude of the beam-charge asymmetry. The comparison between data and theoretical calculations for both proton and platinum targets suggests that the beam-charge asymmetry in pion-induced $J/\psi$ production is a viable method of accessing the valence quark distribution of the pion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Refs. [1,2] we provided a complete dispersive evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While the evaluation strategy was developed for the kinematic situation determined by the muon mass, a similar approach also applies to the HLbL corrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and $\tau$ lepton, shifting the sensitivity in the loop integrals to smaller and larger momenta, respectively. In this Letter, we propagate the corresponding uncertainties of the various contributions, obtaining $a_e^\text{HLbL}= 3.51(23)\times 10^{-14}$ and $a_\tau^\text{HLbL}= 3.77(29)\times 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine hadron multiplicity fluctuations in hard processes and confront analytic QCD predictions with the pattern of multiplicity fluctuations observed in $e^+e^-$ annihilation and high-$p_t$ jets produced in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. Special emphasis is placed on high-multiplicity fluctuations in jets. Selecting events with hadronic multiplicity exceeding the average value by a factor of 3 or more in various processes has been a source of conundrums for many years. We discuss two recent high-multiplicity puzzles and attempt to reveal their common origin.</description>

      <title>Calculations of Di-Hadron Production via Two-Photon Processes in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon processes in relativistic heavy-ion collisions have emerged as a critical probe of quantum electrodynamics in ultra-intense electromagnetic fields, with recent focus extending beyond dileptons to hadronic final states. At present, quantitative studies of di-hadron production via two-photon interactions remain scarce. In this work, we employ the Equivalent Photon Approximation to obtain differential cross-section predictions for pi+pi-, K+K-, and p pbar pairs produced in ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV within the STAR acceptance. The calculations deliver the unified baseline for light-meson and baryon pairs in this environment, supplying benchmarks for upcoming STAR measurements and guiding future systematic investigations of hadronic two-photon processes at RHIC and LHC facilities.</description>

      <title>Local equilibrium Wigner function for spin-1/2 particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal connections between the spin density matrix and the Wigner function for spin-1/2 particles forming a relativistic gas are explored to determine their general structures. They suggest that the commonly used form of the local equilibrium Wigner function should be replaced by a new expression. The latter fulfills the necessary condition for the normalization of the mean spin polarization, which the former fails to reproduce. The applicability of the new form is determined and found to comprise the range of hydrodynamic parameters used in current models of heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, the new definition of the Wigner function leads to the generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics, which were obtained earlier in the approach using the classical concept of spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of Dark Matter must contend with the fact that the presence of electroweak symmetry breaking along the thermal evolution of the Universe modifies the masses, interactions and, thus, the thermally averaged cross sections. We study in detail the impact of taking (not taking) the presence of the electroweak symmetry breaking into account in the calculations of the Dark Matter relic density, providing a model-independent measure of such differences. By focusing on a particular model, we show that ignoring this effect can lead to the inclusion (exclusion) of wrong (viable) regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.04911 \pm 0.00084$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001~159~652~183~56(76)$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-driven likelihood-free parameter inference for 21-cm forest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hyperfine structure absorption lines of neutral hydrogen in spectra of high-redshift radio sources, known collectively as the 21-cm forest, have been demonstrated as a sensitive probe to the small-scale structures governed by the dark matter (DM) properties, as well as the thermal history of the intergalactic medium regulated by the first galaxies during the epoch of reionization. By statistically analyzing these spectral features, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can effectively break the parameter degeneracies and constrain the properties of both DM and the first galaxies. However, conventional parameter inference methods face challenges due to computationally expensive simulations for 21-cm forest and the non-Gaussian signal characteristics. To address these issues, we introduce generative normalizing flows for data augmentation and inference normalizing flows for parameters estimation. This approach efficiently estimates parameters from minimally simulated datasets with non-Gaussian signals. Using simulated data from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), we demonstrate the ability of the deep learning-driven likelihood-free approach to generate accurate posterior distributions, providing a robust and efficient tool for probing DM and the cosmic heating history using the 1D power spectrum of 21-cm forest in the era of SKA. This methodology is adaptable for scientific analyses with other unevenly distributed data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that the null energy condition is not violated. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants: from measurement to the universe, a window on gravitation and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental constants are a cornerstone of the physical laws. Any constant varying in space and/or time would signal a violation of local position invariance and be associated with a violation of the universality of free fall, and hence of the weak equivalence principle. It will reflect the existence of new degrees of freedom that couple to standard matter. Thus, testing for the stability of fundamental constants is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and for characterizing the domain of validity of General Relativity. Besides, it opens an independent window on dark matter and dark energy.
  As a consequence, thanks to the active development of experiments and of their accuracy, fundamental constants have become a key player in our search for physics beyond the standard model of and beyond General Relativity.
  This review details the roles of the fundamental constants in the laws of physics and in the construction of the International System of units. Then, the relations between constants, tests of the local position invariance and of the universality of free fall are exposed, as well as the construction of field theories that account for "varying constants". Then, the main experimental and observational constraints are described. It details the basics of each system, its dependence with respect to the primary parameters the variation of which can be constrained from observations, the known systematics effects and the most recent constraints. It also describes how these primary parameters can be related to the fundamental constants and the model-dependencies. Both time and space variation are considered. Given the huge increase of data and constraints, a general scheme to present experimental and observational results and to construct a collaborative data base that will be more efficient for the community and allow for better traceability, is proposed.</description>

      <title>Thin-wall vacuum decay in the presence of a compact dimension meets the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proposal of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant in the late universe, mirroring a transition from anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) space, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a compelling framework for ameliorating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. An attractive theoretical realisation that accommodates the AdS $\to$ dS transition relies on the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk of a 5-dimensional (5-dim) set up. Among the fields characterising the dark sector, there is a real scalar field $\phi$ endowed with a potential holding two local minima with very small difference in vacuum energy and bigger curvature (mass) of the lower one. Shortly after the false vacuum tunnels to its true vacuum state, $\phi$ becomes more massive and its contribution to the Casimir energy becomes exponentially suppressed. The tunneling process then changes the difference between the total number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom contributing to the quantum corrections of the vacuum energy, yielding the AdS $\to$ dS transition. We investigate the properties of this theoretical realisation to validate its main hypothesis and characterise free parameters of the model. We adopt the Coleman-de Luccia formalism for calculating the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation. We show that the Euclidean bounce configuration that drives the transition between $\phi$ vacua has associated at least a sixth order potential. We also show that distinctive features of the required vacuum decay to accommodate the AdS $\to$ dS transition are inconsistent with a 5-dim non-compact description of the instanton, for which the bounce is $O(5)$ symmetric, and instead call for a 5-dim instanton with a compact dimension, for which the bounce is $O(4)\times U(1)$ symmetric.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic field and chemical potential induced anisotropy and frame dependent chaos of a $Q\bar{Q}$ pair in holographic QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. We find signatures of chaos in energetically disfavored string configurations, that are closer to the horizon, whereas no chaos is observed in energetically favored string configurations that are away from the horizon. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. The reported Lyapunov exponents are consistent with a classical analogue of the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and we find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation, and found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation between the squeezed limit of the bispectrum and the square of the power spectrum. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs which is the finiteness of the relevant observables in these limits, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the paraxial beam model in the study of quantum vacuum signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of nonlinear quantum vacuum signals often model the driving laser fields as paraxial beams. This in particular holds for analytic approaches. While this allows for reliable predictions in most situations, there are also notable exceptions. A prominent example is the overestimation of the polarization-flipped signal photon yield in the collision of two equally focused, parallel polarized laser beams by a factor of about six. In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the example of two linearly polarized laser pulses colliding at a generic collision angle.</description>

      <title>Scalar Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper it is initiated the systematic study of thermal field theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. The focus here is on scalar fields, although some results also apply to fields with arbitrary spins. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Moreover, path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. It is shown that, while the average angular momentum, like the chemical potentials, does not contribute positively to the Euclidean action, its negative contributions can be compensated by some other contributions that are instead positive, at least in some cases. As an application of the developed general formalism, it is shown that the production of particles weakly coupled to a rotating plasma can be significantly enhanced compared to the non-rotating case. The Higgs boson production through a portal coupling to a dark sector in the early universe is studied in some detail. The findings of this paper can also be useful, for example, to investigate the physics of rotating stars, ordinary and primordial black holes and more exotic compact objects.</description>

Abstract: We use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong gravitational lensing (SGL) system RXJ1131-1231 and constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$) via the distance sum rule, without assuming a specific cosmological model. For $\Omega_K = 0$, we obtain $H_0 = 73.22^{+5.95}_{-5.43}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 70.40^{+8.03}_{-5.60}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ by breaking the mass-sheet transform using lens galaxy's mass models and stellar kinematics, respectively. Allowing $\Omega_K$ to vary increases the central value of $H_0$ and reduces its precision. We find that GW dark sirens have significant potential for calibrating SGL systems, due to their relatively higher redshifts. By combining 42 binary black holes and RXJ1131-1231, we obtain an $H_0$ constraint with a precision approximately $40\%$ better than the measurement from GW170817 using the Hubble law. This suggests that high-precision, model-independent $H_0$ measurements can be achieved with this method as the redshift range of GW dark sirens expands, even without the need for GW bright sirens.</description>

      <title>Elliptic leading singularities and canonical integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the well-studied genus zero case, bases of $\mathrm{d}\log$ integrands with integer leading singularities define Feynman integrals that automatically satisfy differential equations in canonical form. Such integrand bases can be constructed without input from the differential equations and without explicit involvement of dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$. We propose a generalization of this construction to genus one geometry arising from the appearance of elliptic curves. We argue that a particular choice of algebraic one-forms of the second kind that avoids derivatives is crucial. We observe that the corresponding Feynman integrals satisfy a special form of differential equations that has not been previously reported, and that their solutions order by order in $\epsilon$ yield pure functions. We conjecture that our integrand-level construction universally leads to such differential equations.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole sourced by a generalized string fluid in the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with a generalized string fluid background. Our analysis reveals that zero-tidal solutions meet all geometric criteria for traversability while avoiding singularities, with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ modulating the throat geometry and asymptotic behavior. Varying the parameters $\alpha$ and $\varepsilon$ significantly affects curvature both near the throat and at large distances, maintaining finite values throughout spacetime. We demonstrate that the null energy condition (NEC) can be satisfied for high values of $\alpha$ ($\gtrsim 1$) and low string fluid density $\varepsilon$ ($\lesssim 0.1$), greatly reducing the exotic matter requirement compared to general relativistic wormholes. The string fluid's behavior approaches that of a cloud of strings for large $\alpha$ or $\varepsilon$. Additionally, the volume integral quantifier and complexity factor analyses show that increasing $\alpha$ reduces gravitational complexity and exotic matter content near the throat, aligning with NEC preservation. Our results establish that the combined influence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity and string-like matter can support traversable wormholes while minimizing unphysical energy conditions, offering new insights for constructing viable wormhole geometries in modified gravity.</description>
