      <title>Long-rising Type II supernovae resembling supernova 1987A - II. A new analytical model to describe these events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of improving our knowledge on supernova (SN) 1987A-like objects and, more in general, on H-rich SNe, we have developed a new analytic model to describe their post-explosive evolution. The distinctive features of this model are the possibility to evaluate the emitted luminosity and the SN expansion velocity, taking into account the recombination of the ejected material, the heating effects due to the \chem{56}{Ni} decay in the computation of the recombination front position, and the presence of an outer thin shell not-homologously expanding. In this paper, we present the model and a comparison with observations of SN 1987A, showing that its bolometric light curve and expansion velocity are accurately reproduced by the model. We also investigate the modeling degeneration problem in H-rich SNe and the possibility to ``standardize'' the subgroup of SN 1987A-like objects. Moreover we present new Ni-dependent relationships, based on our model, which link some features of the bolometric light curve of 1987A-like SNe (namely, the peak luminosity and its width) with the main physical properties of their progenitor at the explosion (i.e.~the ejected mass, the explosion energy, the progenitor radius at the explosion, and the amount of \chem{56}{Ni} present in the ejecta), showing that such relations are in excellent agreement with observations of real SNe. From our model, we also deduce new scaling relations which may be used for estimating the main SN progenitor's physical properties at the explosion, once only the photometric behaviour of the SN 1987A-like object is known.</description>

      <title>Swift-XRT and NuSTAR Monitoring of Obscuration Variability in Mrk 477</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of 15 X-ray observations of Mrk 477, a nearby Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus, with the objective to monitor its obscuring column density variability. The full dataset consists of five archival observations, split into two XMM-Newton, two NuSTAR and one Chandra observation, plus two dedicated monitoring campaigns. The monitoring campaigns were performed with Swift-XRT and NuSTAR, containing five observations each. We performed a simultaneous analysis using self-consistent torus models, deriving geometric properties of the torus as well as the obscuration along the line of sight. Mrk 477 is best modeled with a torus with large covering factor yet low column density (on average). Its line of sight column density oscillates between $1.5-7\times10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$. Mrk~477 presents frequent obscuring column density variability, on timescales as short as $\sim2$~weeks. The probability of drawing a pair of obscuration-variable observations for Mrk~477 when having 2, 3, and 4 observations is 40\%, 78\% and 95\%, respectively. Adding the results of this work to those of another 26 sources, we find a trend of increasing obscuration variability with time (from $\sim20$\% at $\Delta t&lt;10$~days, to $\sim60-70$\% at timescales larger than 5 years). We discuss whether this is compatible with the majority of obscuration variability coming from broad line region clouds.</description>

      <title>Probing solar modulation of AMS-02 time-dependent D, $^3$He and $^4$He fluxes with modified force field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AMS-02 experiment recently published time-dependent fluxes of deuterons (D) from May 2011 to April 2021, divided into 33 periods of four Bartels rotations each. These temporal structures are associated with solar modulation. In this study, three modified force-field approximation are employed to examine the long-term behavior of cosmic-ray (CR) isotopes such as deuteron, $^3$He, and $^4$He, as well as the ratios D/$^3$He and $^3$He/$^4$He. The solar modulation potential is rigidity-dependent for these modified force-field approximation. Due to the unknown local interstellar spectrum (LIS) for these isotopes, we utilize the Non-LIS method for solar modulation. By fitting to the AMS-02 time-dependent fluxes, we derive the solar modulation parameters. Our findings indicate that all isotopes can be fitted using the same parameters. Thus, the time-independent behavior of the flux ratio at low energy primarily arises from differences in the LIS and the conversion between kinetic energy and rigidity for cosmic rays with varying Z/A ratios. Based on these, we forecast the daily fluxes of D, $^3$He and $^4$He.</description>

      <title>Linking Analytic Light Curve Models to Physical Properties of Kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary neutron star mergers, lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta and lanthanide-poor post-merger ejecta have been often linked to the red and blue kilonova emission, respectively. However, analytic light curve modeling of kilonova often results in the ejecta parameters that are at odds with such expectations. To investigate the physical meaning of the derived parameters, we perform analytic modeling of the kilonova light curves calculated with realistic multi-dimensional radiative transfer based on the numerical relativity simulations. Our fiducial simulations adopt a faster-moving, less massive dynamical ejecta and slower-moving, more massive post-merger ejecta. The results of analytic modeling, however, show that the inferred ''red'' component is more massive and slower, while the ''blue'' component is less massive and faster, as also inferred for GW170817/AT2017gfo. This suggests that the parameters derived from light curve modeling with an analytic model do not represent the true configuration of the kilonova ejecta. We demonstrate that the post-merger ejecta contributes to both blue and red emissions: the emission from the post-merger ejecta is absorbed and reprocessed to red emission by the dynamical ejecta with a higher lanthanide fraction. Our results caution against separately discussing the origins of red and blue components derived from the analytic models. Despite of the challenges in the parameter estimation, we show that the estimate of the total ejecta mass is rather robust within a factor of a few, reflecting the total luminosity output. To derive the reliable total ejecta mass, multi-epoch observations in near-infrared wavelengths near their light curve peaks are important.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous optical-radio observations of a fast radio burst in a close galaxy pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the MeerKAT discovery and MeerLICHT contemporaneous optical observations of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 20230808F, which was found to have a dispersion measure of $\mathrm{DM}=653.2\pm0.4\mathrm{\,pc\,cm^{-3}}$. FRB 20230808F has a scattering timescale $\tau_{s}=3.1\pm0.1\,\mathrm{ms}$ at $1563.6$ MHz, a rotation measure $\mathrm{RM}=169.4\pm0.2\,\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$, and a radio fluence $F_{\mathrm{radio}}=1.72\pm0.01\,\mathrm{Jy\,ms}$. We find no optical counterpart in the time immediately after the FRB, nor in the three months after the FRB during which we continued to monitor the field of the FRB. We set an optical upper flux limit in MeerLICHT's $q$-band of $11.7\,\mathrm{\mu Jy}$ for a 60 s exposure which started $\sim3.4$ s after the burst, which corresponds to an optical fluence, $F_{\mathrm{opt}}$, of $0.039\,\mathrm{Jy\,ms}$ on a timescale of $\sim3.4$ s. We obtain an estimate for the $q-$band luminosity limit of $vL_{v}\sim 1.3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. We localise the burst to a close galaxy pair at a redshift of $z_{\mathrm{spec}}=0.3472\pm0.0002$. Our time delay of $\sim3.4$ s between the FRB arrival time and the start of our optical exposure is the shortest ever for an as yet non-repeating FRB, and hence the closest to simultaneous optical follow-up that exists for such an FRB.</description>

      <title>A new pulsating neutron star in the Ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 4559 X7?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) are extragalactic objects with X-ray luminosities above the Eddington limit for a 10 Msun black hole (BH). ULXs may host super-Eddington accreting neutron stars or stellar mass BH, although the exact proportion of the two populations is not yet known. We investigate the properties of the ULX NGC 4559 X7, which shows flux variability up to a factor of 5 on months-to-years and hours-to-days timescales. A flaring activity was also observed during the source highest flux epochs. Flares are unpredictable, with different durations and all flat-topped in flux. The latter suggests that, at the flare peaks, there is likely a common switch-off mechanism for the accretion onto the compact object. We analysed all the available XMM-Newton and Swift/XRT observations to investigate the spectral and temporal evolution of X7, looking for short and long-term variability. We look for long-term periodicities and for coherent signals through accelerated searches that included orbital corrections. We described the X7 spectra with two thermal components plus a cut-off powerlaw model. We found three well defined spectral states, where the spectral variability is mainly driven by the two harder components. In addition, a pulsed signal at 2.6-2.7s was detected in two XMM-Newton observations. The significance of these coherent signals is relatively weak but they are found in two different observations with the same parameter space for the orbital properties. If confirmed, it would imply a high spin-down of 1e-9 s/s, which could be extreme amongst the known pulsating ULXs. X7 would become a new extragalactic ULX pulsar. We discuss the spectral and temporal results of X7 in the context of super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-mass compact object, in particular suggesting that the source might likely host a neutron star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we have proposed Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) boundary conditions at the normal shock front, which is passing through the condensed material. These RH conditions are quite general, and their convenient forms for the particle velocity, mass density, pressure, and temperature have been presented in terms of the upstream Mach number and the material parameters for the weak and the strong shocks, respectively. Finally, the effects on the mechanical quantities of the shock-compressed materials, e.g., titanium Ti6Al4V, stainless steel 304, aluminum 6061-T6, etc., have been discussed.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Improved SN Ia colors through expanded dimensionality with SALT3+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are a key probe in modern cosmology, as they can be used to measure luminosity distances at gigaparsec scales. Models of their light-curves are used to project heterogeneous observed data onto a common basis for analysis. The SALT model currently used for SN Ia cosmology describes SNe as having two sources of variability, accounted for by a color parameter c, and a "stretch parameter" x1. We extend the model to include an additional parameter we label x2, to investigate the cosmological impact of currently unaddressed light-curve variability. We construct a new SALT model, which we dub "SALT3+". This model was trained by an improved version of the SALTshaker code, using training data combining a selection of the second data release of cosmological SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the existing SALT3 training compilation. We find additional, coherent variability in supernova light-curves beyond SALT3. Most of this variation can be described as phase-dependent variation in g-r and r-i color curves, correlated with a boost in the height of the secondary maximum in i-band. These behaviors correlate with spectral differences, particularly in line velocity. We find that fits with the existing SALT3 model tend to address this excess variation with the color parameter, leading to less informative measurements of supernova color. We find that neglecting the new parameter in light-curve fits leads to a trend in Hubble residuals with x2 of 0.039 +/- 0.005 mag, representing a potential systematic uncertainty. However, we find no evidence of a bias in current cosmological measurements. We conclude that extended SN Ia light-curve models promise mild improvement in the accuracy of color measurements, and corresponding cosmological precision. However, models with more parameters are unlikely to substantially affect current cosmological results.</description>

      <title>Extract cleaned Swift/UVOT UV grism spectra with uvotpy package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultraviolet/optical telescope (UVOT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory is capable of imaging with 7 lenticular filters and of taking slitless spectra with 2 grisms. Both image and grism data have been widely used to study gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and other ultraviolet/optical transients, and proved UVOT is a powerful instrument in time-domain astronomy. However, the second order contamination, for blue sources, strongly limits the red end of ultraviolet (UV) grism spectra. This, in turn, reduces the valid wavelength range to only about 33% of the total. However, to explore the broadband spectral energy distribution of GRBs at the early stage, a larger valid wavelength range is required. Hence based on the uvotpy package, we propose a method to remove the second order contamination from UV grism spectra (nominal mode) up to about 4000\AA, i.e., about 70% of the full wavelength range. The 1-sigma systematic uncertainty of this method is about 11.2%. In addition, if a source is red enough, the red end of the valid range could reach about 5000\AA. The source code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Spacetime curvature corrections for the Yukawa potential and its application for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spacetime curvature on the Yukawa potential, focusing on boson-boson interactions derived from the {\Phi^3} theory. Using the Bunch-Parker propagator expansion within Born's first approximation, we derive a Yukawa-like potential in a curved spacetime. We analyze the impact of the curvature on the propagator in momentum space, revealing modifications to the potential and showing that the corrections are determined by geometric quantities from Einstein's equations, like the Ricci scalar and tensor. We illustrate this using the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, highlighting the corrections' magnitude for specific parameters. Our results underscore the nuanced interplay between spacetime curvature and quantum interactions, providing insights into nucleon-nucleon systems in curved spacetimes or near strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Correlated spectro-polarimetric study along the Z track in XTE J1701-462 puts constraints on its coronal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02658</link>

Abstract: Context. In September 2022, the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 went into a new outburst. Aims. The objective of this work is to examine the evolution of the accretion geometry of XTE J1701-462 by studying the spectro-polarimetric properties along the Z track of this source. The simultaneous observations archived by the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) and the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) give us the opportunity. Methods. We present a comprehensive X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis of XTE J1701-462, using simultaneous observations from IXPE, Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR. For IXPE observations, two methods are employed to measure the polarization: a model-independent measurement with PCUBE and a model-dependent polarization-spectral analysis with XSPEC. The corresponding spectra from Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR are studied with two configurations that correspond to a slab-like corona and a spherical shell-like corona, respectively. Results. Significant polarization characteristics are detected in XTE J1701-462. The polarization degree shows a decreasing trend along the Z track, reducing from (4.84 $\pm$ 0.37)% to (3.76 $\pm$ 0.43)% on the horizontal branch and jumping to less than 1% on the normal branch. The simultaneous spectral analysis from Insight-HXMT and NuSTAR suggests that the evolution of the PD is closely linked to changes in the flux of the Comptonized component and its covering factor along the Z track, supporting a shrinking corona.</description>

      <title>Constraining the equation of state in neutron-star cores via the long-ringdown signal</title>

Abstract: Multimessenger signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are promising tools to infer the largely unknown properties of nuclear matter at densities that are presently inaccessible to laboratory experiments. The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by BNS merger remnants, in particular, have the potential of setting tight constraints on the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) that would complement those coming from the late inspiral, direct mass-radius measurements, or ab-initio dense-matter calculations. To explore this possibility, we perform a representative series of general-relativistic simulations of BNS systems with EOSs carefully constructed so as to cover comprehensively the high-density regime of the EOS space. From these simulations, we identify a novel and tight correlation between the ratio of the energy and angular-momentum losses in the late-time portion of the post-merger signal, i.e., the ``long ringdown'', and the properties of the EOS at the highest pressures and densities in neutron-star cores. When applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals, we find a significant reduction of the EOS uncertainty at densities several times the nuclear saturation density, where no direct constraints are currently available. Hence, the long ringdown has the potential of providing new and stringent constraints on the state of matter in neutron stars in general and, in particular, in their cores.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent models of AGN disks with radiation from embedded stellar-mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brightest steady sources of radiation in the universe, active galactic nuclei (AGN), are powered by gas accretion onto a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The large sizes and accretion rates implicated in AGN accretion disks are expected to lead to gravitational instability and fragmentation, effectively cutting off mass inflow to the SMBH. Radiative feedback from disk-embedded stars has been invoked to yield marginally stable, steady-state solutions in the outer disks. Here, we examine the consequences of this star formation with a semi-analytical model in which stellar-mass black hole (sBH) remnants in the disk provide an additional source of stabilizing radiative feedback. Assuming star formation seeds the embedded sBH population, we model the time-evolving feedback from both stars and the growing population of accreting sBHs. We find that in the outer disk, the luminosity of the sBHs quickly dominates that of their parent stars. However, because sBHs consume less gas than stars to stabilize the disk, the presence of the sBHs enhances the mass flux to the inner disk. As a result, star formation persists over the lifetime of the AGN, damped in the outer disk, but amplified in a narrow ring in the inner disk. Heating from the embedded sBHs significantly modifies the disk's temperature profile and hardens its spectral energy distribution, and direct emission from the sBHs adds a new hard X-ray component.</description>

      <title>Disclosing the catalog pulsars dominating the Galactic positron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic-ray flux of positrons is measured with high precision by the space-borne particle spectrometer AMS-02. The hypothesis that pulsars and their nebulae can significantly contribute to the excess of the AMS-02 positron flux has been consolidated after the observation of a $\gamma$-ray emission at GeV and TeV energies of a few degree size around a few sources, that provide indirect evidence that electron and positron pairs are accelerated to very high energies from these sources. By modeling the emission from pulsars in the ATNF catalog, we find that combinations of positron emission from cataloged pulsars and secondary production can fit the observed AMS-02 data. Our results show that a small number of nearby, middle-aged pulsars, particularly B1055-52, Geminga (J0633+1746), and Monogem (B0656+14), dominate the positron emission, contributing up to 80\% of the flux at energies above 100 GeV. From the fit to the data, we obtain a list of the most important sources for which we recommend multi-wavelength follow-up observations, particularly in the $\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands, to further constrain the injection and diffusion properties of positrons.</description>

      <title>The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the Universe, corresponding to a fraction of $f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10}$ at 90\% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically $f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}$. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least $\sim$$10\%$ of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.</description>

Abstract: We present a timing study of the gamma and X-ray observations and analysis of a sample of bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; i.e. GRB 180720B, GRB 181222B, GRB 211211A and GRB 220910A), including the very bright and long GRB 211211A (a.k.a. kilonova candidate). They have been detected and observed by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) installed on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on-board the Fermi mission. The early (T-T0=s) and high-energy (0.3-20 MeV) ASIM High Energy Detector (HED) and (150 keV-30 MeV) Fermi (BGO) light curves show well-defined peaks with a low quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency between 2.5-3.5 Hz that could be identified with the spin of the neutron star in the binary mergers (coinciding with the orbital frequency of the binary merger) originating these GRBs. These QPOs consist on the first detection of low-frequency QPOs (&lt;10 Hz) detected in magnetars so far. We also detect a strong QPO at 21.8-22 Hz in GRB 181222B together with its (less significant) harmonics. The low-frequency QPO would correspond to the signal of the orbiting neutron star (NS) previous to the final coalescence giving rise to the gravitational-wave (GW) signal.</description>

      <title>Revision of two-temperature magnetically arrested flows onto a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the radiative properties of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) two-temperature magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models in which electrons are heated by a magnetic turbulent cascade. We focus on studying the model emission, whose characteristics include variability in both total intensity and linear/circular polarizations as well as rotation measures at energies around the synchrotron emission peak in millimeter waves. We find that radiative properties of MAD models with turbulent electron heating are well converged with respect to the numerical grid resolution, which has not been demonstrated before. We compare radiation from two-temperature simulations with turbulent heating to single-temperature models with electron temperatures calculated based on commonly used $R~(\beta)$ prescription. We find that the self-consisitent two-temperature models with turbulent heating do not significantly outperform the $R~(\beta)$ models and, in practice, may be indistinguishable from the $R~(\beta)$ models. Accounting for physical effects such as radiative cooling and nonthermal electron distribution function makes a weak impact on properties of millimeter emission. Models are scaled to Sgr A*, an accreting black hole in the center of our galaxy, and compared to the most complete observational datasets. We point out the consistencies and inconsistencies between the MAD models and observations of this source and discuss future prospects for GRMHD simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Potential Galactic Origin of the Ultra-High-Energy Event KM3-230213A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM3NeT observatory detected the most energetic neutrino candidate ever observed, with an energy between 72 PeV and 2.6 EeV at the 90% confidence level. The observed neutrino is likely of cosmic origin. In this article, it is investigated if the neutrino could have been produced within the Milky Way. Considering the low fluxes of the Galactic diffuse emission at these energies, the lack of a nearby potential Galactic particle accelerator in the direction of the event and the difficulty to accelerate particles to such high energies in Galactic systems, we conclude that if the event is indeed cosmic, it is most likely of extragalactic origin.</description>

      <title>The main jet axis of the W49B supernova remnant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify an axis connecting two opposite `ears' in the supernova remnant W49B and morphological signatures of three arcs around this axis that we claim are sections of full circum-jet rings. Based on recent identifications of morphological signatures of jets in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), including ejecta-rich axes, we reexamine images of W49B and identify a heavy element-rich protrusion (ear) as a jet-inflated structure. We identify the opposite ear and a clump at its tip as the signature of the opposite jets. The line connecting the two clumps at the tips of the two opposite ears forms the main jet axis of W49B. We compare the three arcs around the main jet axis in W49B to the circum-jet rings of the jets in the Cygnus A galaxy and deduce that these arcs are sections of full circum-jet rings in W49B. In W49B, the jets are long gone, as in some planetary nebulae with circum-jet rings. Identifying the main jet axis is incompatible with a type Ia supernova. It leaves two possibilities: that jets exploded W49B as a CCSN, i.e., the jittering jets explosion mechanism where the pair of jets we identify is one of many that exploded the star, or that the explosion was a common envelope jet supernova with a thermonuclear outburst, i.e., both the pair of jets and thermonuclear outburst exploded the core of a red supergiant star as a pre-existing neutron star tidally destroyed it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10144v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model is constructed to predict the emission originating from axion-to-photon conversion in the strongly magnetized ultrarelativistic plasma of neutron stars. The acceleration and multiplicity of the charges are observed to shift the axion-induced spectral feature with respect to previous expectations. The frequency range of interest widens accordingly, and heavier dark matter axions may resonate in magnetospheric splits giving rise to detectable radio signals that could extend into the millimeter band. Ultimately, this work follows an affirmative answer to the question of whether neutron stars can give rise to any detectable high-frequency spectral feature that would allow us to probe axion dark matter of masses up to about a millielectronvolt. SGR 1745--2900 emerges as a particularly promising astrophysical laboratory for probing high-frequency axion dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00741v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can undergo significant growth through superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale and transforming black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between boson fields and fermions may lead to parametric production or Schwinger pair production of fermions, with efficiencies significantly exceeding those of perturbative decay processes. Additionally, the spatial gradients of scalar clouds and the electric components of vector clouds can accelerate fermions, resulting in observable fluxes. This study considers both Standard Model neutrinos and dark sector fermions, which could contribute to boosted dark matter. Energy loss due to fermion emissions can potentially quench the exponential growth of the cloud, leading to a saturated state. This dynamic provides a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, previously constrained by neutrino self-interaction considerations. In the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to accelerate fermions to TeV energies, producing fluxes that surpass those from atmospheric neutrinos near black holes. These fluxes open new avenues for observations through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection efforts focused on targeted black holes.</description>

      <title>Influence of effective nucleon mass on equation of state for supernova simulations and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the effective nucleon mass on the equation of state (EOS), which is constructed for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. The study introduces a new RMF parameter set, TM1m, which is a modification of the TM1e model with an adjusted effective mass, maintaining the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The TM1m model, with a larger effective mass ratio ($M^{\ast}/M \sim 0.8$) compared to the TM1e model ($M^{\ast}/M \sim 0.63$), is employed to construct a new EOS table, EOS5. This EOS table is designed to offer insights into the influence of the effective nucleon mass on the EOS within a relativistic framework, particularly above the saturation density. The results of EOS5 are compared with those obtained from other models, including both relativistic and nonrelativistic approaches. The properties of cold neutron stars, calculated using the TM1m model, are compatible with the existence of a $2\ M_\odot$ pulsar and the latest constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of a canonical $1.4\ M_\odot$ neutron star, derived from astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>

Abstract: The possibility of compact stars as hideouts for color-spin-locked (CSL) quark matter (QM) is investigated in both MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Within the framework of NJL model, the idea of absolutely stable quark matter and the existence of conventional pure quark star (QS) are not supported; in addition, there appears to be no stable hybrid configuration above $2M_\odot$ as the hideout for CSL QM. The stable configurations of massive strange quark stars could be reproduced in the MIT bag model with QCD corrections being taken into account; moreover, they could act as the hiding place for the CSL QM. An interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic (EM) superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the quark core with a critical strength, while in some special cases a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. The analysis on energetics and time scale suggests that this process could act as an inducement mechanism to power typical fast radio bursts, but as a single source of energy, it is unlikely to generate other EM emissions such as gamma-ray bursts and giant flares.</description>

      <title>Quantum Closures for Neutrino Moment Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method for calculating the transport of neutrino flavor in simulations is to use angular moments of the neutrino one-body reduced density matrix, i.e., `quantum moments'. As with any moment-based radiation transport method, a closure is needed if the infinite tower of moment evolution equations is truncated. We derive a general parameterization of a quantum closure and the limits the parameters must satisfy in order for the closure to be physical. We then derive from multi-angle calculations the evolution of the closure parameters in two test cases which we then progressively insert into a moment evolution code and show how the parameters affect the moment results until the full multi-angle results are reproduced. This parameterization paves the way to setting prescriptions for genuine quantum closures adapted to neutrino transport in a range of situations.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the magnetic field in the thick shell of Galactic bubbles with uniform initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bubbles and super-bubbles are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and influence their local magnetic field. Starting from the assumption that bubbles result from violent explosions that sweep matter away in a thick shell, we derive the analytical equations for the divergence-free, regular magnetic field in the shell. The explosion velocity field is assumed to be radial but not necessarily spherical, making it possible to model various-shaped bubbles. Assuming an explosion center, the magnetic field at the present time is fully determined by the initial uniform magnetic field, the present-time geometry of the bubble shell, and a radial vector field that encodes the explosion-induced displacement of matter, from its original location to its present-time location. We present the main characteristics of our magnetic-field model using a simple linear model for the radial displacements. Next, we use our analytical prescription, informed by a three-dimensional dust density map, to estimate the expected contribution of the shell of the Local Bubble, the super-bubbles in which the Sun resides, to the integrated Faraday rotation measures and synchrotron emission and compare these to full-sky observational data. We find that, while the contribution to the former is minimal, the contribution to the latter is very significant at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;45^\circ$. Our results underline the need to take the Local Bubble into account in large-scale Galactic magnetic field studies.</description>

      <title>The neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nova outburst can produce a large number of neutrinos, whether it is the nuclear reaction process during the explosion or the shock wave acceleration proton process. We study the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity of novae with CO white dwarf (WD) mass ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ with different accretion rates $\dot{M}$, core temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{C}})$, and mixing degrees. We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon luminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity. During the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the more massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not taken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=1\times10^{7}\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We also predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB). We estimate that the next T CrB outburst has a low-energy nuclear neutrino peak luminosity of $2.7\times10^{8}\ \rm L_{\nu,\odot}$ and a low-energy nuclear neutrino outburst duration of 88 days. In addition, we predict that the high-energy hadronic neutrino flux produced by T CrB nova can not be observed by the current-generation IceCube.</description>
