      <title>All-magnonic repeater based on bistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistability, a universal phenomenon found in diverse fields such as biology, chemistry, and physics, describes a scenario in which a system has two stable equilibrium states and resets to one of the two states. The ability to switch between these two states is the basis for a wide range of applications, particularly in memory and logic operations. Here, we present a universal approach to achieve bistable switching in magnonics, the field processing data using spin waves. As an exemplary application, we use magnonic bistability to experimentally demonstrate the still missing magnonic repeater. A pronounced bistable window is observed in a 1um wide magnonic conduit under an external rf drive characterized by two magnonic stable states defined as low and high spin-wave amplitudes. The switching between these two states is realized by another propagating spin wave sent into the rf driven region. This magnonic bistable switching is used to design the magnonic repeater, which receives the original decayed and distorted spin wave and regenerates a new spin wave with amplified amplitude and normalized phase. Our magnonic repeater is proposed to be installed at the inputs of each magnonic logic gate to overcome the spin-wave amplitude degradation and phase distortion during previous propagation and achieve integrated magnonic circuits or magnonic neuromorphic networks.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved measurement of acoustic density fluctuations using a phase-shifting Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-shifting interferometry is one of the optical measurement techniques that improves accuracy and resolution by incorporating a controlled phase shift into conventional optical interferometry. In this study, a four-step phase-shifting interferometer is developed to measure the spatio-temporal distribution of acoustic density oscillations of the gas next to a rigid plate. The experimental apparatus consists of a polarizing Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a polarization camera capable of capturing four polarization directions in one shot image and it is used to measure the magnitude and the phase of density fluctuations through a duct of rectangular cross-section connected to a loudspeaker. The results are compared with the well-established thermoacoustic theory describing the thermal coupling between acoustic oscillations and rigid boundaries, and the results show a very good agreement for various ratios of the (frequency-dependent) thermal boundary layer thickness to the plate spacing. This measurement technique could be advantageously employed to analyze more complex heat transfer processes involving the coupling of acoustic oscillations with rigid boundaries.</description>

      <title>Effect of annealing on the hot salt corrosion resistance of the fine-grained titanium alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr obtained via cold Rotary Swaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hot salt corrosion (HSC) test was performed on the fine-grained titanium alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr (Russian industrial alloy PT-7M). The ultrafine-grained (UFG) microstructure in the titanium alpha-alloy was formed via cold Rotary Swaging. The grain size and volume fraction of the recrystallized microstructure in the alloy were varied by choosing appropriate annealing temperatures and times. The microstructure and corrosion resistance of UFG alloys were studied after 30 min of annealing at 500-700C and after 1000 h of annealing at 250C. Metallographic studies were carried out to investigate the effects of annealing on the nature and extent of corrosive damage in the titanium alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr. After HSC tests, surface analyses of the titanium alpha-alloy samples were conducted using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. During the HSC testing of the titanium alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr, a competitive interaction between intergranular corrosion (IGC) and pitting corrosion was observed. To the best of our knowledge, it was shown for the first time that annealing affects the relationship among the IGC, pitting corrosion and uniform corrosion rates of the titanium alloy. Prolonged low-temperature annealing at 250C resulted in a more pronounced increase in the uniform corrosion rate than short-term high-temperature annealing for 30 min at 500-700C. An in-depth analysis of the effect of the structure and phase composition of the grain boundaries on the susceptibility of the alpha-alloy Ti-2.5Al-2.6Zr to HSC was conducted.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Transparent Electrodes: Interplay of High Purity SWCNTs network and a Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of transparent electrodes led to the development of optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs, LCDs, touchscreens, IR sensors, etc. Since ITO has many drawbacks in respect of its production cost and limited transparency in IR, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been a potential replacement for ITO due to their exceptional electrical and optical properties, especially in the IR region. In this work, we present the development of a CNT-polymer composite thin film that exhibits outstanding transparency across both visible and IR spectra prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. This approach not only ensures uniform integration and crosslinking of CNTs into lightweight matrices, but also represents a cost-effective method for producing transparent electrodes with remarkable optical and electrical properties. The produced films achieved a transparency above 80% in the UV-VIS range and approximately 70% in the mid-IR range. The sheet resistance of the fabricated thin films was measured at about 4 kOhm/sq, showing a tendency to decrease with the number of bilayers. Furthermore, in this work we have investigated electrical properties and transport mechanisms in more detail with computational analysis. Computational analysis was performed to better understand the electrical behavior of nanotube-polymer junctions in the interbundle structure. Based on all results, we propose that the transparent electrodes with 4 and 6 bilayers are the most optimal structures in terms of optical and electrical properties.</description>

      <title>The performance of microwave photonic signal processors based on microcombs with different input signal waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave photonic (MWP) signal processors, which process microwave signals based on pho-tonic technologies, bring advantages intrinsic to photonics such as low loss, large processing bandwidth, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. Optical microcombs can offer a large number of wavelength channels and compact device footprints, which make them powerful multi-wavelength sources for MWP signal processors to realize a variety of processing functions. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the capability of microcomb-based MWP signal processors to handle diverse input signal waveforms. In addition, we quantify the processing accuracy for different input signal waveforms, including Gaussian, triangle, parabolic, super Gaussian, and nearly square waveforms. Finally, we analyze the factors contributing to the dif-ference in the processing accuracy among the different input waveforms, and our theoretical analysis well elucidates the experimental results. These results provide a guidance for micro-comb-based MWP signal processors when processing microwave signals of various waveforms.</description>

      <title>Status of the Top Plate and Anticryostat for High Field Cable Test Facility at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) is currently constructing a new High Field Vertical Magnet Test Facility (HFVMTF) designed for testing High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cables under high magnetic fields. This facility is expected to offer capabilities similar to those of EDIPO at PSI and FRESCA2 at CERN. The background magnetic field of 15 T will be generated by a magnet supplied by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The primary function of HFVMTF will be to serve as a superconducting cable test facility, facilitating tests under high magnetic fields and a broad spectrum of cryogenic temperatures. Additionally, the facility will be utilized for testing highfield superconducting magnet models and demonstrators, including hybrid magnets, developed by the US Magnet Development Program (MDP). This paper provides a comprehensive description of the current status of two pivotal components of the facility: the Top/Lambda Plates Assembly and the Anticryostat for the Test Sample Holder. The latter will serve as a principal interface component connecting cable test samples with the facility's cryostat.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present two design generations of metasurface-based planar microlenses implemented on Front-Side Illumination SPAD pixels. This kind of microlens is an alternative to conventional reflow microlens. It offers more degrees of freedom in term of design, especially the capability to design off-axis microlens to gather light around the SPAD photodiode. The two generations of microlenses have been fabricated on STMicroelectronics SPAD and characterized. We validated the sensitivity improvement offered by extended metasurface-based microlens.

      <title>Influence of concentration-dependent material properties on the fracture and debonding of electrode particles with core-shell structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-shell electrode particle designs offer a route to improved lithium-ion battery performance. However, they are susceptible to mechanical damage such as fracture and debonding, which can significantly reduce their lifetime. Using a coupled finite element model, we explore the impacts of diffusion-induced stresses on the failure mechanisms of an exemplar system with an NMC811 core and an NMC111 shell. In particular, we systematically compare the implications of assuming constant material properties against using Li concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient and partial molar volume. With constant material properties, our results show that smaller cores with thinner shells avoid debonding and fracture regimes. When factoring in a concentration-dependent partial molar volume, the maximum values of tensile hoop stress in the shell are found to be significantly lower than those predicted with constant properties, reducing the likelihood of fracture. Furthermore, with a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, significant barriers to full electrode utilisation are observed due to reduced lithium mobility at high states of lithiation. This provides a possible explanation for the reduced accessible capacity observed in experiments. Shell thickness is found to be the dominant factor in precluding structural integrity once the concentration dependency is accounted for. These findings shed new light on the performance and effective design of core-shell electrode particles.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon super-linear image scanning microscopy using upconversion nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is of great interest in life science studies for visualizing subcellular structures at the nanometer scale. Among various kinds of super-resolution approaches, image scanning microscopy (ISM) offers a doubled resolution enhancement in a simple and straightforward manner, based on the commonly used confocal microscopes. ISM is also suitable to be integrated with multi-photon microscopy techniques, such as two-photon excitation and second-harmonic generation imaging, for deep tissue imaging, but it remains the twofold limited resolution enhancement and requires expensive femtosecond lasers. Here, we present and experimentally demonstrate the super-linear ISM (SL-ISM) to push the resolution enhancement beyond the factor of two, with a single low-power, continuous-wave, and near-infrared laser, by harnessing the emission nonlinearity within the multiphoton excitation process of lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). Based on a modified confocal microscope, we achieve a resolution of about 120 nm, 1/8th of the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, we demonstrate a parallel detection strategy of SL-ISM with the multifocal structured excitation pattern, to speed up the acquisition frame rate. This method suggests a new perspective for super-resolution imaging or sensing, multi-photon imaging, and deep-tissue imaging with simple, low-cost, and straightforward implementations.</description>

      <title>Effects of dislocation filtering layers on optical properties of third telecom window emitting InAs/InGaAlAs quantum dots grown on silicon substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating light emitters based on III-V materials with silicon-based electronics is crucial for further increase in data transfer rates in communication systems since the indirect bandgap of silicon prevents its direct use as a light source. We investigate here InAs/InGaAlAs quantum dot (QD) structures grown directly on 5{\deg} off-cut Si substrate and emitting light at 1.5 micrometers, compatible with established telecom platform. Using different dislocation defects filtering layers, exploiting strained superlattices and supplementary QD layers, we mitigate the effects of lattice constant and thermal expansion mismatches between III-V materials and Si during growth. Complementary optical spectroscopy techniques, i.e. photoreflectance and temperature-, time- and polarization- resolved photoluminescence, allow us to determine the optical quality and application potential of the obtained structures by comparing them to a reference sample -- state-of-the-art QDs grown on InP. Experimental findings are supported by calculations of excitonic states and optical transitions by combining multiband k.p and configuration-interaction methods. We show that our design of structures prevents the generation of a considerable density of defects, as intended. The emission of Si-based structures appears to be much broader than for the reference dots, due to the creation of different QD populations which might be a disadvantage in particular laser applications, however, could be favourable for others, e.g. in broadly tunable devices, sensors, or optical amplifiers. Eventually, we identify the overall most promising combination of defect filtering layers, discuss its advantages and limitations, and prospects for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Ionic Vortices: Voltage-Reconfigurable Swirling-Spin Analog-Memory Nanomagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in information technologies has spurred the need for innovative memory concepts, for which advanced data-processing methods and tailor-made materials are required. Here we introduce a previously unexplored nanoscale magnetic object: an analog magnetic vortex controlled by electric-field-induced ion motion, termed magneto-ionic vortex or "vortion". This state arises from paramagnetic FeCoN through voltage gating and gradual N3-ion extraction within patterned nanodots. Unlike traditional vortex states, vortions offer comprehensive analog adjustment of key properties such as magnetization amplitude, nucleation/annihilation fields, or coercivity using voltage as an energy-efficient tuning knob. This manipulation occurs post-synthesis, obviating the need for energy-demanding methods like laser pulses or spin-torque currents. By leveraging an overlooked aspect of N3-magneto-ionics -- planar ion migration within nanodots -- precise control of the magnetic layer's thickness is achieved, which enables reversible transitions among paramagnetic, single-domain, and vortion states, offering future prospects for analog computing, multi-state data storage, or brain-inspired devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a key ingredient for various two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructure devices, but the exact role of h-BN encapsulation in relation to the internal defects of 2D semiconductors remains unclear. Here, we report that h-BN encapsulation greatly removes the defect-related gap states by stabilizing the chemisorbed oxygen molecules onto the defects of monolayer WS2 crystals. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) combined with theoretical analysis clearly confirms that the oxygen molecules are chemisorbed onto the defects of WS2 crystals and are fixated by h-BN encapsulation, with excluding a possibility of oxygen molecules trapped in bubbles or wrinkles formed at the interface between WS2 and h-BN. Optical spectroscopic studies show that h-BN encapsulation prevents the desorption of oxygen molecules over various excitation and ambient conditions, resulting in a greatly lowered and stabilized free electron density in monolayer WS2 crystals. This suppresses the exciton annihilation processes by two orders of magnitude compared to that of bare WS2. Furthermore, the valley polarization becomes robust against the various excitation and ambient conditions in the h-BN encapsulated WS2 crystals.</description>

      <title>Universal Murray's law for optimised fluid transport in synthetic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials following Murray's law are of significant interest due to their unique porous structure and optimal mass transfer ability. However, it is challenging to construct such biomimetic hierarchical channels with perfectly cylindrical pores in synthetic systems following the existing theory. Achieving superior mass transport capacity revealed by Murray's law in nanostructured materials has thus far remained out of reach. We propose a Universal Murray's law applicable to a wide range of hierarchical structures, shapes and generalised transfer processes. We experimentally demonstrate optimal flow of various fluids in hierarchically planar and tubular graphene aerogel structures to validate the proposed law. By adjusting the macroscopic pores in such aerogel-based gas sensors, we also show a significantly improved sensor response dynamic. Our work provides a solid framework for designing synthetic Murray materials with arbitrarily shaped channels for superior mass transfer capabilities, with future implications in catalysis, sensing and energy applications.</description>

Abstract: As the condensed matter analog of Majorana fermion, the Majorana zero-mode is well known as a building block of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. This review focuses on the recent progress of Majorana experiments, especially experiments about semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices. We first sketch Majorana zero-mode formation from a bottom-up view, which is more suitable for beginners and experimentalists. Then, we survey the status of zero-energy state signatures reported recently, from zero-energy conductance peaks, the oscillations, the quantization, and the interactions with extra degrees of freedom. We also give prospects of future experiments for advancing one-dimensional semiconductor nanowire-superconductor hybrid materials and devices.</description>

Abstract: Terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) has emerged as a potent technique for probing ultrafast nanoscale dynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal precision, whereby the acquisition of THz near-field waveforms holds paramount significance. While substantial efforts have been dedicated to retrieving the waveform utilizing the photoemission current or a molecular sensor, these methods are challenged by intensive thermal effects or complex sample preparations. In this study, we introduce a universal approach for real-time characterization of THz near-field waveforms within the tunnel junction, achieving sub-nanometer spatial resolution. Utilizing the gating mechanism intrinsic to the STM junction, coherent scanning of a gated strong THz pulse over a weak THz pulse is achieved, facilitating direct measurement of the waveform. Notably, employing a custom-built Carrier-Envelope Phase (CEP) shifter, THz-CEP has been successfully characterized in the tunnel junction. Moreover, sub-nanometer spatial resolution of the THz-driven field emission current has been shown, underscoring the nanoscale resolving ability of our methodology. Ultimately, the potential application of this method for local THz time domain spectroscopy imaging has been demonstrated through point-to-point waveform sampling over the Au (111) surface.</description>
