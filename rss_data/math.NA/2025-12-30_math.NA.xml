      <title>Differentiable Inverse Modeling with Physics-Constrained Latent Diffusion for Heterogeneous Subsurface Parameter Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a latent diffusion-based differentiable inversion method (LD-DIM) for PDE-constrained inverse problems involving high-dimensional spatially distributed coefficients. LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization.</description>

      <title>ROM for Viscous, Incompressible Flow in Polygons -- exponential $n$-width bounds and convergence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate exponential convergence of Reduced Order Model (ROM) approximations for mixed boundary value problems of the stationary, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in plane, polygonal domains $\Omega$. Admissible boundary conditions comprise mixed BCs, no-slip, slip and open boundary conditions, subject to corner-weighted analytic boundary data and volume forcing. The small data hypothesis is assumed to ensure existence of a unique weak solution in the sense of Leray-Hopf. Recent results on corner-weighted, analytic regularity of velocity and pressure fields in $\Omega$, imply exponential convergence rates of so-called mixed $hp$-Finite Element Methods in $H^1(\Omega)^2\times L^2(\Omega)$ on sequences of geometric partitions of $\Omega$, with corner-refinement. Based on these exponential convergence rate bounds, we infer exponential bounds for the Kolmogorov $n$-widths of solution sets for analytic forcing and boundary data. This implies corresponding exponential convergence rates of POD Galerkin methods that are based on truth solutions which are obtained offline from low-order, divergence stable mixed Finite Element discretizations. Numerical experiments confirm the exponential rates and the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A high-order method for the numerical approximation of fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the periodic initial-value problem for the fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation is discretized in space by a Fourier spectral Galerkin method and in time by diagonally implicit, high-order Runge-Kutta schemes, based on the composition with the implicit midpoint rule (IMR). Some properties and error estimates for the semidiscretization in space and for the full discretization are proved. The convergence results and the general performance of the scheme are illustrated with several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Convergent numerical schemes for the viscoelastic Giesekus model in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a class of stable and convergent numerical methods for the approximate solution of the viscoelastic Giesekus model in two space dimensions. The model couples the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with an evolution equation for an additional stress tensor accounting for elastic effects. This coupled evolution equation is stated here in terms of the elastic deformation gradient and models transport and nonlinear relaxation effects. In the existing literature, numerical schemes for such models often suffer from accuracy limitations and convergence problems, usually due to the lack of rigorous existence results or inherent limitations of the discretization. Therefore, our main goal is to prove the (subsequence) convergence of the proposed numerical method to a large-data global weak solution in two dimensions, without relying on cut-offs or additional regularization. This also provides an alternative proof of the recent existence result by Bul\'{\i}\v{c}ek et al.~(Nonlinearity, 2022). Finally, we verify the practicality of the proposed method through numerical experiments, including convergence studies and typical benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Finite Element Approach for High-precision Guaranteed Lower Eigenvalue Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining high-precision guaranteed lower eigenvalue bounds remains difficult, even though the standard high-order conforming finite element (FEM) easily yields extremely sharp upper bounds. Recently developed rigorous approaches using such as Crouzeix--Raviart or linear conforming elements do not extend well to high-order FEM. Some non-standard FEM approaches can provide sharp eigenvalue bounds but are technically involved. This persistent gap between accurate upper bounds and equally sharp rigorous lower bounds via standard high-order conforming FEMs makes the problem technically demanding and highly competitive. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage rigorous algorithm that closes this gap by employing high-order FEM on graded meshes and producing rigorous lower eigenvalue bounds as sharp as the corresponding high-order upper bounds, as demonstrated in our numerical examples. Numerical experiments for the Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalue problems on square and dumbbell domains show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, particularly on graded or highly nonuniform meshes. These results confirm that the proposed approach provides a practical and competitive solution to the long-standing difficulty of obtaining sharp, reliable lower eigenvalue bounds.</description>

      <title>Frenet Immersed Finite Element Spaces on Triangular Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop geometry-conforming immersed finite element (GC-IFE) spaces on triangular meshes for elliptic interface problems. These IFE spaces are constructed via a Frenet-Serret mapping that transforms the interface curve into a straight line, allowing the interface jump conditions to be imposed exactly. Extending the framework of [7,8] from rectangular to triangular meshes, we introduce three procedures for constructing high-degree Frenet-IFE spaces: an initial construction based on monomial bases, a generalized construction using orthogonal polynomials, and reconstruction methods aimed at improving the conditioning of the associated mass matrix. The optimal approximation capability of the proposed IFE spaces is demonstrated through numerical examples. We further incorporate these spaces into interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic interface problems and observe optimal convergence rates in the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using recently developed algorithms, we compute and compare best $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ rational approximations of analytic functions on the unit disk. Although there is some theory for these problems going back decades, this may be the first computational study. To compute the $L^2$ best approximations, we employ a new formulation of TF-IRKA in barycentric form.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach to Solving First-Kind Fredholm Integral Equations and Their Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical recovery of solutions to first-kind Fredholm integral equations with discrete, scattered, and noisy pointwise measurements. Assuming the forward operator's range belongs to the Sobolev space of order $m$, which implies algebraic singular-value decay $s_j\le Cj^{-m}$, we derive optimal upper bounds for the reconstruction error in the weak topology under an a priori choice of the regularization parameter. For bounded-variance noise, we establish mean-square error rates that explicitly quantify the dependence on sample size $n$, noise level $\sigma$, and smoothness index $m$; under sub-Gaussian noise, we strengthen these to exponential concentration bounds. The analysis yields an explicit a priori and a posteriori rule for the regularization parameter. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of our practical parameter choice.</description>

      <title>High-order implicit Runge-Kutta time integrators for component-based model reduction of FSI problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model order reduction framework for incompressible fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems based on high-order implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods. We consider separate reduced spaces for fluid velocity, fluid pressure and solid displacement; we enrich the velocity space with supremizer modes to ensure the inf-sup stability of the fluid subproblem; we consider bubble-port decomposition of fluid velocity and solid displacement to satisfy the kinematic conditions at the fluid structure interface. We resort to Galerkin projection to define the semi-discrete reduced-order model and we consider a Radau-IIA IRK method for time integration: the resulting algebraic system is solved using static condensation of the interface degrees of freedom. The reduced-order model preserves a semi-discrete energy balance inherited from the full-order model, and avoids the need for additional interface enrichment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed combination of high-order IRK schemes with bubble-port decoupling of velocity and displacement degrees of freedom yields stable and accurate reduced-order model for long-time integration of strongly-coupled parametric FSI problems.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis on the Sphere and a Spherical ANOVA Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sensitivity analysis on the sphere. We present formulas that allow us to decompose a function $f\colon \mathbb S^d\rightarrow \mathbb R$ into a sum of terms $f_{\boldsymbol u,\boldsymbol \xi}$. The index $\boldsymbol u$ is a subset of $\{1,2,\ldots,d+1\}$, where each term $f_{\boldsymbol u,\boldsymbol \xi}$ depends only on the variables with indices in $\boldsymbol u$. In contrast to the classical analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition, we additionally use the decomposition of a function into functions with different parity, which adds the additional parameter $\boldsymbol \xi$. The natural geometry on the sphere naturally leads to the dependencies between the input variables. Using certain orthogonal basis functions for the function approximation, we are able to model high-dimensional functions with low-dimensional variable interactions.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for Gauss--Christoffel Quadrature under Reduced Regularity Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauss--Christoffel quadrature is a fundamental method for numerical integration, and its convergence analysis is closely related to the decay of Chebyshev expansion coefficients. Classical estimates, including those due to Trefethen, are based on weighted bounded variation assumptions involving the singular weight $(1-x^{2})^{-1/2}$, which may be too restrictive for functions with limited regularity at the endpoints.
  In this paper, we establish a new error bound for Gauss--Christoffel quadrature under weakened regularity assumptions. The analysis relies on a new identity for higher-order derivatives of Chebyshev polynomials. As a consequence, we obtain an improved decay estimate for Chebyshev coefficients, where the classical weighted condition \[ V_{r}=\int_{-1}^{1}\frac{|f^{(r+1)}(x)|}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\,dx \] is replaced by the weaker condition \[ U_{r}=\int_{-1}^{1}|f^{(r+1)}(x)|\,dx. \]
  This result leads to a corresponding error estimate for the Gauss--Christoffel quadrature rule, which is less restrictive than previous bounds. The approach is also extended to the Gauss--Gegenbauer case. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Analysis of kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo simulation and source term estimation scheme in nuclear fusion applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In plasma edge simulations, the behavior of neutral particles is often described by a Boltzmann--BGK equation. Solving this kinetic equation and estimating the moments of its solution are essential tasks, typically carried out using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. However, for large-sized reactors, like ITER and DEMO, high collision rates lead to a substantial computational cost. To accelerate the calculation, an asymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method (Mortier et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022) and a corresponding fluid estimation technique (Mortier et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys., 2022) have recently been proposed. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the convergence of KDMC combined with the associated fluid estimation. The analysis consists of proving theoretical upper bounds for both KDMC and the fluid estimation, and numerical verifications of these bounds. In addition, we compare the analyzed algorithm with a purely fluid-based method using the fully kinetic MC method as a reference. The algorithm consistently achieves lower error than the fluid-based method, and even one order of magnitude lower in a fusion-relevant test case. Moreover, the algorithm exhibits a significant speedup compared to the reference kinetic MC method. Overall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of KDMC with the associated fluid estimation in nuclear fusion applications.</description>

      <title>Learning L\'evy density via adaptive RKHS regression with bi-level optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonparametric method to learn the L\'evy density from probability density data governed by a nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation. We recast the problem as identifying the kernel in a nonlocal integral operator from discrete data, which leads to an ill-posed inverse problem. To regularize it, we construct an adaptive reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) whose kernel is built directly from the data. Under standard source and spectral decay conditions, we show that the reconstruction error decays in the mesh size at a near optimal rate. Importantly, we develop a generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based bilevel optimization algorithm to choose the regularization parameter, leading to efficient and robust computation of the regularized estimator. Numerical experiments for several L\'evy densities, drift fields and data types (PDE-based densities and sample ensemble-based KDE reconstructions) demonstrate that our bilevel RKHS method outperforms classical L-curve and generalized cross-validation strategies and that the adaptive RKHS norm is more accurate and robust than $L^2_\rho$- and $\ell^2$-based regularization.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Approximation of the Score Function and Its Derivatives by Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory for simultaneous approximation of the score function and its derivatives, enabling the handling of data distributions with low-dimensional structure and unbounded support. Our approximation error bounds match those in the literature while relying on assumptions that relax the usual bounded support requirement. Crucially, our bounds are free from the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, we establish approximation guarantees for derivatives of any prescribed order, extending beyond the commonly considered first-order setting.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Spectral Element Solver for Steady-State Free Surface Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral element solver for the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to a free surface. Utilizing the kinematic behaviour of the free surface boundary, an iterative pseudo-time procedure is proposed to determine the a priori unknown free surface profile. The numerical model is implemented in the open-source finite element framework Firedrake, which enables the use of a high-order polynomial basis on unstructured meshes through weak formulations. Additionally, the curvature of the free surface and submerged bodies is incorporated through curvilinear elements obtained via transfinite linear blending, which conserves the high-order convergent properties of the overall scheme. The model is applied to several benchmark cases in two spatial dimensions. Initially, it addresses fixed-domain problems, including the lid-driven cavity flow and flows around bodies such as a cylinder and a NACA airfoil. Subsequently, with the presence of a free surface, it is extended to determine the flow around a bathymetry bump and a submerged NACA airfoil. The results confirm the high-order accuracy of the model through convergence studies and demonstrate a substantial speed-up over low-order numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Time Reparametrization, Not Fractional Calculus: A Reassessment of the Conformable Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conformable derivative has been promoted in numerous publications as a new fractional derivative operator. This article provides a critical reassessment of this claim. We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering for waveguides in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the inverse scattering problem of a topologically non-trivial waveguide separating two-dimensional topological insulators. We consider the specific model of a Dirac system. We show that a short-range perturbation can be fully reconstructed from scattering data in a linearized setting and in a finite-dimensional setting under a smallness constraint. We also provide a stability result in appropriate topologies. We then solve the problem numerically by means of a standard adjoint method and illustrate our theoretical findings with several numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops signal-processing algorithms and implementation schemes under constraints of minimal parallelism and memory space, with the goal of improving energy efficiency of low-power computing hardware. We propose (i) a power/energy consumption model for clocked CMOS logic that supports selecting optimal parallelism, (ii) integer-friendly approximation methods for elementary functions that reduce lookup-table size via constrained piecewise-polynomial (quasi-spline) constructions with accuracy guarantees, (iii) provably conflict-free data placement and execution order for mixed-radix streaming FFT on multi-bank and single-port memories, including a self-sorting FFT variant, and (iv) a parallelism/memory analysis of the fast Schur algorithm for superfast Toeplitz system solving, motivated by echo-cancellation workloads. The results provide constructive theorems, schedules, and design trade-offs enabling efficient specialized accelerators.</description>

      <title>A first-order method for nonconvex-strongly-concave constrained minimax optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonconvex-strongly-concave constrained minimax problem. Specifically, we propose a first-order augmented Lagrangian method for solving it, whose subproblems are nonconvex-strongly-concave unconstrained minimax problems and suitably solved by a first-order method developed in this paper that leverages the strong concavity structure. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed method achieves an \emph{operation complexity} of $O(\varepsilon^{-3.5}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$, measured in terms of its fundamental operations, for finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT solution of the constrained minimax problem, which improves the previous best-known operation complexity by a factor of $\varepsilon^{-0.5}$.</description>

      <title>A Domain Decomposition-based Solver for Acoustic Wave propagation in Two-Dimensional Random Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An acoustic wave propagation problem with a log normal random field approximation for wave speed is solved using a sampling-free intrusive stochastic Galerkin approach. The stochastic partial differential equation with the inputs and outputs expanded using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is transformed into a set of deterministic PDEs and further to a system of linear equations. Domain decomposition (DD)-based solvers are utilized to handle the overwhelming computational cost for the resulting system with increasing mesh size, time step and number of random parameters. A conjugate gradient iterative solver with a two-level Neumann-Neumann preconditioner is applied here showing their efficient scalabilities.</description>

      <title>A space-time extension of a conservative two-fluid cut-cell diffusion method for moving geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a space-time extension of a conservative Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for two-phase diffusion in prescribed-motion geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: one scalar field is solved in each phase with discontinuous material properties, coupled by sharp interface conditions enforcing flux continuity and jump laws. To handle moving boundaries on a fixed Cartesian grid, the discrete balance is written over phase-restricted space-time control volumes, whose geometric moments (swept volumes and apertures) are used as weights in the finite-volume operators. This construction naturally accounts for the creation and destruction of cut cells (fresh/dead-cell events) and yields strict discrete conservation. The resulting scheme retains the algebraic structure of the static cut-cell formulation while incorporating motion through local geometric weights and interface coupling operators. A series of verification and validation tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate super-linear accuracy in space, robust behavior under repeated topology changes and conservation across strong coefficient jumps and moving interfaces. The proposed space-time cut-cell framework provides a conservative building block for multiphase transport in evolving geometries and a foundation for future free-boundary extensions such as Stefan-type phase change.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning for time-harmonic Maxwell's equations using the Laguerre transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method of numerically solving the Maxwell equations is considered for modeling harmonic electromagnetic fields. The vector finite element method makes it possible to obtain a physically consistent discretization of the differential equations. However, solving large systems of linear algebraic equations with indefinite ill-conditioned matrices is a challenge. The high order of the matrices limits the capabilities of the Gaussian method to solve such systems, since this requires large RAM and much calculation. To reduce these requirements, an iterative preconditioned algorithm based on integral Laguerre transform in time is used. This approach allows using multigrid algorithms and, as a result, needs less RAM compared to the direct methods of solving systems of linear algebraic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a numerical scheme for subdiffusion of variable exponent by combining the $L2-1_\sigma$ temporal discretization with finite element spatial approximation. In existing works, determining the superconvergence points requires solving a nonlinear equation related to the variable exponent at each time step. This work relaxes the selection criterion of superconvergence points without affecting the numerical accuracy, which may reduce the cost of determining superconvergence points. To handle the initial singularity of the solution, we employ a graded temporal mesh. Then we prove the stability and error estimates with a convergence rate $O\left(N^{-\min\{r\delta,2\}}+h^{\mu}\right)$ for the $L2-1_\sigma$ scheme of variable-exponent subdiffusion. Numerical results are performed to substantiate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Stiff Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01775v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are an effective approach for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems arising from simulations and experiments. One of the major shortcomings of NODEs, especially when coupled with explicit integrators, is its long-term stability, which impedes their efficiency and robustness when encountering stiff problems. In this work we present a structure-preserving NODE approach that learns a transformation into a system with a linear and nonlinear split. It is then integrated using an exponential integrator, which is an explicit integrator with stability properties comparable to implicit methods. We demonstrate that our model has advantages in both learning and deployment over standard explicit or even implicit NODE methods. The long-time stability is further enhanced by the Hurwitz matrix decomposition that constrains the spectrum of the linear operator, therefore stabilizing the linearized dynamics. When combined with a Lipschitz-controlled neural network treatment for the nonlinear operator, we show the nonlinear dynamics of the NODE are provably stable near a fixed point in the sense of Lyapunov. For high-dimensional data, we further rely on an autoencoder performing dimensionality reduction and Higham's algorithm for the matrix-free application of the matrix exponential on a vector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NODE approach in various examples, including the Robertson chemical reaction problem and the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel variant of the \emph{residual-free bubble} method (RFB) for advection dominated problems is presented. Since the usual RFB still suffers from oscillations and strong under/overshoots, the bubble space is enriched by \emph{patch bubbles}, giving more freedom to the bubble space.
  We use a recursive and efficient approach to accurately compute the bubbles. Numerical experiments clearly demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the standard RFB.
  The method is similar to the \emph{enhanced residual-free bubble} method (eRFB) proposed by Cangiani and S\"uli in 2005, but differs in the definition of the additional bubbles.</description>

Abstract: An optimal and robust low-order nonconforming finite element method is developed for the strain gradient elasticity (SGE) model in arbitrary dimension. An $H^2$-nonconforming quadratic vector-valued finite element in arbitrary dimension is constructed, which together with the Nitsche's technique, is applied for solving the SGE model. The resulting nonconforming finite element method is optimal and robust with respect to the Lam\'{e} coefficient $\lambda$ and the size parameter $\iota$, as confirmed by numerical results. Additionally, nonconforming finite element discretization of the smooth Stokes complex in two and three dimensions is devised.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop two energy-preserving splitting methods for solving three-dimensional stochastic Maxwell equations driven by multiplicative noise. We use operator splitting methods to decouple stochastic Maxwell equations into simple one-dimensional subsystems and construct two stochastic splitting methods, Splitting Method I and Splitting Method II, through a combination of spatial compact difference methods and the midpoint rule in time discretization for the deterministic parts, and exact unitary analytical solutions for the stochastic parts. Theoretical proofs show that both methods strictly preserve the discrete energy conservation law. Finally, numerical experiments fully verify the energy conservation of the methods and demonstrate that the temporal convergence order of the two splitting methods is first-order.</description>

      <title>SymMaP: Improving Computational Efficiency in Linear Solvers through Symbolic Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix preconditioning is a critical technique to accelerate the solution of linear systems, where performance heavily depends on the selection of preconditioning parameters. Traditional parameter selection approaches often define fixed constants for specific scenarios. However, they rely on domain expertise and fail to consider the instance-wise features for individual problems, limiting their performance. In contrast, machine learning (ML) approaches, though promising, are hindered by high inference costs and limited interpretability. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we propose a symbolic discovery framework-namely, Symbolic Matrix Preconditioning (SymMaP)-to learn efficient symbolic expressions for preconditioning parameters. Specifically, we employ a neural network to search the high-dimensional discrete space for expressions that can accurately predict the optimal parameters. The learned expression allows for high inference efficiency and excellent interpretability (expressed in concise symbolic formulas), making it simple and reliable for deployment. Experimental results show that SymMaP consistently outperforms traditional strategies across various benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: An abstract construction of coarse spaces for non-Hermitian problems and non-Hermitian domain decomposition preconditioners based on extended generalized eigenproblems was proposed in [Nataf and Parolin, arXiv:2404.02758] and analyzed on the matrix formulation. Building upon this work, we consider instead here the specific case of heterogeneous Helmholtz problems, and the derivation and analysis is performed at the continuous level. Albeit different from its derivation, its use of oversampling and the underlying eigenproblems, our approach shares similarities with the methods of Hu and Li [SIAM J. Numer. Anal, 63(2), 716-743, 2025] and Ma, Alber, Scheichl and Zhang [J. Sci. Comput., 105(3), No. 99, 2025].</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision General Alternating-Direction Implicit Method for Solving Large Sparse Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a three-precision formulation of the General Alternating-Direction Implicit method (GADI) designed to accelerate the solution of large-scale sparse linear systems $Ax=b$. GADI is a framework that can represent many existing Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) methods. These methods are a class of linear solvers based on a splitting of $A$ such that the solution of the original linear system can be decomposed into the successive computation of easy-to-solve structured subsystems. Our proposed mixed precision scheme for GADI solves these subsystems in low precision to reduce the overall execution time while computing the residual and solution update in high precision to enable the solution to converge to high accuracy. We develop a rounding error analysis of mixed precision GADI that establishes the rates of convergence of the forward and backward errors to certain limiting accuracies. Our analysis also highlights the conditions on the splitting matrices under which mixed precision GADI is guaranteed to converge for a given set of precisions. We then discuss a systematic and robust strategy for selecting the GADI regularization parameter $\alpha$, whose adjustment is critical for performance. Specifically, our proposed strategy makes use of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model trained on a dataset of low-dimensional problems to initialize $\alpha$. Finally, we proceed to a performance analysis of mixed precision GADI on an NVIDIA A100 GPU to validate our approach. Using low precision (Bfloat16 or FP32) to solve the subsystems, we obtain speedups of $2.6\times$, $1.7\times$, and $3.1\times$ over a full double precision GADI implementation on large-scale 2D, 3D convection-diffusion and complex reaction-diffusion problems (up to $1.3\times 10^{8}$ unknowns), respectively.</description>

Abstract: Accelerated training algorithms, such as adaptive learning rates (or preconditioning) and various normalization methods, are widely used but not fully understood. When regularization is introduced, standard optimizers like adaptive learning rates may not perform effectively. This raises the need for alternative regularization approaches such as AdamW and the question of how to properly combine regularization with preconditioning. In this paper, we address these challenges using the theory of preconditioning as follows: (1) We explain how AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam accelerates training through improving Hessian conditioning; (2) We explore the interaction between $L_2$-regularization and preconditioning, demonstrating that AdamW amounts to selecting the underlying intrinsic parameters for regularization, and we derive a generalization for the $L_1$-regularization; and (3) We demonstrate how various normalization methods such as input data normalization, batch normalization, and layer normalization accelerate training by improving Hessian conditioning. Our analysis offers a unified mathematical framework for understanding various acceleration techniques or deriving appropriate regularization schemes.</description>

      <title>Neural Measures for learning distributions of Random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) techniques with uncertainty quantification (UQ) represents a rapidly evolving frontier in computational science. This work advances Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by incorporating probabilistic frameworks to effectively model uncertainty in complex systems. Our approach enhances the representation of uncertainty in forward problems by combining generative modeling techniques with PINNs. This integration enables in a systematic fashion uncertainty control while maintaining the predictive accuracy of the model. We demonstrate the utility of this method through applications to random differential equations and random partial differential equations (PDEs).</description>

      <title>TENG++: Time-Evolving Natural Gradient for Solving PDEs With Deep Neural Nets under General Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Learning solution operator of dynamical systems with diffusion maps kernel ridge regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework with a dynamic-aware validation strategy for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Probability Flow Residual Minimization for High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving high-dimensional Fokker-Planck (FP) equations is a challenge in computational physics and stochastic dynamics, due to the curse of dimensionality (CoD) and the bottleneck of evaluating second-order diffusion terms. Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks, face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(d^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Adaptive Probability Flow Residual Minimization (A-PFRM) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint, which avoids explicit Hessian computation. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, A-PFRM solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the continuity equation induced by the PF-ODE. We leverage Continuous Normalizing Flows combined with the Hutchinson Trace Estimator to reduce the training complexity to linear scale $O(d)$, achieving an effective $O(1)$ wall-clock time on GPUs. To address data sparsity in high dimensions, we apply a generative adaptive sampling strategy and theoretically prove that dynamically aligning collocation points with the evolving probability mass is a necessary condition to bound the approximation error. Experiments on diverse benchmarks -- ranging from anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and high-dimensional Brownian motions with time-varying diffusion terms, to Geometric OU processes featuring non-Gaussian solutions -- demonstrate that A-PFRM effectively mitigates the CoD, maintaining high accuracy and constant temporal cost for problems up to 100 dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Dynamical Anatomy of Anderson Acceleration:From Adaptive Momentum to Variable-Mass ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a rigorous derivation and analysis of accelerated optimization algorithms through the lens of High-Resolution Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing.</description>
