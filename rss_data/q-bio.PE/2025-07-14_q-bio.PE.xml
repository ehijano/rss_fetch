      <title>Infectious Disease Transmission In A Modified SEIRS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compartmental models like the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)\cite{Kermack1927} and its extensions such as the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIRS)\cite{Ottar2020,Ignazio2021,Grimm2021,Paoluzzi2021} are commonly used to model the spread of infectious diseases. We propose here, a modified SEIRS, namely, an SEIRSD model which comprises of (i) a reverse transmission from exposed to susceptible compartment to account for the probabilistic character of disease transmission seen in nature, and (ii) inclusion of mortality caused by infection in addition to death by other causes. We observed that, a reverse flow from exposed to susceptible class, has a significant impact on the height of infection peaks and their time of occurrence. In view of the recent surges of Covid-19 variants, this study is most relevant.</description>

      <title>Detecting Evolutionary Change-Points with Branch-Specific Substitution Models and Shrinkage Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branch-specific substitution models are popular for detecting evolutionary change-points, such as shifts in selective pressure. However, applying such models typically requires prior knowledge of change-point locations on the phylogeny or faces scalability issues with large data sets. To address both limitations, we integrate branch-specific substitution models with shrinkage priors to automatically identify change-points without prior knowledge, while simultaneously estimating distinct substitution parameters for each branch. To enable tractable inference under this high-dimensional model, we develop an analytical gradient algorithm for the branch-specific substitution parameters where the computation time is linear in the number of parameters. We apply this gradient algorithm to infer selection pressure dynamics in the evolution of the BRCA1 gene in primates and mutational dynamics in viral sequences from the recent mpox epidemic. Our novel algorithm enhances inference efficiency, achieving up to a 90-fold speedup per iteration in maximum-likelihood optimization when compared to central difference numerical gradient method and up to a 360-fold improvement in computational performance within a Bayesian framework using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler compared to conventional univariate random walk sampler.</description>

      <title>Quiescence wins: The Discovery Of Slowness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of quiescence within the framework of Adaptive Dynamics for an SIQS (Susceptible - Infected - Quiescent) model with constant environment. In the first part of the paper, the competition of two strains which have the same basic fitness (same reproduction number) but different timing in quiescence is analyzed. Thereto, the complexity of the model is reduced: By a time scale argument, we approximate the SQIS model by an SIS model under the assumption of rapid switching between I and Q. Furthermore, using dimension reduction methods for the van Kampen expansion of the models, we replace the multi-dimensional SDE by an effective one dimensional SDE on the center manifold of the models. Finally, the fixation probabilities of the strains are derived.
  In the second part of the paper, we use concepts from adaptive dynamics to analyze the stochastic random walk on the trait space. We find that quiescence is favored by intrinsic stochastic effects. In the end, a more intuitive explanation is added to the mathematical arguments.
  The analysis suggests a new paradigm for the evolution of quiescence in parasites: In the present context, quiescence is not a bed-hedging strategy to escape detrimental conditions in a fluctuating environment, but a simple and efficient method to continuously control and slow down the time scale of life-history traits. It turns out that evolution favors slowness, with the analysis suggesting that this effect may be widespread in systems where species interact only indirectly through competition for resources.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Ecological Measures Of Functional Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding functional diversity, the range and variability of species' roles and actions within their communities, is key to predicting and preserving the functions that sustain both nature and human well-being. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on functional diversity measurement. We begin by consolidating essential criteria that effective measures of functional diversity should meet. We then evaluate fifteen widely used functional diversity metrics against these criteria and assess their performance across six synthetic ecosystem scenarios where optimal behavior is known. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that none of the widely used metrics fully satisfy all the established requirements, and all fail in at least one ecosystem scenario. In particular, we find that almost all metrics flagrantly violate set monotonicity and distance monotonicity, requirements that adding a novel species should increase diversity, and that the magnitude of that increase should grow with trait dissimilarity. We also find that metrics fail to decline when rare, functionally extreme species are lost, and even increase when a perfectly redundant species is added. These critical flaws leave them blind to the very biodiversity loss that functional diversity measures are intended to detect. Our findings underscore the urgent need to develop a new generation of functional diversity metrics that more accurately reflect ecological realities.</description>

      <title>IdentityByDescentDispersal.jl: Inferring dispersal rates with identity-by-descent blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The population density and per-generation dispersal rate of a population are central parameters in the study of evolution and ecology. The distribution of recent coalescent events between individuals in space can be used to estimate such quantities through the distribution of identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks. An IBD block is defined as a segment of DNA that has been inherited by a pair of individuals from a common ancestor without being broken by recombination. We introduce a Julia package for estimating effective population densities and dispersal rates from observed spatial patterns of IBD shared blocks. It implements the inference scheme proposed by Ringbauer, Coop, and Barton (2017). The package provides a user-friendly interface, supports efficient gradient-based optimization and accommodates arbitrary user-defined demographic models through numerical integration. This software aims to encourage a wider audience to utilize spatial genetic data for estimating dispersal rates, thereby motivating further research and expanding its applications.</description>
