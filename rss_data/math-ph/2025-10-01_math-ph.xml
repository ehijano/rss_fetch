      <title>Generalized Time-Coarse Graining via an Operator Cumulant Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for deriving effective dynamics from arbitrary time-dependent generators, based on a systematic operator cumulant expansion. Unlike traditional approaches, which typically assume periodic or adiabatic driving, our method applies to systems with general time dependencies and is compatible with any dynamics generated by a linear operator -- Hamiltonian or not, quantum or classical, open or closed. This enables modeling of systems exhibiting strong modulation, dissipation, or non-adiabatic effects. Our approach unifies Hamiltonian techniques such as Lie-transform Perturbation Theory (LPT) with averaging-based methods like Time-Coarse Graining (TCG), revealing their structural equivalence through the lens of generalized cumulants. It also clarifies how non-Hamiltonian terms naturally emerge from averaging procedures, even in closed systems. We illustrate the power and flexibility of the method by analyzing a damped, parametrically driven Kapitza pendulum, a system beyond the reach of standard tools, demonstrating how accurate effective equations can be derived across a wide range of regimes.</description>

      <title>Representations of Josephson junction on the unit circle and the derivations of Mathieu operators and Fraunhofer patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian J of the Josephson junction is introduced as a self-adjoint operator on l2 tensor l2. It is shown that J can also be realized as a self-adjoint operator HS1 on L2(S1) tensor L2(S1), from which a Mathieu operator given by "-d^2/d{\theta}^2 - 2{\alpha} cos {\theta}" is derived. A fiber decomposition of HS1 with respect to the total particle number is established, and the action on each fiber is analyzed. In the presence of a magnetic field, a phase shift defines the magnetic Josephson junction Hamiltonian HS1({\Phi}) and the Josephson current IS1({\Phi}). For a constant magnetic field inducing a local phase shift {\Phi}(x), the corresponding local current IS1({\Phi}(x)) is computed, and it is proved that the Fraunhofer pattern arises naturally.</description>

      <title>Classical BV cohomology of the $N=1$ spinning particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the classical Batalin--Vilkovisky cohomology at negative ghost number of the spinning particle, observed in ref. arXiv:1511.02135, is removed by a Koszul--Tate resolution involving saturation of Grassmann odd variables. The model thus satisfies the axioms of Felder and Kazhdan. The AKSZ formulation of the resolved model is described. We reveal partial information on the resolution of the constrained phase space, which involves resolving the parity-shifted tangent sheaf of the light-c\^one. Specialising to dimension one, we describe the full resolution.</description>

      <title>On the interim statistics for compact group characteristic polynomials and their derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Keating-Snaith central limit theorem proves that $\Lambda_N(A)=\log\det(I-A)$, for randomly drawn $A\in \operatorname{U}(N)$, suitably normalised, tends to a complex Gaussian random variable in the large $N$ limit. The deviations of the real and imaginary parts of $\Lambda_N(A)$, on the scale of a positive $k$th multiple of the variance, are known to be Gaussian but with a multiplicative perturbation in the form of the $2k$th moment coefficient. Here we study the interpolating regime by allowing $k=k(N)$ for both $\operatorname{Re}(\Lambda_N(A))$ and $\operatorname{Im}(\Lambda_N(A))$. Additionally our methods apply to the logarithm of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial evaluated at an eigenvalue of $A$.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics for Weakly Interacting Bosons in an Iterated High-Density Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the number of particles. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix to the projection onto the normalized order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of two-dimensional Coulomb gases with circular root- and jump-type singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the random polynomial $p_n(\rho):=\prod_{j=1}^n (|z_j|-\rho)$, where the points $\{z_j\}_{j=1}^n$ are the eigenvalue moduli of random normal matrices with a radially symmetric potential. We establish precise large $n$ asymptotic expansions for the moment generating function \[ \mathbb{E}\!\left[e^{\tfrac{u}{\pi}\mathrm{Im}\log p_n(\rho)}\, e^{a\,\mathrm{Re}\log p_n(\rho)}\right], \qquad u\in\mathbb{R}, \; a&gt;-1, \] where $\rho&gt;0$ lies in the bulk of the spectral droplet. The asymptotic expansion is expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions, which confirms a conjecture of Byun and Charlier. This also provides the first free energy expansion of two-dimensional Coulomb gases with general circular root- and jump-type singularities. While the $a=0$ case has already been widely studied in the literature due to its relation to counting statistics, we also obtain new results for this special case.</description>

      <title>Kapranov $L_{\infty}[1]$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given any K\"ahler manifold $X$, Kapranov discovered an $L_\infty[1]$ algebra structure on $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$. Motivated by this result, we introduce, as a generalization of $L_\infty[1]$ algebras, a notion of $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is a differential graded commutative algebra with unit. We show that standard notions (such as quasi-isomorphism and linearization) and results (including homotopy transfer theorems) can be extended to this context. For instance, we provide a linearization theorem.
  As an application, we prove that, given any DG Lie algebroid $(\mathcal{L},Q_{\mathcal{L}})$ over a DG manifold $(\mathcal{M},Q)$, there exists an induced $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra structure on $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the DG commutative algebra $(C^\infty(\mathcal{M}),Q)$ -- its unary bracket is $Q_{\mathcal{L}}$ while its binary bracket is a cocycle representative of the Atiyah class of the DG Lie algebroid. This $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$ is linearizable if and only if the Atiyah class of the DG Lie algebroid vanishes. However, the $L_\infty[1]$ ($\mathbb{K}$-)algebra $\Gamma(\mathcal{L})$ induced by this $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra is necessarily homotopy abelian.
  As a special case, we prove that, given any complex manifold $X$, the Kapranov $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathfrak{R}$-algebra $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$, where $\mathfrak{R}$ is the DG commutative algebra $(\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X,\bar{\partial})$, is linearizable if and only if the Atiyah class of the holomorphic tangent bundle $T_X$ vanishes. Nevertheless, the induced $L_\infty[1]$ $\mathbb{C}$-algebra structure on $\Omega^{0,\bullet}_X(T^{1,0}_X)$ is necessarily homotopy abelian.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the directional derivatives in accordance with the orthonormal frame {T, N, B} are defined in $M_{q}^{3}(c)$, and the extended Serret-Frenet relations by using Frenet formulas are expressed. Furthermore, we express the bending elastic energy function for the same particle in $M_{q}^{3}(c)$ according to curve $\alpha (s,\xi ,\eta )$ and geometrical interpretation of the energy for unit vector fields and we also solve Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic field vectors in $M_{q}^{3}(c).$</description>

      <title>Integrated Local Energy Decay for Waves with Time-Dependent Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove integrated local energy decay for solutions of the damped wave equation with time-dependent damping satisfying an appropriate generalization of the geometric control condition on asymptotically flat, stationary space-times. We first obtain a high frequency estimate, which we prove via a positive commutator estimate using an escape function explicitly constructed in terms of the damping around individual space-time trajectories. We combine the high frequency estimate with low and medium frequency results for the undamped problem, then we handle the damping term as a perturbation to obtain local energy decay.</description>

      <title>Very Weak Solutions and Asymptotic Behavior of Leray Solutions to the Stationary Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\bfu$ be a Leray solution to the Navier-Stokes boundary-value problem in an exterior domain, vanishing at infinity and satisfying the generalized energy inequality. We show that if there exist $R&gt;0$ and ${\sf s}\ge \frac23 q$, $q&gt;6$, such that the $L^{\sf s}-$norm of $\bfu$ on the spherical surface of radius $R$ divided by $R$ is less than a constant depending only on {\sf s} and $q$, then $\bfu(x)$ must decay as $|x|^{-1}$ for $|x|\to\infty$. This result is proved with an approach based on a new theory of very weak solutions in exterior domains which, as such, is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Computationally Efficient Finite Element Method for Shape Reconstruction of Inverse Conductivity Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse conductivity problem aims at determining the unknown conductivity inside a bounded domain from boundary measurements. In practical applications, algorithms based on minimizing a regularized residual functional subject to PDE constraints have been widely used to deal with this problem. However, such approaches typically require repeated iterations and solving the forward problem at each iteration, which leads to a heavy computational cost. To address this issue, we first reformulate the inverse conductivity problem as a minimization problem involving a regularized residual functional. We then transform this minimization problem into a variational problem and establish the equivalence between them. This reformulation enables the employment of the finite element method to reconstruct the shape of the object from finitely many measurements. Notably, the proposed approach allows us to identify the object directly without requiring any iterative procedure. {\it A prior} error estimates are rigorously established to demonstrate the theoretical soundness of the finite element method. Based on these estimates, we provide a criterion for selecting the regularization parameter. Additionally, several numerical examples are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach in shape reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Pointwise spinor quantum fields cannot be microcausal nor Poincar\'e covariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend and strengthen no-go results on pointwise-defined quantum fields to cover general spinors. We show that the weak continuity of quantum fields rules out equal-time canonical conjugate (anti)commutation relations in globally hyperbolic spacetimes; for quantum fields on Minkowski spacetime, weakly continuous translation covariance enforces the needed continuity and yields the same no-go. We also extend Wightman's no-go theorem to show that the weak continuity of quantum fields rules out fermionic microcausality in $C^2$ Lorentzian spacetimes. We finish by generalising Wizimirski's no-go theorem to show that the existence of a Poincar\'e-invariant vacuum precludes pointwise spinorial covariance on a Minkowski background -- ruling out, in particular, pointwise covariance for Weyl and Dirac fermions, for photons and gravitons -- which further highlights the difficulty of quantising gravity pointwisely.</description>

      <title>Computational Monogamy of Entanglement and Non-Interactive Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables Alice and Bob to exchange a secret key over a public, untrusted quantum channel. Compared to classical key exchange, QKD achieves everlasting security: after the protocol execution the key is secure against adversaries that can do unbounded computations. On the flip side, while classical key exchange can be achieved non-interactively (with two simultaneous messages between Alice and Bob), no non-interactive protocol is known that provides everlasting security, even using quantum information.
  In this work, we make progress on this problem. Our main technical contribution is a computational variant of the celebrated monogamy of entanglement game, where the secret is only computationally hidden from the players, rather than information-theoretically. In these settings, we prove a negligible bound on the maximal winning probability over all strategies. As a direct application, we obtain a non-interactive (simultaneous message) QKD protocol from any post-quantum classical non-interactive key exchange, which satisfies everlastingly secure assuming Alice and Bob agree on the same key. The protocol only uses EPR pairs and standard and Hadamard basis measurements, making it suitable for near-term quantum hardware. We also propose how to convert this protocol into a two-round protocol that satisfies the standard notion of everlasting security.
  Finally, we prove a no-go theorem which establishes that (in contrast to the case of ordinary multi-round QKD) entanglement is necessary for non-interactive QKD, i.e., the messages sent by Alice and Bob cannot both be unentangled with their respective quantum memories if the protocol is to be everlastingly secure.</description>

      <title>Pre-Distillation of Magic States via Composite Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic state distillation (MSD) is a cornerstone of fault-tolerant quantum computing, enabling non-Clifford gates via state injection into stabilizer circuits. However, the substantial overhead of current MSD protocols remains a major obstacle to scalable implementations. We propose a general framework for pre-distillation, based on composite pulse sequences that suppress systematic errors in the generation of magic states. Unlike typical composite designs that target simple gates such as $X$, $Z$, or Hadamard, our schemes directly implement the non-Clifford $\mathcal{T}$ gate with enhanced robustness. We develop composite sequences tailored to the dominant control imperfections in superconducting, trapped-ion, neutral-atom, and integrated photonic platforms. To quantify improvement in the implementation, we introduce an operationally motivated fidelity measure specifically tailored to the $\mathcal{T}$ gate: the T-magic error, which captures the gate's effectiveness in preparing high-fidelity magic states. We further show that the error in the channel arising from the injection of faulty magic states scales linearly with the leading-order error of the states. Across all platforms, our approach yields high-fidelity $\mathcal{T}$ gates with reduced noise, lowering the number of distillation levels by up to three. This translates to exponential savings in qubit overhead and offers a practical path toward more resource-efficient universal quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a multi-walker generalization of the true self-avoiding walk, the bricklayer model. We perform stochastic simulations and solve the continuum partial differential equations that describe the collective evolution of $N$ bricklayers/walkers. These equations were previously derived from hydrodynamic considerations. In the large-$N$ limit, the results from simulation agree with
  the solutions of the partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We consider algebras acting on Schur and Q-Schur polynomials, corresponding to Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) and BKP hierarchies. We present them in the spirit of affine Yangians, paying special attention to commutative subalgebras, box additivity property of eigenvalues and single hook expansion of operators.</description>

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study nonlinear superpositions of Riemann wave solutions admitted by quasilinear hyperbolic first-order systems of partial differential equations. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of non-elastic wave superpositions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise independent interactions of waves (quasi-rectifiability). In the case of the compressible Euler system, we describe the structure of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields associated with waves. We prove that a certain class of Lie module associated with a hydrodynamic-type systems can be uniquely transformed into a real Lie algebra in an angle-preserving manner. For the Euler system, we then demonstrate the connection between the transformed finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the infinite-dimensional algebra associated with waves. This enables a detailed investigation of the geometry of wave superpositions using tools from differential geometry and Lie group theory. In particular, we study the geometry of the manifold of wave superpositions in terms of deformations of submanifolds corresponding to Lie subalgebras associated with waves. Additionally, we present new methods and criteria for determining the quasi-rectifiability of Riemann k-waves.</description>

Abstract: Sparsely coupled Kuramoto oscillators offer a fertile playground for exploring high-dimensional basins of attraction due to their simple yet multistable dynamics. For $n$ identical Kuramoto oscillators on cycle graphs, it is well known that the only attractors are twisted states, whose phases wind around the circle with a constant gap between neighboring oscillators ($\theta_j = 2\pi q j/n$). It was conjectured in 2006 that basin sizes of these twisted states scale as $e^{-kq^2}$ to the winding number $q$. Here, we provide new numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture and uncover the dynamical mechanism behind the Gaussian scaling. The key idea is that, when starting with a random initial condition, the winding number of the solution stabilizes rapidly at $t \propto \log n$, before long-range correlation can develop among oscillators. This timescale separation allows us to calculate the winding number as a sum of weakly-dependent random variables, leading to a Central Limit Theorem derivation of the basin scaling.</description>

      <title>The Kuramoto model on the Sierpinski Gasket II: Twisted states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) of coupled phase oscillators on graphs approximating the Sierpinski gasket (SG). As the size of the graph tends to infinity, the limit points of the sequence of stable equilibria in the KM correspond to the minima of the Dirichlet energy, i.e., to harmonic maps from the SG to the circle. We provide a complete description of the stable equilibria of the continuum limit of the KM on graphs approximating the SG, under both Dirichlet and free boundary conditions. We show that there is a unique stable equilibrium in each homotopy class of continuous functions from the SG to the circle. These equilibria serve as generalizations of the classical twisted states on ring networks. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the KM on post-critically finite fractals. The results of this work reveal the link between self-similar organization and network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Short-range and long-range order: a transition in block-gluing behavior in Hom shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hom shifts form a class of multidimensional shifts of finite type (SFT) and consist of colorings of the grid Z2 where adjacent colours must be neighbors in a fixed finite undirected simple graph G. This class includes several important statistical physics models such as the hard square model. The gluing gap measures how far any two square patterns of size n can be glued, which can be seen as a measure of the range of order, and affects the possibility to compute the entropy (or free energy per site) of a shift. This motivates a study of the possible behaviors of the gluing gap. The class of Hom shifts has the interest that mixing type properties can be formulated in terms of algebraic graph theory, which has received a lot of attention recently. Improving some former work of N. Chandgotia and B. Marcus, we prove that the gluing gap either depends linearly on n or is dominated by log(n). We also find a Hom shift with gap {\Theta}(log(n)), infirming a conjecture formulated by R. Pavlov and M. Schraudner. The physical interest of these results is to better understand the transition from short-range to long-range order (respectively sublogarithmic and linear gluing gap), which is reflected in whether some parameter, the square cover, is finite or infinite.</description>

      <title>Sylvester-Preconditioned Adaptive-Rank Implicit Time Integrators for Advection-Diffusion Equations with Variable Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the adaptive-rank integration of {2D and 3D} time-dependent advection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with variable coefficients. We employ a standard finite-difference method for spatial discretization coupled with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal schemes. The discrete equation is a generalized Sylvester equation (GSE), which we solve with an adaptive-rank algorithm structured around three key strategies: {(i) constructing dimension-wise subspaces based on an extended Krylov strategy, (ii) developing an effective preconditioner for the reduced coefficient matrix, and (iii) efficiently computing the residual of the equation without explicitly reverting to the full-rank form. {The low-rank decomposition is performed in 2D using SVD, and with high-order SVD (HOSVD) in 3D to represent the tensor in a compressed Tucker format.} The computational complexity of the proposed approach {is demonstrated numerically to} be comparable to the constant-coefficient case [El Kahza et al, J. Comput. Phys., 518 (2024)], scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N {r^2} + {r^{d+1}})$ for $d$-dimensional problems (here, $d = 2$ or $3$), with $N$ the resolution in one dimension and $r$ the maximal rank during the Krylov iteration (which we find to be largely independent of $N$). We present numerical examples that illustrate the computational efficacy and complexity of our algorithm.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting work from a physical system is one of the cornerstones of quantum thermodynamics. The extractable work, as quantified by ergotropy, necessitates a complete description of the quantum system. This is significantly more challenging when the state of the underlying system is unknown, as quantum tomography is extremely inefficient. In this article, we analyze the number of samples of the unknown state required to extract work. With only a single copy of an unknown state, we prove that ergotropy approaches zero in the asymptotic limit, rendering work extraction nearly impossible. In contrast, when multiple copies are available, we quantify the sample complexity required to estimate extractable work, establishing a scaling relationship that balances the desired accuracy with success probability. Our work develops a sample-efficient protocol to assess the utility of unknown states as quantum batteries and opens avenues for estimating thermodynamic quantities using near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Computing entanglement costs of non-local operations on the basis of algebraic geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of distributed quantum information processing, it is crucial to minimize the entanglement consumption by optimizing local operations. We develop a framework based on algebraic geometry to systematically simplify the optimization over separable (SEP) channels, which serve as widely used models for local operations. We apply this framework to computing one-shot entanglement cost for implementing non-local operations under SEP channels, in both probabilistic and zero-error settings. First, we present a unified generalization of previous analytical results on the entanglement cost. Via the generalization, we resolve an open problem posed by Yu et al. regarding the entanglement cost of local state discrimination. Second, we strengthen the Doherty--Parrilo--Spedalieri hierarchy and determine the trade-off between the entanglement cost and the success probability of implementing various operations -- such as entanglement distillation, non-local unitary channels, measurements, state verification, and multipartite entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions of heat equation on unitary groups establish an improved relation between $\epsilon$-nets and approximate unitary $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concepts of $\epsilon$-nets and unitary ($\delta$-approximate) $t$-designs are important and ubiquitous across quantum computation and information. Both notions are closely related and the quantitative relations between $t$, $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ find applications in areas such as (non-constructive) inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev like theorems and random quantum circuits. In recent work, quantitative relations have revealed the close connection between the two constructions, with $\epsilon$-nets functioning as unitary $\delta$-approximate $t$-designs and vice-versa, for appropriate choice of parameters. In this work we improve these results, significantly increasing the bound on the $\delta$ required for a $\delta$-approximate $t$-design to form an $\epsilon$-net from $\delta \simeq \left(\epsilon^{3/2}/d\right)^{d^2}$ to $\delta \simeq \left(\epsilon/d^{1/2}\right)^{d^2}$. We achieve this by constructing polynomial approximations to the Dirac delta using heat kernels on the projective unitary group $\mathrm{PU}(d) \cong\mathbf{U}(d)$, whose properties we studied and which may be applicable more broadly. We also outline the possible applications of our results in quantum circuit overheads, quantum complexity and black hole physics.</description>

Abstract: We continue our work [arXiv:2403.07628] on asymptotic expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and Laguerre random matrix ensembles. By revisiting the construction of the associated skew-orthogonal polynomials in terms of wave functions, we obtain concise expressions for the level densities that are well suited for proving asymptotic expansions in powers of a certain parameter $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$. In the unitary case, the expansion for the level density can be used to reconstruct the first correction term in an established asymptotic expansion of the associated generating function. In the orthogonal and symplectic cases, we can even reconstruct the conjectured first and second correction terms.</description>

      <title>Law of fractional logarithm for random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Paquette-Zeitouni law of fractional logarithm (LFL) for the extreme eigenvalues [arXiv:1505.05627] in full generality, and thereby verify a conjecture from [arXiv:1505.05627]. Our result holds for any Wigner minor process and both symmetry classes, in particular for the GOE minor process, while [arXiv:1505.05627] and the recent full resolution of LFL by Baslingker et.~al.~[arXiv:2410.11836] cover only the GUE case which is determinantal. Lacking the possibility for a direct comparison with the Gaussian case, we develop a robust and natural method for both key parts of the proof. On one hand, we rely on a powerful martingale technique to describe precisely the strong correlation between the largest eigenvalue of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix and its $(N-k)\times (N-k)$ minor if $k\ll N^{2/3}$. On the other hand, we use dynamical methods to show that this correlation is weak if $k\gg N^{2/3}$.</description>

Abstract: Abstract spin chains axiomatize the structure of local observables on the 1D lattice which are invariant under a global symmetry, and arise at the physical boundary of 2+1D topologically ordered spin systems. In this paper, we study tensor categorical properties of DHR bimodules over abstract spin chains. Assuming that the charge transporters generate the algebra of observables, we prove that the associated category has a structure of modular tensor category with respect to the natural braiding. Under an additional assumption of algebraic Haag duality, this category becomes the Drinfeld center of the half-line fusion category.</description>

      <title>SEMPO -- Retrieving poles, residues and zeros in the complex frequency plane from an arbitrary spectral response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Singularity Expansion Method Parameter Optimizer -- SEMPO -- is a toolbox to extract the complex poles, zeros and residues of an arbitrary response function acquired along the real frequency axis. SEMPO allows to determine this full set of complex parameters of linear physical systems from their spectral responses only, without prior information about the system. The method leverages on the Singularity Expansion Method of the physical signal. This analytical expansion of the meromorphic function in the complex frequency plane motivates the use of the Cauchy method and auto-differentiation-based optimization approach to retrieve the complex poles, zeros and residues from the knowledge of the spectrum over a finite and real spectral range. Both approaches can be sequentially associated to provide highly accurate reconstructions of physical signals in large spectral windows. The performances of SEMPO are assessed and analysed in several configurations that include the dielectric permittivity of materials and the optical response spectra of various optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content remains largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian Kerr-Schild ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the Poincar\'e subalgebra containing exclusively time translations and spatial rotations. This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition, establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In Part II, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.</description>
