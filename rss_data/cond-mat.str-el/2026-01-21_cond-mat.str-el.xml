      <title>Observation of correlated plasmons in low-valence nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of nickelate superconductors has opened a new arena for studying the behavior of correlated electron liquids that give rise to unconventional superconductivity. While critical information about a material's charge dynamics is encoded in its plasmons, collective modes of the electron gas, these excitations have not yet been observed in nickelate materials. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates.</description>

      <title>${\bf \frac{h}{e}}$ flux quantization in metals due to Berry phase coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry curvature does not show itself in the relative phase correlation of wave-functions at different spatial points in a metal unless the fermions have closed trajectories in momentum space, for example those around isolated impurities. But these, just as the Bloch phase correlations, disappear at lengths larger than the diffusion length. If a quasi-two dimensional metal with Berry curvature has a set of domains, their boundaries necessarily carry chiral currents precluding back-ward scattering. The Berry induced phase coherence then persists over length scales of order the scale at which the chiral one-dimensional states scatter into the bulk states, which can be macroscopic. The conditions for their occurrence and the lengths and the orientation of such states are derived. These calculations are used to understand the remarkable aspects of a recent experiment in an anisotropic metal, reported to have loop-current order, with mean-free path of about 0.01 $\mu$m which exhibits flux quantization in some transport properties over lengths of several $\mu$m. %It is also shown that generating the appropriately oriented channels in the plane by the field applied is plausible.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal contributions of entanglement under different bipartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) is a fundamental probe of quantum phases and critical phenomena, which was thought to reflect only bulk universality for a long time. Very recently, people realized that the microscopic geometry of the entanglement cut can induce distinct entanglement-edge modes, whose coupling to bulk critical fluctuations may alter the scaling of the EE. However, this perception is very qualitative and lacks quantitative consideration. Here, we investigate this problem through high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with the analysis of scaling theory to build a quantitative understanding. By considering three distinct bipartitions corresponding to three surface criticality types, we reveal a striking dependence of the constant term {\gamma} on the microscopic cut at the quantum critical point. Notably, cuts that generate extra gapless edge modes yield a sign reversal in {\gamma} compared to those producing gapped edges. We explain this behavior via a modified scaling form that incorporates contributions from both bulk and surface critical modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derivative of EE robustly extracts the bulk critical point and exponent {\nu} regardless of the cut geometry, providing a reliable diagnostic of bulk universality in the presence of strong surface effects. Our work for the first time establishes a direct quantitative connection between surface criticality and entanglement scaling, challenging the conventional view that EE solely reflects bulk properties and offering a refined framework for interpreting entanglement in systems with boundary-sensitive criticality.</description>

      <title>Measurements of electronic band structure in CeCoGe$_3$ by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of the electronic structure of CeCoGe$_3$ throughout the entire Brillouin zone in the non-magnetic regime using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The electronic structure agrees in large part with first principles calculations, including predicted topological nodal lines. Two new features in the band structure are also observed: a surface state and folded bands, the latter which is argued to originate from a unit cell reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Coulomb Interactions from Embedded Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent first-principles framework for determining the screened Coulomb interaction strength (U) based on constrained dynamical mean-field theory (cDMFT). Unlike conventional approaches, this method incorporates essential vertex corrections within the same embedded-DMFT formalism used for the electronic structure calculation. Using the cDMFT-derived interaction strengths as input to embedded DMFT yields spectral functions in excellent agreement with photoemission experiments across a wide range of materials, spanning 3d to 5d transition-metal compounds, including correlated metals, Mott insulators, altermagnets, and unconventional superconductors. This unified many-body framework establishes a systematic first-principles route for determining interaction strengths in correlated materials and substantially enhances the predictive power of DFT+DMFT and its extensions.</description>

      <title>Emergent gauge flux and spin ordering in magnetized triangular spin liquids: applications to Hofstadter-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress in the moir\'e superlattice systems and spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the triangular-lattice spin liquids and study their magnetic responses. While the magnetic responses on the ordered phases can be mundane, the orbital magnetic flux and the Zeeman coupling have synergetic effects on the internal gauge flux generations in the relevant spin liquid phases. The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_{\chi}$ model and with the experimental consequences. Our results could find applications in the moir\'e superlattice systems with the Hofstadter-Hubbard model as well as the triangular lattice antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>SCF framework, HF stability and RPA correlation for Jordan-Wigner-transformed spin Hamiltonians on arbitrary coupling topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping spins to fermions via the Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation can render mean-field (Hartree-Fock, HF) descriptions effective for strongly correlated spin systems. As established in recent work, the application of such approaches is not limited by the nonlocal structure of JW strings or by site ordering, because string operators can be absorbed into Thouless rotations of a Slater determinant, and the variational optimization of a unitary Lie-Algebraic similarity transformation removes any ordering dependence. Leveraging these ideas, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) scheme that expresses the mean-field energy as a functional of the single-particle density matrix, providing an alternative to gradient-based optimization of Thouless parameters. We derive the analytic orbital Hessian to diagnose HF stability and compute ground-state correlation energy through the random-phase approximation (RPA). Benchmark results for the XXZ and J1-J2 model on one- and two-dimensional lattices demonstrate that RPA significantly improves mean-field accuracy.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped symmetric mass generation insulator: a quantum Monte-Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding unconventional superconductivity (SC) driven by strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to systematically investigate a bilayer fermionic model featuring strong interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange and on-site repulsive Hubbard interactions. This system serves as a prototypical model for realizing a symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulator. Our numerically exact results unambiguously demonstrate that robust superconducting pairing emerges upon doping the SMG phase. Remarkably, we find that the SC order is significantly enhanced by the repulsive Hubbard interaction. Given its potential relevance to the essential features of the high-$T_c$ superconductor $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ under pressure, our study establishes a new paradigm for superconductivity arising from a doped SMG parent state and provides key theoretical guidance for future experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.</description>

      <title>Dopant-Induced Symmetry Breaking Reveals Hidden Magnons in a Spin-Orbit Correlated Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated materials with competing spin-orbit and crystal-field interactions can host composite spin-orbital magnons that are highly susceptible to structural and electronic perturbations, enabling control of magnetic dynamics beyond spin-only physics. Using Raman spectroscopy on Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we show that the partial substitution of Ru by Mn reconstructs the magnon spectrum and leads to one-magnon modes that are hidden in the undoped state. We demonstrate that the transition-metal substitution activates otherwise symmetry-forbidden magnon modes through mirror-symmetry breaking of the underlying spin-orbital configuration. This effect can be theoretically explained by the local structural distortions induced in the RuO$_6$ octahedra near the dopant, that enable the observation of mixed-parity one-magnon modes. The uncovered mechanism demonstrates how spin-orbit-lattice entanglement can be exploited to control collective magnetic excitations in spin-orbit correlated materials.</description>

      <title>The Anderson impurity model from a Krylov perspective: Lanczos coefficients in a quadratic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lanczos coefficients in a quadratic model given by an impurity interacting with a multi-mode field of fermions, also known as single impurity Anderson model. We analytically derive closed expressions for the Lanczos coefficients of Majorana fermion operators of the impurity for different structures of the coupling to the hybridisation band at zero temperature. While the model remains quadratic, we find that the growth of the Lanczos coefficients structurally depends strongly on the chosen coupling. Concretely, we find $(i)$ approximately constant, $(ii)$ exactly constant, $(iii)$ square root-like as well $(iv)$ linear growth in the same model. We further argue that in fact through suitably chosen couplings, essentially arbitrary Lanczos coefficients can be obtained in this model. These altogether evince the inadequacy of the Lanczos coefficients as a reliable criterion for classifying the integrability or chaoticity of the systems. Eventually, in the wide-band limit, we find exponential decay of autocorrelation functions in all the settings $(i)-(iv)$, which demonstrates the different structures of the Lanczos coefficients not being indicative of different physical behavior.</description>

      <title>Two-Point Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy: a Computable Magic Proxy of Interacting Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.</description>

      <title>Strongly Quenched Kramers Doublet Magnetism in SmMgAl11O19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, and specific-heat measurements on the rare-earth hexaaluminate SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, where Sm$^{3+}$ realizes a strongly quenched Kramers doublet on a triangular lattice with an exceptionally weak net exchange scale. The Curie--Weiss analysis yields strongly reduced ground-doublet $g$ factors, $g_{ab}\simeq 0.65$ and $g_{c}\simeq 0.70$.
  This indicates that the low-temperature response is governed primarily by single-ion physics, with crystal-field splitting and $J$-multiplet mixing jointly renormalizing the Sm$^{3+}$ moment, rather than collective exchange. For $H \parallel c$, the specific heat shows no $\lambda$-type anomaly down to 0.35~K but evolves into a well-defined two-level Schottky peak whose gap grows linearly with field, yielding $g_c\simeq0.62$ and recovering nearly all of $R\ln2$ at high fields, thereby confirming an effective $S_{\mathrm{eff}}=\tfrac12$ Kramers doublet description for $T\lesssim10$~K.
  Together, these results establish SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ as a weak-exchange, nearly single-ion triangular Kramers magnet in which frustration produce an anisotropic low-field correlated regime without inducing long-range order.</description>

      <title>When electrons meet ferroelastic domain walls in Strontium Titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), famously described by Nobel laureate K. A. M\"uller as the "drosophila of solid-state physics", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides.</description>

Abstract: In modern technology, the optical readout of magnetic information is conventionally achieved by the magneto-optical Kerr effect, i.e., the polarization rotation of reflected light. The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Layout of Two-Dimensional Lattices for Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For quantum spin models defined on a two-dimensional lattice, we look for the best numbering of the lattice sites (a layout) that, at fixed bond dimension and other parameters of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, gives the lowest value of the variational energy, maximum entropy and truncation error. We consider the conjecture that the optimal layout is a Hamiltonian path, and that it optimizes a simply computable geometric cost function. Finding the minimum of such a function, which is a variant of the minimum linear arrangement problem, provides the DMRG with an efficient layout of the lattice and improves both accuracy and convergence time. We present applications to the antiferromagnetic and spin glass spin-1/2 models on the square and triangular lattices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy and disorder operator at kagome deconfined quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) candidate in the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice, employing quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study the entanglement entropy and the $U(1)$ disorder operator. In stark contrast to findings in $J$-$Q$ models and other candidates, the universal logarithmic correction coefficients for both quantities are found to be {positive}, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory (CFT). Crucially, the current central charge $C_J$, extracted from the small-angle behavior of the disorder operator, is enhanced by a factor of approximately {4/3} compared to that of the conventional 3D $O(2)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This enhancement {implies} a consistent explanation in the recently observed low-energy excitation spectrum at this DQCP, which features {two distinct linearly dispersing modes} with a velocity ratio of approximately three. Our results provide evidence that this quantum phase transition constitutes a genuine DQCP, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations that collectively modify its critical properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with parity-violating fermionic Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce equations of motion for a parity-violating fermionic mean-field theory (PV-FMFT): a numerically efficient fermionic mean-field theory based on parity-violating fermionic Gaussian states (PV-FGS). This work provides explicit equations of motion for studying the real- and imaginary-time evolution of spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with arbitrary geometries and interactions. We extend previous formulations of parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT) by including fermionic displacement operators in the variational Ansatz. Unlike PP-FMFT, PV-FMFT can be applied to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, describe quenches from arbitrary initial spin-1/2 product states, and compute local and non-local observables in a straight-forward manner at the same modest computational cost as PP-FMFT -- scaling as $O(N^3)$ in the worst case for a system of $N$ spins or fermionic modes. We demonstrate that PV-FMFT can exactly capture the imaginary- and real-time dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. We then study the post quench-dynamics of the one- and two-dimensional Ising model in presence of longitudinal and transversal fields with PV-FMFT and compute the single site magnetization and correlation functions, and compare them against results from other state-of-the-art numerical approaches. In two-dimensional spin systems, we show that the employed spin-to-fermion mapping can break rotational symmetry within the PV-FMFT description, and we discuss the resulting consequences for the calculated correlation functions. Our work introduces PV-FMFT as a benchmark for other numerical techniques and quantum simulators, and it outlines both its capabilities and its limitations.</description>

      <title>To infinity and back -- $1/N$ graph expansions of light-matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for performing a full graph expansion for light-matter systems, utilizing the linked-cluster theorem. This method enables us to explore $1/N$ corrections to the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ in the number of particles, giving us access to the mesoscopic regime. While this regime is yet largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying it with established approaches, it incorporates intriguing features, such as entanglement between light and matter that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. As a representative application, we calculate physical quantities of the low-energy regime for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising chain in the paramagnetic normal phase by accompanying the graph expansion with both exact diagonalization (NLCE) and perturbation theory (\pcst), benchmarking our approach against other techniques. We investigate the ground-state energy density and photon density, showing a smooth transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic regime up to the thermodynamic limit. Around the quantum critical point, we extract the $1/N$ corrections to the ground-state energy density to obtain the critical point and critical exponent using extrapolation techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of a doped one-dimensional excitonic insulator. Employing matrix-product-state-based methods, we compute the single-particle spectrum and optical conductivity in a correlated two-band model. Our numerical calculation reveals the emergence of a correlation-driven in-gap branch in the doped state. The origin of the in-gap branch is examined by decomposing the propagation dynamics of a single particle, elucidating that the doping-induced branch is associated with excitonic correlations. Our demonstrations suggest that the doping-induced branch can serve as an indicator of electron-hole correlations.</description>

      <title>Alternative $\nu+\nu$-picture of bosonic fractional Chern insulators at high filling factors in multiple flat-band systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most fractional quantum Hall states have been traditionally identified within a single energy band, such as the lowest Landau level or topological flat band. As more particles are introduced, they inevitably populate higher energy bands. Whether the inclusion of multiple topological bands leads to new physics remains an open question. Here, we propose a universal picture applicable at higher filling factors $\nu \geq 1$ in bosonic systems: the occupied bands tend to coalesce into an effective single topological band characterized by a total Chern number $\vert C\vert$, the sum of the Chern number of all occupied lower topological flat bands. Using a Kekul\'{e} lattice model with two lower flat bands featuring a total Chern number $C=1$, regardless of their specific configurations, we identify the emergence of a $\frac{1}{2}$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state at integer filling factor $\nu=1$, followed by the Jain sequence states $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$ at filling $\nu=\frac{4}{3}$ and $\frac{6}{4}$. That is a $\nu+\nu$ picture, rather than the generally expected $1+\nu^{\prime}$ picture, where $\nu^{\prime}$ is the permitted FCI filling factor in the single second topological flat band. Our findings deepen the understanding of FCI states and open avenues for discovering exotic fractional topological phases in multiband systems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic phases and phase transitions in Lieb-$5$ Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of altermagnetism, the collinear magnetic phase characterized by momentum-dependent spin-split bands but zero net magnetization, has fundamentally reshaped the classification of magnetic order. We propose an altermagnetic (AM) order in a repulsive Hubbard model on the Lieb-$5$ lattice. Considering only nearest-neighbor hoppings within the lattice, we show a phase transition from the nonmagnetic to a unique AM isolated band metal phase (AMIM), allowing clear identification of spin-split states. Additionally, the AM metallic phase (AMM) is also shown to appear as an intermediate phase during the transition from the normal metal to the AMIM in the presence of the diagonal hopping within each unit cell of the Lieb-$5$ lattice. The manifestation of distinct AM phases and the phase transitions, driven by Hubbard interaction and hopping integrals, have been explored in terms of spin-resolved band structure, spectral function, and the behavior of the AM order parameter. The stability of these AM phases against the spin-orbit coupling and temperature is also established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer and fractional Chern insulators exhibit a nonzero quantized anomalous Hall conductivity due to a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry. To identify nontrivial topology in their time-reversal symmetric many-body spectra, we introduce many-body Euler numbers as a counterpart to many-body Chern numbers. Exemplarily, we perform calculations in a topological Hubbard model that can realize Chern and fractional Chern insulating phases. Furthermore, we lay out a classification scheme to realize different topological phases in interacting systems using symmetry indicators in analogy to topological band theory.</description>

Abstract: Extending corresponding results for matrix product states [Verstraete and Cirac, PRB 73, 094423 (2006); Schuch et al. PRL 100, 030504 (2008)], it is shown how the approximation error of tree tensor network states (TTNS) can be bounded using Schmidt spectra or R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropies of the target quantum state. Conversely, one obtains bounds on TTNS bond dimensions needed to achieve a specific approximation accuracy. For tree lattices, the result implies that efficient TTNS approximations exist if $\alpha&lt;1$ R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts obey an area law, as in ground and low-energy states of certain gapped systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Generalized Shiraishi--Mori construction is exhaustive for ferromagnetic quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) constitute a subtle violation of ergodicity through a set of non-thermal eigenstates, referred to as scar states, which are embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum. In a broad class of known examples, these scar states admit a simple interpretation: they are magnon excitations of fixed momentum on top of a ferromagnetic background. In this paper we prove that any Hamiltonian hosting such ``ferromagnetic scar states'' necessarily admits a structural decomposition into a Zeeman term and an ``annihilator'' that annihilates the entire scar manifold. Moreover, we show that this annihilator must itself decompose into a sum of terms built from local projectors that locally annihilate the scar states. This architecture is closely related to the Shiraishi--Mori construction, and our main theorem establishes that an appropriate generalization of that construction is in fact essentially exhaustive for this class of scar states.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel matrix product representation of the Laughlin and related fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions based on a rigorous version of the correlators of a chiral quantum field theory. This representation enables the quantitative control of the coefficients of the Laughlin wavefunction times an arbitrary monomial symmetric polynomial when expanded in a Slater determinant or permanent basis. It renders the properties, such as factorization and the renewal structure, inherent in such fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions transparent. We prove bounds on the correlators of the chiral quantum field theory and utilize this representation to demonstrate the exponential decay of connected correlations and a gap in the entanglement spectrum on a thin cylinder.</description>

      <title>Reentrant superconductivity and Stoner boundaries in twisted WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin-valley instabilities and their connection to the reentrant superconducting states recently observed in the twisted bilayer dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ at a $5^o$ twist angle. Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moir\'e bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moir\'e valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moir\'e orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductivity is a time reversal symmetry breaking superconducting phase that has attracted broad interest as a potential platform for topological quantum computation. A fundamental consequence of this symmetry breaking is orbital magnetization, yet a clear microscopic formulation of this quantity has remained elusive. This difficulty arises because Bogoliubov quasiparticles do not carry a definite electric charge, precluding a simple interpretation of orbital magnetization in terms of circulating quasiparticle currents. Moreover, superconductivity and ferromagnetism rarely coexist, and in the few materials where they do (e.g. uranium-based compounds), strong spin-orbit coupling obscures the orbital contribution to the magnetization. The recent report of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which has negligible spin-orbit coupling, therefore provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a microscopic theory of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors. Here we develop such a theory, unifying the interband coherence effects underlying normal-state orbital magnetization with the intrinsic orbital moments of the Cooper-pair condensate. Applying our theory to rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we find that the onset of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the normal-state orbital magnetization, depending sensitively on the bandstructure. We further identify a generalized clapping mode corresponding to coherent fluctuations between the two opposite chiral windings of the p-wave order parameter, with a gap set by the sublattice winding form factor. This collective mode is unique to chiral superconductors and contributes to the orbital magnetization through its role in dressing the photon vertex. Experimental measurements of the orbital magnetization relative to the quarter-metal phase would provide a direct test of our theory.</description>

      <title>Operator delocalization in disordered spin chains via exact MPO marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator delocalization in disordered one-dimensional spin chains by introducing -- besides the already known operator mass -- a complementary measure of operator complexity: the operator length. Like the operator nonstabilizerness, both these quantities are defined from the expansion of time-evolved operators in the Pauli basis. They characterize, respectively, the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially and the spatial extent of its support. We show that both the operator mass and length can be computed efficiently and exactly within a matrix-product-operator (MPS) framework, providing direct access to their full probability distributions, without resorting to stochastic sampling. Applying this approach to the disordered XXZ spin-1/2 chain, we find sharply distinct behaviors in non-interacting and interacting regimes. In the Anderson-localized case, operator mass, length, and operator entanglement entropy rapidly saturate, signaling the absence of scrambling. By contrast, in the many-body localized (MBL) regime, for arbitrarily weak interactions, all quantities exhibit a robust logarithmic growth in time, consistent with the known logarithmic light cone of quantum-correlation propagation in MBL. We demonstrate that this behavior is quantitatively captured by an effective $\ell$-bit model and persists across system sizes accessible via tensor-network simulations.</description>

      <title>Influence of leads on signatures of strongly-correlated zero-bias anomaly in double quantum dot measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of disorder and interactions is known in many systems to produce a feature in the single-particle density of states, the shape and parameter dependence of which act as signatures of the underlying electronic state. Strong Coulomb repulsion gives rise to a host of novel phenomena, among these is a unique zero-bias anomaly. While understanding of the anomaly in bulk materials remains incomplete, a version of this anomaly can be found in an ensemble of two-site systems and hence has been predicted to be observable in parallel-coupled double quantum dots. However, prior work did not include the influence of the leads. Here we show that the presence of the leads results in changes to the projected stability diagrams but that the signature of the strongly-correlated zero-bias anomaly nonetheless remains clearly visible.</description>

      <title>Unusual antiferromagnetic order and fluctuations in RbMn$_{6}$Bi$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional RbMn$_{6}$Bi$_{5}$, the first pressure-induced ternary Mn-based superconductor, exhibits a phase diagram analogous to those of cuprate and iron-based superconductors, with superconductivity neighboring antiferromagnetic order. Here, we use $^{55}$Mn and $^{87}$Rb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to unravel its magnetic structure and fluctuations. Above the N\'eel temperature ($T_{\rm N}$), strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations dominate, characteristic of a paramagnetic state with pronounced spin-lattice relaxation rate enhancement. Below $T_{\rm N}$, a first-order phase transition establishes a commensurate antiferromagnetic order, where Mn atoms at the pentagon corners exhibit distinct magnetic moments with different orientations, while the central Mn atom carries no magnetic moment. The complex magnetic architecture, revealed by zero-field and high-magnetic-field NMR spectra, contrasts with earlier neutron diffraction models proposing uniform spin density waves, instead supporting localized moments ordering with charge rearrangement. The proximity of robust antiferromagnetic fluctuations to the high-pressure superconducting phase suggests a potential role for magnetic excitations in mediating unconventional Cooper pairing, akin to paradigmatic high-$T_c$ systems. These findings provide critical insights into the interplay between geometric frustration, magnetic order, and superconductivity in manganese-based materials.</description>

      <title>Connecting Magic Dynamics in Thermofield Double States to Spectral Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under unitary evolution, chaotic quantum systems initialized in simple states rapidly develop high complexity, precluding any efficient classical description. Quantum chaos is traditionally characterized by spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, most notably through the spectral form factor, while the hardness of classical simulation within the stabilizer formalism, commonly referred to as quantum magic, can be quantified by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition. We then demonstrate this relation explicitly in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, using an auxiliary-spin representation of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy that exhibits an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry. We further find that, in the high-temperature regime of the SYK model, the transition occurs at a finite time, with the long-time phase marked by spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In contrast, at low temperatures, the transition is pushed to times exponentially long in the system size. Our results reveal an intriguing interplay between quantum chaos and quantum magic.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Orbital Hybridization: An Exotic Strategy to Manipulate Orbital Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) plays a crucial role in the next-generation spin-orbitronics. Enhancing its efficiency is both fundamentally and practically interesting and remains a challenge to date. Recently, orbital counterparts of spin effects that do not rely on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been found as an alternative mechanism to realize it. This work highlights the engineering of copper oxidation states for manipulating the orbital current and its torque in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. The orbital hybridization and thus the orbital-Rashba-Edelstein effect at the CuO$_x$/Cu interfaces are significantly enhanced by increasing the copper oxidation state, yielding a torque efficiency that is almost ten times larger than the conventional heavy metals. The Cu$_4$O$_3$/Cu interface, rather than the widely accepted CuO/Cu interface, is revealed to account for the enhanced SOT performance in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. In addition, the torque efficiency can be alternatively switched between high and low thresholds through the redox reaction. The current results establish an exotic and robust strategy for engineering the orbital current and SOT for spin-orbitronics, which applies to other weak-SOC materials.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum bound pairs of two electrons in an altermagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the two-electron problem on a square lattice with $d$-wave altermagnetism, considering both on-site and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions. The altermagnetic spin-splitting in the single-particle dispersion naturally gives rise to a ground state of two-electron bound pairs with nonzero center-of-mass momentum. This finite-momentum pairing can be interpreted as a two-body mechanism underlying the recently proposed altermagnetism-induced Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state. Additionally, when the nearest-neighbor attraction is strong, the resulting finite-momentum bound pairs exhibit a mixture of both spin-singlet and spin-triplet characteristics, suggesting the possibility of unconventional superconductors, where spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings coexist.</description>

      <title>Correlation lengths of flat-band superconductivity from quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band superconductors provide a regime in which kinetic energy is quenched, so that pairing is governed primarily by interactions and quantum geometry. We investigate characteristic superconducting length scales in all-flat-band systems under the assumptions of time-reversal symmetry and spatially-uniform pairing, focusing on the size of the lowest-lying two-body bound state, the average Cooper-pair size, and the zero-temperature coherence length in two-band Hubbard models. Using the Creutz ladder and the $\chi$ lattice as representative examples, we show that both the two-body bound-state size and the many-body Cooper-pair size remain finite and small in the weak-coupling limit, being controlled by the quantum metric of the flat bands. By contrast, the coherence length exhibits qualitatively distinct behavior, diverging in the dilute limit and in the vicinity of insulating regimes. These results demonstrate that, in flat-band superconductors, the pair size and the coherence length are fundamentally distinct physical quantities and highlight the central role of band geometry in shaping superconducting length scales when kinetic energy is quenched.</description>

      <title>Weakly anisotropic superconductivity of Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, studying the upper critical field and its anisotropy has been crucial for understanding superconducting mechanism and guiding applications. Here we perform in situ high-pressure angular-dependent electrical transport measurements on Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals using a custom diamond anvil cell (DAC) rotator and confirming its anisotropic superconductivity. The anisotropy parameter is approximately 1.6, decreasing with increasing temperature and approaches 1 near Tc. Comparing effective mass anisotropy and inter-block distance in cuprates and iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) reveals that Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals superconductors are consistent with a two-band model, where intralayer quantum confinement within the unit cell induces interlayer coherence, thereby leading to three-dimensional (3D) superconductivity. This study not only establishes the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in bulk Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, but also provide critical insight into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates stimulated intense research into their correlated electron physics. Establishing the diversity of ground states across different Ruddlesden-Popper phases is crucial for elucidating the superconducting mechanisms in these nickelates. Motivated by the recent report of superconductivity in hybrid 1212-type La5Ni3O11, we synthesized and investigated the long-range-ordered hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7. In contrast to its bilayer counterpart, the 1313-type La3Ni2O7 exhibits characteristic semiconducting behavior at ambient pressure, displaying a distinct anomaly at 170 K. This behavior is consistently evidenced by measurements of both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy unambiguously indicates a spin-density-wave transition occurring at 170 K. High-pressure electrical transport measurements demonstrate the induction of metallization under pressure, yet reveal no discernible traces of superconductivity up to 65 GPa. Our findings establish hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7 as a new member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family exhibiting a distinct spin-density-wave transition, and offers a new platform for investigating the interplay among crystal structure, electronic orders, and superconductivity in hybrid nickelates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that magnetism in moir\'e Mott-Wigner crystals can be induced by the collective vibration of electrons around their equilibrium positions (i.e., electronic phonons), even without spin interactions between electrons. Due to a geometric valley-orbit coupling from the Berry phase effect, the zero-point energy of electronic phonons reaches minimum when electrons are fully valley polarized. This leads to a spontaneous magnetization when below a critical temperature. We also propose to engineer the magnetism through the photoexcitation of chiral electronic phonons.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time certification of fidelity for many-body mixed states and mixed-state universality classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computation of Uhlmann fidelity between many-body mixed states generally involves full diagonalization of exponentially large matrices. In this work, we introduce a polynomial-time algorithm to compute certified lower and upper bounds for the fidelity between matrix product density operators (MPDOs). Our method maps the fidelity estimation problem to a variational optimization of sequential quantum circuits, allowing for systematic improvement of the lower bounds by increasing the circuit depth. Complementarily, we obtain certified upper bounds on fidelity by variational lower bounds on the trace distance through the same framework. We demonstrate the power of this approach with two examples: fidelity correlators in critical mixed states, and codeword distinguishability in an approximate quantum error-correcting code. Remarkably, the variational lower bound accurately track the universal scaling behavior of the fidelity with a size-consistent relative error, allowing for the extraction of previously unknown critical exponents. Our results offer an exponential improvement in precision over known moment-based bounds and establish a scalable framework for the verification of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of the layered CaAl$_2$Si$_2$-type diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)(Cd$_{1-y}$Mn$_y$)$_2$As$_2$ over a broad Mn (spin) substitution range of $0.05 \le y \le 0.5$. K substitution introduces hole carriers, whereas Mn provides local moments, resulting in bulk ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures up to $\sim 17$ K. Intrinsic magnetic ordering is further supported by an anomalous Hall contribution and a specific-heat anomaly near $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. A key performance feature is a colossal negative magnetoresistance: for heavily Mn-doped compositions ($y \ge 0.3$), $\mathrm{MR}=[\rho(H)-\rho(0)]/\rho(0)$ reaches approximately $-100\%$ at 2 K and nearly saturates at a relatively low magnetic field of $\sim 0.35\,\mathrm{T}$. The combination of soft ferromagnetism, strong spin-charge coupling, and low-field MR saturation highlights (Ba,K)(Cd,Mn)$_2$As$_2$ as a promising bulk platform for low-temperature magnetoresistive functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the main targets of quantum simulations. This focus - together with rapid advances in quantum-computing hardware - has driven increasing applications in high-energy physics, particularly in lattice gauge theories. However, most existing experimental demonstrations remain restricted to (1+1)-dimensional and/or abelian gauge theories, such as the Schwinger model and the toric code. It is essential to develop quantum simulations of nonabelian gauge theories in higher dimensions, addressing realistic problems in high-energy physics. To fill the gap, we demonstrate a quantum simulation of thermalization dynamics in a (2+1)-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$ Yang-Mills theory using a trapped-ion quantum computer. By restricting the irreducible representations of the gauge fields to the integer-spin sector of $\mathrm{SU}(2)_3$, we obtain a simplified yet nontrivial model described by Fibonacci anyons, which preserves the essential nonabelian fusion structure of the gauge fields. We successfully simulate the real-time dynamics of this model using quantum circuits that explicitly implement $F$-moves. In our demonstrations, the quantum circuits execute up to 47 sequential $F$-moves. We identify idling errors as the dominant error source, which can be effectively mitigated using dynamical decoupling combined with a parallelized implementation of $F$-moves.</description>

      <title>Interlayer charge transfer from contact electrification in conducting micro and nanoscale thin film heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact electrification give rise to charge accumulation at the interface when two materials are brought into contact with each other. The charge accumulation at the interface will diffuse to the interior of the conducting material if the dimensions of the contacting conducting material is of the order of an unknown critical length scale. This contact electrification induced interlayer charge transfer will modify the fundamental physical properties of both the contacting materials. This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials.</description>

      <title>Layer-engineered quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted rhombohedral graphene family</title>

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is uniquely characterized by the topological Chern number C. Controlling the Chern number is a key step toward functional topological electronics and enables access to exotic quantum phases beyond the traditional quantum Hall physics. Here, we report a series of QAH insulators in twisted rhombohedral graphene family, in which the Chern number can be tuned through layer configuration, in-situ electrostatic doping, and displacement field. Specifically, in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral N-layer graphene, denoted as (1+N) L, we observe QAH states with C=N at moire filling v=1, where N=3,4,5 represents the layer number of rhombohedral graphene. These results are experimentally confirmed by quantized Hall resistance and the Streda formula. In twisted monolayer-trilayer graphene, we also observe states with |C|=3 at v=3, whose sign can be switched by either electrostatic doping or displacement field. Furthermore, in twisted Bernal bilayer-rhombohedral tetralayer graphene denoted as (2+4) L, we demonstrate a displacement-field-driven topological phase transition between two distinct QAH states with C=3 and C=4 at v=1. Our work establishes twisted rhombohedral graphene as a highly versatile, layer-engineered platform for designing and dynamically controlling high-Chern-number topological matters.</description>

      <title>Sparse Statistical Modeling in Condensed Matter Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the possibility of using sparse statistical modeling in condensed matter physics. The procedure is employed to two well known problems: elemental superconductors and heavy fermions, and was shown that in most cases performs better than other AI methods, such as machine or deep learning. More importantly, sparse modeling has two major advantages over other methods: the ability to deal with small data sets and in particular its interpretabilty. Namely, sparse modeling can provide insight into the calculation process and allow the users to give physical interpretation of their results. We argue that many other problems in condensed matter physics would benefit from these properties of sparse statistical modeling.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Steady States and Quantum Chaos in a three-site Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Chains base on Self-Consistent Mean-Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12844v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product-state-based band-Lanczos solver for quantum cluster approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present matrix-product state (MPS) based band Lanczos method as solver for quantum cluster methods such as the variational cluster approximation. While a na\"ive implementation of MPS as cluster solver would barely improve its range of applicability, we show that our approach makes it possible to treat cluster geometries well beyond the reach of exact diagonalization methods. The key modifications we introduce are a continuous energy truncation combined with a convergence criterion that is more robust against approximation errors introduced by the MPS representation and provides a bound to deviations in the resulting Green's function. The potential of the resulting cluster solver is demonstrated by computing the self-energy functional for the single-band Hubbard model at half filling in the strongly correlated regime, on different cluster geometries. Here, we find that only when treating large cluster sizes, observables can be extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit, which we demonstrate at the example of the staggered magnetization. Treating clusters sizes with up to $6\times 6$ sites we obtain significant improvement over the extrapolation accessible with exact diagonalization solvers when comparing to quantum Monte Carlo results. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the MPS cluster solver to more complex models by calculating spectral properties as relevant for the electron-doped cuprate CaCuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale quantum many-body systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding strongly correlated physics. However, two fundamental problems, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the action of a non-invertible symmetry on spins chains whose topological lines are labelled by representations of the four-dimensional Taft algebra. The main peculiarity of this symmetry is the existence of junctions between distinct indecomposable lines. Sacrificing Hermiticity, we construct several symmetric, frustration-free, gapped Hamiltonians with real spectra and analyse their ground state subspaces. Our study reveals two intriguing phenomena. First, we identify a smooth path of gapped symmetric Hamiltonians whose ground states transform inequivalently under the symmetry. Second, we find a model where a product state and the so-called W state spontaneously break the symmetry, and propose an explanation for the indistinguishability of these two states in the infinite-volume limit in terms of the symmetry category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism defies conventional classifications of collinear magnetic phases, standing apart from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism with its unique combination of spin-dependent symmetries, net-zero magnetization, and anomalous Hall transport. Although altermagnetic states have been realized experimentally, their integration into functional devices has been hindered by the structural rigidity and poor tunability of existing materials. First, through cobalt intercalation of the superconducting 2H-NbSe$_2$ polymorph, we induce and stabilize a robust altermagnetic phase and using both theory and experiment, we directly observe the lifting of Kramers degeneracy. Additionally, we present spectroscopic insight into a previously hinted low-temperature phase, and provide evidence of its electronic origin. While shedding light on overlooked aspects of altermagnetism, these findings open pathways to spin-based technologies and lay a foundation for advancing the emerging field of altertronics.</description>

      <title>A Quieter State of Charge -- Ultra-Low-Noise Collective Current in Charge-Density-Wave Nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices. There is a strong need for unconventional materials and strategies for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics. Here, we demonstrate that in nanowires of the quasi-one-dimensional, fully gapped charge-density-wave material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current, I -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. No residual minimum noise level is reached for the current of the electron-lattice condensate in (TaSe4)2I nanowires. Repeating the measurements for another charge-density wave conductor, NbS3-II, we found a similar reduction below the normal electron limit at room temperature. Our findings signal intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated electron transport regime.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of lattice models which possess subsystem non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and analyze their interface modes protected by the symmetry, whose codimension turns out to be more than one. We also propose 2+1d lattice models which belong to two different weak SPT phases distinguished by a combination of translational symmetry and non-invertible symmetry. We show that the interface between them exhibits an exotic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly associated with a modulated symmetry, which cannot be factorized into a direct product of internal and translational symmetries.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18969v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration-free interacting models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, we find that the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. A straightforward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) domain wall of 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological orders is studied theoretically. The Ising domain wall model is shown to have an emergent SU(2)$_{1}$ conformal symmetry because of a hidden nonsymmorphic octahedral symmetry. While a weak magnetic field is an irrelevant perturbation to the bulk topological orders, it induces a domain wall transition from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a ferromagnetic order, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry on the domain wall. Moreover, the gapless domain wall state also realizes a 1D topological quantum critical point between a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T}$-symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase, thus demonstrating the holographic construction of topological transitions.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalization group approach to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene using topological heavy fermion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory for the topological heavy fermion (THF) model, describing magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) as an emergent Anderson lattice. Our theory focuses on an energy window where the interactions can be treated perturbatively within the THF model, providing insights into the low-energy physics. In particular, the realistic parameters place MATBG near an intermediate regime where the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the hybridization energy $\gamma$ are comparable, motivating the need for RG analysis. Our approach analytically tracks the flow of single-particle parameters and Coulomb interactions within an energy window below $0.1$ eV, providing implications for distinguishing between Kondo-like ($U\gg \gamma$) and projected-limit/Mott-semimetal ($U\ll \gamma$) scenarios at low energies. We show that the RG flows generically lower the ratio $U/\gamma$ and drive MATBG toward the chiral limit, consistent with the previous numerical study based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald model. The framework presented here also applies to other moir\'e systems and stoichiometric materials that admit a THF description, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, twisted checkerboard model, and Lieb lattice, among others, providing a foundation for developing low-energy effective theories relevant to a broad class of topological flat-band materials.</description>

      <title>Doping $S=1$ antiferromagnet in one-dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic ground states, when doped, give rise to rich and complex phenomena, prompting detailed investigations in various spin systems. Here, we study the effect of doping on the one-dimensional $S = 1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (AFM). Specifically, we investigate how the presence of holes affects the static and dynamic (frequency-dependent) spin-spin correlations of the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori chain. The latter, at half-filling and in the strong-interaction limit, maps onto an $S = 1$ Heisenberg model. For moderate interactions, an orbital resonating-valence-bond (orbital-RVB) state emerges up to doping levels of $x \lesssim 0.3$. A detailed analysis of interaction strength $U$ and doping concentration $x$ reveals that this phase inherits the key features of spin excitations found in the half-filled case -- namely, a gapped spin spectrum and ``coherent'' magnon behavior up to a wavevector $q$ determined by the Fermi vector, $2k_\mathrm{F} = \pi(1 - x)$. Furthermore, our results uncover an additional broad, incoherent spectral weight for $q \gtrsim 2k_\mathrm{F}$ at high frequencies. Finally, we show that near the transition to a ferromagnetic phase, a previously unidentified spiral-like state emerges, characterized by spin excitations reminiscent of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: A Gauging Nexus between Topological and Fracton Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. B 112, 125124 (2025)], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper, we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Consistent gauge theories for the slave particle representation of the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to clarify the confusion and inconsistency in our recent works [1,2], and to address the incompleteness therein. In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints is BRST-exact in our theory. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</description>

      <title>Kink in Stoner Factor as a Signature of Changing Magnetic Fluctuations in the Organic Conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We employed a four-band model in which each BETS molecule is considered as a site and a two-band model that considers each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around $T_\mathrm{kink} \approx 5 \mathrm{meV}$, which indicates a change in the dominant magnetic fluctuations. A broad structure indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations was observed above $T_\mathrm{kink}$, whereas the spin susceptibility peaked at a wavevector corresponding to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations below $T_\mathrm{kink}$. The kink disappears as the intra-dimer transfer integral increased and the AFM fluctuations were enhanced. Our findings are consistent with those of previous experimental observations, which have also reported a change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the Schmidt gap, the von Neumann entanglement entropy, and the non-stabiliserness in proximity to the classical phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model (LRTFIM). Leveraging the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) within a tensor-network formulation, we simulate thermal states through their purified tensor-network representations. Our results show that these observables, typically regarded as hallmarks of quantum criticality, exhibit pronounced and coherent signatures even at a classical thermal transition, highlighting the emergence of quantum complexity as the system nears thermal criticality.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling theory of bilayer plasmon excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently plasmon excitations in bilayer lattice systems were studied extensively in the weak-coupling regime. Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $\omega_{\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $\omega_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The commensurate charge-density-wave phase of the prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide $1T$-TaS$_2$ is investigated by temperature- and polarization-dependent infrared spectroscopy, revealing distinct charge dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the layers. Supported by density-functional-theory calculations, we show that the in-plane electronic structure in the low-temperature commensurate phase is reconstructed by the $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ distortion of the Ta layers. In contrast, the out-of-plane response is governed by a quasi-one-dimensional, Peierls-like dimerization of the two-dimensional star-of-David layers. Our results identify this dimerization as the dominant mechanism of the metal-to-insulator transition in both directions, ruling out a significant role of electronic correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful new framework for classifying and simulating correlated and topological phases of quantum matter. Their central premise is that strongly correlated matter can only be understood by studying the underlying entanglement structure and its associated (generalised) symmetries. In essence, tensor networks provide a compressed, holographic description of the complicated vacuum fluctuations in strongly correlated systems, and as such they break down the infamous many-body exponential wall. These lecture notes provide a concise overview of the most important conceptual, computational and mathematical aspects of this theory.</description>

      <title>Continuum-Field-Theoretical Construction of Conserved Currents, Non-Invertible Symmetries, and Mixed Anomalies in (3+1)D Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate generalized symmetries, with particular emphasis on non-invertible ones, in three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders hosting both particle- and loop-like excitations. We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \wedge a \wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnet (AM), a recently identified class of collinear magnet, has garnered significant attention due to its unique combination of zero net magnetization and spin-split energy bands, leading to a variety of novel physical phenomena. Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, collinear magnets are classified as even-wave magnets, i.e., either ferro-, antiferro-, or altermagnets. It is based on the belief that collinear magnets always feature an inversion-symmetric band structure, which forbids odd-wave magnetism. Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature. We propose minimal models based on the coexistence of AFM order with compensated loop current orders for all types of collinear magnets. Our work provides a new perspective on collinear magnets and the spin-space group classification.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic orders and excitations in a half-filled Hubbard model that continuously interpolates between the Lieb and kagome lattices. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation combined with real-time two-particle response functions from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the random phase approximation, we map the $U-t'$ phase diagram of the Lieb-kagome lattices, identifying the typical magnetic states and the corresponding magnetic excitation spectra. In addition to gapless Goldstone magnons, the ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken phases also exhibit gapped Higgs magnon bands, which originate from amplitude fluctuations in the order parameter characterizing spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite-temperature canonical-ensemble determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that enforces an exact fermion number and enables stable simulations of correlated lattice fermions. We propose a stabilized QR update that reduces the computational complexity from standard cubic scaling $O(\beta N^3)$ to linear scaling $O(\beta N N_e^2)$ with respect to the system size $N$, where $N_e$ is the particle number. This yields a dramatic speedup in dilute regimes ($N_e \ll N$), opening unbiased access to large-scale simulations of strongly correlated low-density phases. We validate the method on the dilute Fermi gas with onsite Hubbard interactions, observing the suppression of the fermion sign problem in the dilute limit. Furthermore, we apply this approach to an one-dimensional flat-band system, where the canonical ensemble allows for precise control over filling. We reveal a ferromagnetic instability at low temperatures in the half-filling regime. Our linear-scaling approach provides a powerful tool for investigating emergent phenomena in dilute quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transitions in one-dimensional correlated Fermi gases with cavity-induced umklapp scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.08368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superradiant phase transitions of one-dimensional correlated Fermi gases in a transversely driven optical cavity, under the umklapp condition that the cavity wave number is equal to two times the Fermi wave number, are studied with bosonization and renormalization group techniques. The bosonization of Fermi fields gives rise to an all-to-all sine-Gordon (SG) model due to the cavity-assisted nonlocal interactions, where the Bose fields at any two spatial points are coupled. The superradiant phase transition is then mapped to the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition of the all-to-all SG model. The nesting effect, in which the superradiant phase transition can be triggered by an infinitely small atom-cavity coupling strength, is shown to be preserved for any nonattractive local interactions. For attractive local interactions, the phase transition occurs at a finite critical coupling strength. Nevertheless, the analysis of the scaling dimension indicates that the perturbation of the nonlocal cosine term is indeed relevant (irrelevant) when the scaling dimension is lower (higher) than the critical dimension, similar to the case of an ordinary local SG model. Our work provides an analytical framework for understanding the superradiant phase transitions in low-dimensional correlated intracavity Fermi gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the eigenstate properties of quantum systems is a long-standing, challenging problem for both classical and quantum computing. Existing universal quantum algorithms typically rely on ideal and efficient query models (e.g. time evolution operator or block encoding of the Hamiltonian), which, however, become suboptimal for actual implementation at the quantum circuit level. Here, we present a full-stack design of quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenenergy and eigenstate properties, which can achieve high precision and good scaling with system size. The gate complexity per circuit for estimating generic Hamiltonians' eigenstate properties is $\tilde{O} (\log \varepsilon^{-1})$, which has a logarithmic dependence on the inverse precision $\varepsilon$. For lattice Hamiltonians, the circuit depth of our design achieves near-optimal system-size scaling, even with local qubit connectivity. Our full-stack algorithm has low overhead in circuit compilation, which thus results in a small actual gate count (CNOT and non-Clifford gates) for lattice and molecular problems compared to advanced eigenstate algorithms. The algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum devices using up to 2,000 two-qubit gates and 20,000 single-qubit gates, and achieves high-precision eigenenergy estimation for Heisenberg-type Hamiltonians, demonstrating its noise robustness.</description>

      <title>Unveiling pressurized bulk superconductivity in a trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has provided new perspectives on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase, so the discovery of new superconducting RP nickelates is highly desirable to reveal their generality. Here we report that high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal is grown with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure. High-pressure transport measurements show that the superconducting state arises above 10 GPa, and the maximum Tc reaches 39 K without saturation, significantly exceeding the value of 25-30 K of La4Ni3O10. Ultrasensitive d.c. magnetic susceptibility measurements under high pressure indicate bulk superconductivity with appreciable superconducting volume fractions. By performing in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 16 K, a structural transition is found from monoclinic to tetragonal. Unlike La4Ni3O10, the electronic structure of the high-pressure phase of Pr4Ni3O10 from density functional theory exhibits a dramatic metallization of the sigma-bonding band consisting of three dz2 orbitals and van Hove singularity of coupled bands of dx2-y2 orbitals near the Fermi level, similar to the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. These findings reveal some generic features of both crystal and electronic structures for high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates and multi-layer cuprates.</description>

      <title>On dimensions of (2+1)D abelian bosonic topological systems on non-orientable manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a framework to describe abelian bosonic topological systems with parity symmetry on a torus in terms of the projective representation of $GL(2,\mathbb{Z})$. However, this information alone does not guarantee that we can assign Hilbert spaces to non-orientable surfaces in a way compatible with the gluing axiom of topological quantum field theory. Here, we show that we may assign Hilbert spaces with integer dimensions to non-orientable surfaces in the case of abelian bosonic topological systems with time-reversal symmetry, which can be seen as a necessary condition for the existence of topological quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant protocols through spacetime concatenation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While significant attention has been devoted to studying entanglement in photonic systems, solid-state spin lattices remain relatively underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we investigate the entanglement structure of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic chains composed of alternating spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 particles. We characterize the ground-state correlations using exact diagonalization and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Although the bipartite entanglement is restricted to nearest neighbors, we reveal the presence of long-range genuine multipartite entanglement between spatially separated spin pairs. These findings advance our understanding of quantum correlations in ferrimagnetic materials. The micromagnon description allows to provide fast approximation of ground states of ferrimagnets and emphasizes presence of multipartite correlations not widely discussed thus far.</description>

      <title>Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in $(2+1)$D abelian bosonic topological phases. Time-reversal anomalies in such systems are classified by $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in $(3+1)$D, and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as $\mathbb{RP}^4$ and $\mathbb{CP}^2$. These partition functions are related by the anomaly formula \begin{equation*}
  Z(\mathbb{RP}^4)\, Z(\mathbb{CP}^2) = \theta_{\mathcal{M}}, \end{equation*} where $\theta_\mathcal{M}$ is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges $\xi_n$, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation $Z(\mathbb{CP}^2) = \xi_1$, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula that involves both the higher central charges $\xi_n$ and a new time-reversal invariant $\eta_n$. Introducing a distinguished subset $\mathcal{M}^n \subset \mathcal{A}$ of anyons, we establish the relation \begin{equation*}
  \eta_n \cdot \xi_n = \frac{\sum_{a \in \mathcal{M}^n} \theta(a)^n}{\left| \sum_{a \in \mathcal{M}^n} \theta(a)^n \right|}, \end{equation*} which generalizes the known anomaly formula.
  We analyze the algebraic structure of $\mathcal{M}^n$, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, a global symmetry acting on them is generally realized in a projective manner. Symmetry fractionalization encodes this projective realization. The obstruction to defining symmetry fractionalization is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose nontriviality signals a failure to define symmetry fractionalization consistently. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.</description>

      <title>Energy density driven ultrafast electronic excitations in a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials requires ultrafast probes with spectral selectivity. We report femtosecond reflectivity measurements on the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ using free-electron laser extreme-ultraviolet (23.5--177~eV) and near-infrared (1.5~eV) pump pulses. EUV pulses access deep electronic states, while NIR light excites valence-band transitions. Despite these distinct channels, both schemes produce nearly identical dynamics: above $T_c$, excitations relax through fast (100--300~fs) and slower (1--5~ps) channels; below $T_c$, a delayed component signals quasiparticle recombination and condensate recovery. We find that when electronic excitations are involved, the ultrafast response is governed mainly by absorbed energy rather than by the microscopic nature of the excitation. In contrast, bosonic driving in the THz or mid-infrared produces qualitatively different dynamics. By demonstrating that EUV excitation of a correlated superconductor yields macroscopic dynamics converging with those from optical pumping, this work defines a new experimental paradigm: FEL pulses at core-level energies provide a powerful means to probe and control nonequilibrium electronic states in quantum materials on their intrinsic femtosecond timescales. This establishes FEL-based EUV pumping as a new capability for ultrafast materials science, opening routes toward soft X-ray and attosecond studies of correlated dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orders, to be realized in a two dimensional ferromagnetic superconductor, is proposed obeying necessary symmetry principles. This interaction allows us to formulate a duality, similar to the Boson-vortex duality in 2+1 dimensional superfluid. In the dual theory the Skyrmion and the vortex excitations interact with each other via an emergent gauge field. The static interaction potential is attractive for a Skyrmion and a vortex with opposite topological charges. This interaction can lead to formation of bound pairs of the mentioned topological excitations. Furthermore, we argue that such pairing implies that a Magnus force acting on the vortex induces a transverse, Hall-like drift motion of the Skyrmion, which we term the vortex-drag induced Skyrmion Hall effect. Possible experimental manifestations of this effect are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficient Calculation of the Maximal R\'{e}nyi Divergence for a Matrix Product State via Generalized Eigenvalue Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum and classical correlations between subsystems is fundamental to understanding many-body physics. In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\left(A;B\right)=S\left(\rho_{A}\right)+S\left(\rho_{B}\right)-S\left(\rho_{AB}\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on R\'{e}nyi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal R\'{e}nyi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal R\'enyi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information.</description>

      <title>Construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states in the SU($N$) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</description>

Abstract: A recent STM experiment in 2D bilayer graphene [Y.-C. Tsui, et al., Nature 628, 287 (2024)], under a strong perpendicular magnetic field, has made a direct observation of the existence of three distinct filling-factor-dependent quantum phases in the lowest Landau level: the incompressible fractional quantum Hall liquid, a crystalline compressible hexagonal Wigner crystal with long-range order and rotational symmetry-breaking, and a random localized solid phase with no spatial order. We argue that the spatially random localized phase at low filling is the recently proposed disorder-dominated strongly localized amorphous "Anderson solid" phase [A. Babber, et al., arXiv:2601.03521], which appears generically at a sample-dependent filling factor.</description>
