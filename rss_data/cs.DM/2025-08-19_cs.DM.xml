      <title>Tightening the mixed integer linear formulation for the piecewise linear approximation in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09395v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tightening the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) approximations of data sets in arbitrary dimensions. The MILP formulation leverages the difference-of-convex (DC) representation of CPWL functions. We introduce the concept of well-behaved CPWL interpolations and demonstrate that any CPWL interpolation of a data set has a well-behaved version. This result is critical to tighten the MILP problem. We present six different strategies to tighten the problem, which include fixing the values of some variables, introducing additional constraints, identifying small big-M parameter values and applying tighter variable bounds. These methods leverage key aspects of the DC representation and the inherent structure of well-behaved CPWL interpolations. Experimental results demonstrate that specific combinations of these tightening strategies lead to significant improvement in solution times, especially for tightening strategies that consider well-behaved CPWL solutions.</description>

      <title>Queen Domination by SAT Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The queen domination problem asks for the minimum number of queens needed to attack all squares on an $n\times n$ chessboard. Once this optimal number is known, determining the number of distinct solutions up to isomorphism has also attracted considerable attention. Previous work has introduced specialized and highly optimized search procedures to address open instances of the problem. While efficient in terms of runtime, these approaches have not provided proofs that can be independently verified by third-party checkers. In contrast, this paper aims to combine efficiency with verifiability. We reduce the problem to a propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) using a straightforward encoding, and solve the resulting formulas with modern SAT solvers capable of generating proof certificates. By improving the SAT encoding with a novel literal ordering strategy, and leveraging established techniques such as static symmetry breaking and the Cube-and-Conquer paradigm, this paper achieves both performance and trustworthiness. Our approach discovers and corrects a discrepancy in previous results for $n=16$ and resolves the previously open case $n=19$.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Perspective on Uniquely Restricted Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph G, a matching is a subset of edges of G that do not share an endpoint. A matching M is uniquely restricted if the subgraph induced by the endpoints of the edges of M has exactly one perfect matching. Given a graph G and a positive integer \ell, Uniquely Restricted Matching asks whether G has a uniquely restricted matching of size at least \ell. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of Uniquely Restricted Matching under various parameters. Specifically, we show that Uniquely Restricted Matching admits a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm on line graphs when parameterized by the solution size. We also establish that the problem is FPT when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. Furthermore, we show that Uniquely Restricted Matching does not admit a polynomial kernel with respect to the vertex cover number plus the size of the matching unless NP \subseteq coNP/poly.</description>

      <title>Nucleation-free independent graphs with implied nonedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give inductive constructions of independent graphs that contain implied nonedges but do not contain any non-trivial rigid subgraphs, or \emph{nucleations}: some of the constructions and proofs apply to 3-dimensional abstract rigidity matroids with their respective definitions of nucleations and implied nonedges. The first motivation for the inductive constructions of this paper, which generate an especially intractable class of flexible circuits, is to illuminate further obstacles to settling Graver's maximality conjecture that the 3-dimensional generic rigidity matroid is isomorphic to Whiteley's cofactor matroid (the unique maximal matroid in which all graphs isomorphic to $K_5$ are circuits). While none of the explicit examples we provide refutes the maximality conjecture (since their properties hold in both matroids) the construction schemes are useful regardless whether the conjecture is true or false, e.g. for constructing larger (counter)examples from smaller ones. The second motivation is to make progress towards a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding independence in the abovementioned maximal matroid. Nucleation-free graphs with implied nonedges, such as the families constructed in this paper, are the key obstacles that must be dealt with for improving the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of constrained reconfiguration and motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13032v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.</description>

      <title>The Most Malicious Ma\^{i}tre D'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of the malicious ma\^{i}tre d' is introduced and solved by Peter Winkler in his book Mathematical Puzzles: A Connoisseur's Collection [1]. This problem is about a ma\^{i}tre d' seating diners around a table, trying to maximize the number of diners who don't get napkins. Along with this problem, Winkler introduces a variation called the adaptive ma\^{i}tre d' and presents a strategy. This problem was later investigated and a better strategy was discovered by Acton et al. [2]. We describe an even better strategy which we call ``long trap setting" and prove that it is optimal. We also derive a formula for the expected number of napkinless diners under our optimal strategy.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"odl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"iss\'e classes, and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <title>Prefix-bounded matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By unifying various earlier extensions of alternating sign matrices (ASMs), we introduce the notion of prefix-bounded matrices (PBMs). It is shown that the convex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special generalized polymatroids. This implies $\unicode{x2013}$ in a more general form $\unicode{x2013}$ that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight (2007) and by Striker (2007, 2009) for describing the polytope of alternating sign matrices is totally dual integral (TDI), confirming a recent conjecture of Edmonds (2024, 2025). By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a characterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting lower and upper bounds on their entries. Furthermore, we point out that the constraint matrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs, in particular ASMs, is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network-flow techniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural results on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually box-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs admits a sharpened form of the integer Carath\'eodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property. This latter feature makes it possible to confirm an extended form of an elegant conjecture of Brualdi and Dahl (2023) on the decomposability of a so-called $k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs.</description>

      <title>A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific "trigger" arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints. The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel costs.</description>
