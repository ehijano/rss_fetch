      <title>The Moran process on a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fixation probability for two versions of the Moran process on the random graph $G_{n,p}$ at the threshold for connectivity. The Moran process models the spread of a mutant population in a network. Throughtout the process there are vertices of two types, mutants and non-mutants. Mutants have fitness $s$ and non-mutants have fitness 1. The process starts with a unique individual mutant located at the vertex $v_0$. In the Birth-Death version of the process a random vertex is chosen proportional to its fitness and then changes the type of a random neighbor to its own. The process continues until the set of mutants $X$ is empty or $[n]$. In the Death-Birth version a uniform random vertex is chosen and then takes the type of a random neighbor, chosen according to fitness. The process again continues until the set of mutants $X$ is empty or $[n]$. The {\em fixation probability} is the probability that the process ends with $X=\emptyset$.
  We give asymptotically correct estimates of the fixation probability that depend on degree of $v_0$ and its neighbors.,</description>

      <title>An exponential inequality for Hilbert-valued U-statistics of i.i.d. data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an exponential inequality for U-statistics of i.i.d. data, varying kernel and taking values in a separable Hilbert space. The bound are expressed as a sum of an exponential term plus an other one involving the tail of a sum of squared norms. We start by the degenerate case. Then we provide applications to U-statistics of not necessarily degenerate fixed kernel, weighted U-statistics and incomplete U-statistics.</description>

      <title>Local limit of the random degree constrained process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the random degree constrained process (a time-evolving random graph model with degree constraints) has a local weak limit, provided that the underlying host graphs are high degree almost regular. We, moreover, identify the limit object as a multi-type branching process, by combining coupling arguments with the analysis of a certain recursive tree process. Using a spectral characterization, we also give an asymptotic expansion of the critical time when the giant component emerges in the so-called random $d$-process, resolving a problem of Warnke and Wormald for large $d$.</description>

      <title>The largest fragment in self-similar fragmentation processes of positive index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Take a self-similar fragmentation process with dislocation measure $\nu$ and index of self-similarity $\alpha &gt; 0$. Let $e^{-m_t}$ denote the size of the largest fragment in the system at time $t\geq 0$. We prove fine results for the asymptotics of the stochastic process $(s_{t \geq 0}$ for a broad class of dislocation measures. In the case where the process has finite activity (i.e.\ $\nu$ is a finite measure with total mass $\lambda&gt;0$), we show that setting \begin{equation*} g(t) :=\frac{1}{\alpha}\left(\log t - \log \log t + \log(\alpha \lambda)\right), \qquad t\geq 0, \end{equation*} we have $\lim_{t \to \infty} (m_t - g(t)) = 0$ almost-surely. In the case where the process has infinite activity, we impose the mild regularity condition that the dislocation measure satisfies \begin{equation*} \nu(1-s_1 &gt; \delta ) = \delta^{-\theta} \ell(1/\delta), \end{equation*} for some $\theta \in (0,1)$ and $\ell:(0,\infty) \to (0,\infty)$ slowly varying at infinity. Under this regularity condition, we find that if \begin{equation*} g(t) :=\frac{1}{\alpha}\left( \log t - (1-\theta) \log \log t - \log \ell \left( \log t ~\ell\left( \log t \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\theta}} \right) + c(\alpha,\theta) \right), \qquad t\geq 0, \end{equation*} then $\lim_{t \to \infty} (m_t - g(t)) = 0$ almost-surely. Here $c(\alpha,\theta) := \log \alpha -(1-\theta)\log(1-\theta) - \log \Gamma(1-\theta)$. Our results sharpen significantly the best prior result on general self-similar fragmentation processes, due to Bertoin, which states that $m_t = (1+o(1)) \frac{1}{\alpha} \log t$.</description>

      <title>Total disconnectedness and percolation for the supports of super-tree random measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-tree random measure's (STRM's) were introduced by Allouba, Durrett, Hawkes and Perkins as a simple stochastic model which emulates a superprocess at a fixed time. A STRM $\nu$ arises as the a.s. limit of a sequence of empirical measures for a discrete time particle system which undergoes independent supercritical branching and independent random displacement (spatial motion) of children from their parents. We study the connectedness properties of the closed support of a STRM ($\mathrm{supp}(\nu)$) for a particular choice of random displacement. Our main results are distinct sufficient conditions for the a.s. total disconnectedness (TD) of $\mathrm{supp}(\nu)$, and for percolation on $\mathrm{supp}(\nu)$ which will imply a.s. existence of a non-trivial connected component in $\mathrm{supp}(\nu)$. We illustrate a close connection between a subclass of these STRM's and super-Brownian motion (SBM). For these particular STRM's the above results give a.s. TD of the support in three and higher dimensions and the existence of a non-trivial connected component in two dimensions, with the three-dimensional case being critical. The latter two-dimensional result assumes that $p_c(\mathbb{Z}^2)$, the critical probability for site percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, is less than $1-e^{-1}$. (There is strong numerical evidence supporting this condition although the known rigorous bounds fall just short.) This gives evidence that the same connectedness properties should hold for SBM. The latter remains an interesting open problem in dimensions $2$ and $3$ ever since it was first posed by Don Dawson over $30$ years ago.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of knowledge and the lottery society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lucas-Moll system is a mean-field game type model describing the growth of an economy by means of
  diffusion of knowledge. The individual agents in the economy advance their knowledge by learning from each other and via internal innovation. Their cumulative distribution function satisfies a forward in time nonlinear non-local reaction-diffusion type equation. On the other hand, the learning strategy of the agents is based on the solution to a backward in time nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation that is coupled to the aforementioned equation for the agents density. Together, these equations form a system of the mean-field game type. When the learning rate is sufficiently large, existence of balanced growth path solutions to the Lucas-Moll system was proved in~\cite{PRV,Porretta-Rossi}. Here, we analyze a complementary regime where the balanced growth paths do not exist. The main result is a long time convergence theorem. Namely, the solution to the initial-terminal value problem behaves in such a way that at large times an overwhelming majority of the agents spend no time producing at all and are only learning. In particular, the agents density propagates at the Fisher-KPP speed. We name this type of solutions a lottery society.</description>

      <title>Local large deviations for randomly forced nonlinear wave equations with localized damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large deviation principle (LDP) for locally damped nonlinear wave equations perturbed by a bounded noise. When the noise is sufficiently non-degenerate, we establish the LDP for empirical distributions with lower bound of a local type. The primary challenge is the lack of compactness due to the absence of smoothing effect. This is overcome by exploiting the asymptotic compactness for the dynamics of waves, introducing the concept of asymptotic exponential tightness for random measures, and establishing a new LDP approach for random dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>An approximation of the squared Wasserstein distance and an application to Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a simple $C^{1,1}$ approximation of the squared Wasserstein distance on R^d when one of the two measures is fixed. This approximation converges locally uniformly. More importantly, at points where the differential of the squared Wasserstein distance exists, it attracts the differentials of the approximations at nearby points. Our method relies on the Hilbertian lifting of PL Lions and on the regularization in Hilbert spaces of Lasry and Lions. We then provide an application of this result by using it to establish a comparison principle for an Hamilton-Jacobi equation on the set of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Abelian and stochastic sandpile models on complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the sandpile model, vertices of a graph are allocated grains of sand. At each unit of time, a grain is added to a randomly chosen vertex. If that causes its number of grains to exceed its degree, that vertex is called unstable, and topples. In the Abelian sandpile model (ASM), topplings are deterministic, whereas in the stochastic sandpile model (SSM) they are random. We study the ASM and SSM on complete bipartite graphs. For the SSM, we provide a stochastic version of Dhar's burning algorithm to check if a given (stable) configuration is recurrent or not, with linear complexity. We also exhibit a bijection between sorted recurrent configurations and pairs of compatible Ferrers diagrams. We then provide a similar bijection for the ASM, and also interpret its recurrent configurations in terms of labelled Motzkin paths.</description>

      <title>Cyclicity Analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider an $N$-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process satisfying the linear stochastic differential equation $d\mathbf x(t) = - \mathbf B\mathbf x(t) dt + \boldsymbol \Sigma d \mathbf w(t).$ Here, $\mathbf B$ is a fixed $N \times N$ circulant friction matrix whose eigenvalues have positive real parts, $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is a fixed $N \times M$ matrix. We consider a signal propagation model governed by this OU process. In this model, an underlying signal propagates throughout a network consisting of $N$ linked sensors located in space. We interpret the $n$-th component of the OU process as the measurement of the propagating effect made by the $n$-th sensor. The matrix $\mathbf B$ represents the sensor network structure: if $\mathbf B$ has first row $(b_1 \ , \ \dots \ , \ b_N),$ where $b_1&gt;0$ and $b_2 \ , \ \dots \ ,\ b_N \le 0,$ then the magnitude of $b_p$ quantifies how receptive the $n$-th sensor is to activity within the $(n+p-1)$-th sensor. Finally, the $(m,n)$-th entry of the matrix $\mathbf D = \frac{\boldsymbol \Sigma \boldsymbol \Sigma^\text T}{2}$ is the covariance of the component noises injected into the $m$-th and $n$-th sensors. For different choices of $\mathbf B$ and $\boldsymbol \Sigma,$ we investigate whether Cyclicity Analysis enables us to recover the structure of network. Roughly speaking, Cyclicity Analysis studies the lead-lag dynamics pertaining to the components of a multivariate signal. We specifically consider an $N \times N$ skew-symmetric matrix $\mathbf Q,$ known as the lead matrix, in which the sign of its $(m,n)$-th entry captures the lead-lag relationship between the $m$-th and $n$-th component OU processes. We investigate whether the structure of the leading eigenvector of $\mathbf Q,$ the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf Q$ in modulus, reflects the network structure induced by $\mathbf B.$</description>

Abstract: The aim of this lecture is to give an overview of old and new resultson Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson (BGW) trees. After introducing the framework of discretetrees, we first give alternative proofs of classical results on theextinction probability of BGW processes and on thedescription of the processes conditioned on extinction or onnon-extinction. Then, we study recent  local limits of critical orsub-critical BGW trees conditioned to be large.</description>

Abstract: The renewal contact process, introduced in $2019$ by Fontes, Marchetti, Mountford, and Vares, extends the Harris contact process in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ by allowing the possible cure times to be determined according to independent renewal processes (with some interarrival distribution $\mu$) and keeping the transmission times determined according to independent exponential times with a fixed rate $\lambda$. We investigate sufficient conditions on $\mu$ to have a process with a finite critical value $\lambda_c$ for any spatial dimension $d \geq 1$. In particular, we show that $\lambda_c$ is finite when $\mu$ is continuous with bounded support or when $\mu$ is absolutely continuous and has a decreasing hazard rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of a diffusion process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ advected by a stationary random vector field which is assumed to be divergence-free, dihedrally symmetric in law and have a log-correlated potential. A special case includes $\nabla^\perp$ of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions. We show the variance of the diffusion process at a large time $t$ behaves like $2 c_* t (\log t)^{1/2}$, in a quenched sense and with a precisely determined, universal prefactor constant $c_*&gt;0$. We also prove a quenched invariance principle under this superdiffusive scaling. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalization group argument in which we inductively analyze coarse-grained diffusivities, scale-by-scale. Our analysis leads to sharp homogenization and large-scale regularity estimates on the infinitesimal generator, which are subsequently transferred into quantitative information on the process.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group and elliptic homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate on the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio~$\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound applies to high-contrast elliptic equations demonstrating near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show that, given a suitable decay of correlation, the length scale at which homogenization is observed is at most $\exp(C \log^3(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation -- and thus the strength of the disorder -- after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we obtain an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach can be interpreted as a rigorous renormalization group argument and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Selection Problem Associated with the Poisson Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15616v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cowan and Zabczyk (1978) introduced a continuous-time generalisation of the secretary problem, where offers arrive at epochs of a homogeneous Poisson process. We expand their work to encompass the last-success problem under the Karamata-Stirling success profile. In this setting, the $k$th trial is a success with probability $p_k=\theta/(\theta+k-1)$, where $\theta &gt; 0$. In the best-choice setting ($\theta=1$), the myopic strategy is optimal, and the proof hinges on verifying the monotonicity of certain critical roots. We extend this crucial result to the last-success case by exploiting a connection to the sign of the derivative in the first parameter of a quotient of Kummer's hypergeometric functions. Additionally, we establish an Edmundson-Madansky inequality applicable to Poisson random variables. This result enables us to adopt a probabilistic approach to derive bounds and asymptotics of the critical roots. This strengthens and improves the findings of Ciesielski and Zabczyk (1979).</description>

      <title>Malliavin calculus on the Clifford algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with Malliavin calculus on the $L^2$ space of the $W^*$-algebra generated by fermion fields (the Clifford algebra). First, we verify the product formula for multiple integrals in It\^o-Clifford calculus, which is It\^o calculus on the Clifford algebra. Using this product formula, we can define the derivation operator and the divergence operator. Anti-symmetric Malliavin calculus thus constructed has properties similar to those of usual Malliavin calculus. The derivation operator and the divergence operator satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations, and the divergence operator serves as an extension of the It\^o-Clifford stochastic integral, satisfying the Clark-Ocone formula. Subsequently, using this calculus, we consider the concentration inequality, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and the fourth-moment theorem. As for the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, only a weaker result is obtained. On the other hand, as for the concentration inequality, we obtain results that are almost similar to those of the usual case; moreover, the results concerning the fourth-moment theorem imply that, unlike in the case of the usual Brownian motion, convergence in distribution cannot be deduced from the convergence of the fourth moment.</description>

      <title>Elliptic homogenization from qualitative to quantitative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained introduction to the theory of elliptic homogenization for random coefficient fields, starting from classical qualitative homogenization. The presentation also contains new results, such as optimal estimates (both in terms of stochastic moments and scaling of the error) for coefficient fields which are local functions of Gaussian random fields.</description>

      <title>Strategy Complexity of Limsup and Liminf Threshold Objectives in Countable MDPs, with Applications to Optimal Expected Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a countably infinite number of states. The $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) threshold objective is to maximize the probability that the $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) of the infinite sequence of directly seen rewards is non-negative. We establish the complete picture of the strategy complexity of these objectives, i.e., the upper and lower bounds on the memory required by $\varepsilon$-optimal (resp. optimal) strategies. We then apply these results to solve two open problems from (Sudderth, Decisions in Economics and Finance, 2020) about the strategy complexity of optimal strategies for the expected $\limsup$ (resp. $\liminf$) payoff.</description>

      <title>Kernel Stein Discrepancy on Lie Groups: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12551v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributional approximation is a fundamental problem in machine learning with numerous applications across all fields of science and engineering and beyond. The key challenge in most approximation methods is the need to tackle the intractable normalization constant pertaining to the parametrized distributions used to model the data. In this paper, we present a novel Stein operator on Lie groups leading to a kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) which is a normalization-free loss function. We present several theoretical results characterizing the properties of this new KSD on Lie groups and its minimizers namely, the minimum KSD estimator (MKSDE). Proof of several properties of MKSDE are presented, including strong consistency, CLT and a closed form of the MKSDE for the von Mises-Fisher distribution on SO(N). Finally, we present experimental evidence depicting advantages of minimizing KSD over maximum likelihood estimation.</description>

      <title>An entropy penalized approach for stochastic control problems. Complete version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an original approach to stochastic control problems. We consider a weak formulation that is written as an optimization (minimization) problem on the space of probability measures. We then introduce a penalized version of this problem obtained by splitting the minimization variables and penalizing the discrepancy   between the two variables via an  entropy term.  We show that the penalized problem provides a good approximation of  the original problem when the weight of the entropy  penalization term is large enough. Moreover, the penalized problem  has the advantage of giving rise to two optimization subproblems that are easy to solve in each of the two optimization  variables when the other is fixed. We take advantage of this property to propose an alternating optimization procedure that converges to the infimum of the penalized problem with a rate $O(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations.  The relevance of this approach is illustrated by solving a high-dimensional stochastic control problem aimed at controlling consumption in electrical systems.</description>

      <title>Computationally efficient reductions between some statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximately transforming a sample from a source statistical model to a sample from a target statistical model without knowing the parameters of the source model, and construct several computationally efficient such reductions between canonical statistical experiments. In particular, we provide computationally efficient procedures that approximately reduce uniform, Erlang, and Laplace location models to general target families. We illustrate our methodology by establishing nonasymptotic reductions between some canonical high-dimensional problems, spanning mixtures of experts, phase retrieval, and signal denoising. Notably, the reductions are structure-preserving and can accommodate missing data. We also point to a possible application in transforming one differentially private mechanism to another.</description>

      <title>A Fisher-Rao gradient flow for entropic mean-field min-max games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient flows play a substantial role in addressing many machine learning problems. We examine the convergence in continuous-time of a \textit{Fisher-Rao} (Mean-Field Birth-Death) gradient flow in the context of solving convex-concave min-max games with entropy regularization. We propose appropriate Lyapunov functions to demonstrate convergence with explicit rates to the unique mixed Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Proof of Zamolodchikov conjecture for semi-classical conformal blocks on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1986, Zamolodchikov conjectured an exponential structure for the semi-classical limit of conformal blocks on a sphere. This paper provides a rigorous proof of the analog of Zamolodchikov conjecture for Liouville conformal blocks on a one-punctured torus, using their probabilistic construction and show the existence of a positive radius of convergence of the semi-classical limit. As a consequence, we obtain a closed form expression for the solution of the Lam\'e equation, and show a relation between its accessory parameter and the classical action of the non-autonomous elliptic Calogero-Moser model evaluated at specific values of the solution.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamical Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Overparameterized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as the ones found in modern machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent which depends on the local dynamics around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global minimum.</description>
