      <title>Ternary Associativity and Ternary Lie Algebra at Cube Root of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to extending the notion of commutator and Lie algebra to algebras with ternary multiplication laws. Our approach is based on ternary associativity of the first and second kind. We propose a ternary commutator, which is a linear combination of six (all permutations of three elements) triple products. The coefficients of this linear combination are the cube roots of unity. We find an identity for the ternary commutator that holds due to ternary associativity of the first or second kind. The form of the found identity is determined by the permutations of the general affine group GA(1,5). We consider the found identity as an analogue of the Jacobi identity in the ternary case. We introduce the concept of a ternary Lie algebra at the cubic root of unity and give examples of such an algebra constructed using ternary multiplications of rectangular and three-dimensional matrices. We point out the connection between the structure constants of a ternary Lie algebra with three generators and an irreducible representation of the rotation group.</description>

      <title>Deformation maps of Quasi-twilled associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two types of deformation maps of quasi-twilled associative algebras. Each type of deformation maps unify various operators on associative algebras. Right deformation maps unify modified Rota-Baxter operators of weight $\lambda$, derivations, homomorphisms and crossed homomorphisms. Left deformation maps unify relative Rota-Baxter operators of weight 0, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators and deformation maps of matched pairs of associative algebras. Furthermore, we give the controlling algebra and the cohomology of these two types of deformation maps. On the one hand, we obtain some existing results for modified Rota-Baxter operators of weight $\lambda$, derivations, homomorphisms, crossed homomorphisms, relative Rota-Baxter operators of weight 0, twisted Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds operators. On the other hand, we also obtain some new results, such as the controlling algebra of a modified Rota-Baxter operator of weight $\lambda$ on an associative algebra, the controlling algebra and the cohomology of a deformation map of a matched pair of associative algebras.</description>

      <title>Admissible groups over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a field K, one may ask which finite groups are Galois groups of field extensions L/K such that L is a maximal subfield of a division algebra with center K. This connection between inverse Galois theory and division algebras was first explored by Schacher in the 1960s. In this manuscript we consider this problem when K is a number field. For the case when L/K is assumed to be tamely ramified, we give a complete classification of number fields for which every solvable Sylow-metacyclic group is admissible, extending J. Sonn's result over the field of rational numbers. For the case when L/K is allowed to be wildly ramified, we give a characterization of admissible groups over several classes of number fields, and partial results in other cases.</description>

      <title>Cardinality of groups and rings via the idempotency of infinite cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important classical result in ZFC asserts that every infinite cardinal number is idempotent. Using this fact, we obtain several algebraic results in this article. The first result asserts that an infinite Abelian group has a proper subgroup with the same cardinality if and only if it is not a Pr\"ufer group. In the second result, the cardinality of any monoid-ring $R[M]$ (not necessarily commutative) is calculated. In particular, the cardinality of every polynomial ring with any number of variables (possibly infinite) is easily computed. Next, it is shown that every commutative ring and its total ring of fractions have the same cardinality. This set-theoretic observation leads us to a notion in ring theory that we call a balanced ring (i.e. a ring that is canonically isomorphic to its total ring of fractions). Every zero-dimensional ring is a balanced ring. Then we show that a Noetherian ring is a balanced ring if and only if its localization at every maximal ideal has zero depth. It is also proved that every self-injective ring (injective as a module over itself) is a balanced ring.</description>

      <title>Based cluster algebras of infinite ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend based cluster algebras to infinite ranks. By extending (quantum) cluster algebras associated with double Bott-Samelson cells, we recover infinite rank cluster algebras arising from representations of (shifted) quantum affine algebras. As the main application, we show that the fundamental variables of the cluster algebras associated with double Bott-Samelson cells could be computed via a braid group action when the Cartan matrix is of finite type. We also obtain the result A=U for the associated infinite rank (quantum) cluster algebras. Additionally, several conjectures regarding quantum virtual Grothendieck rings by Jang-Lee-Oh and Oh-Park follow as consequences. Finally, we quantize cluster algebras arising from representations of shifted quantum affine algebras.</description>
