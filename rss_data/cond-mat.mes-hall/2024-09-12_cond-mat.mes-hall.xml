      <title>Tuning Charged Localized Excitons in Monolayer WSe2 via Coupling to a Relaxor Ferroelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of single photon emitters (SPEs) in two-dimensional (2D) layered materials has greatly inspired numerous studies towards utilizing the system for quantum science and technology. Thus, the dynamic control of SPEs, including neutral and charged emitters, is highly desirable. In addition to the electric control, strain tuning is particularly attractive for the 2D materials since it can activate SPEs which are formed upon localizing free excitons. While strain engineering has been demonstrated for free and neutral localized excitons, few were shown on charged localized excitons which require an additional gate control. In this article, we show the strain-tunable charged localized excitons by transferring a top-gated monolayer semiconductor on a relaxor ferroelectric. Importantly, we unveil an enhanced interaction between the localized oscillating dipoles and the nanodomains. We further demonstrate the strain-dependent circular polarization and tunable rates of energy shifts under a magnetic field. Our results imply that the integration of 2D materials with relaxor ferroelectrics provides a rich platform for nanophotonics and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Spin-hydrodynamics of electrons in graphene and thermovortical magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the framework of relativistic spin-hydrodynamics in the context of electron hydrodynamics in graphene. We develop a spin-hydrodynamic model for a (2 + 1)-dimensional system of fermions under the condition of small spin polarization. Our analysis confirms that thermal vorticity, which satisfies the global equilibrium condition, is also a solution to the spin-hydrodynamic equations. Additionally, we calculate the magnetization of the system in global equilibrium and introduce a novel phenomenon - thermovortical magnetization - resulting from thermal vorticity, which can be experimentally observed in graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero energy eigenstates $\psi_0(\theta)$ of the twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonian at the Dirac point show a high sensitivity to the twist angle $\theta$ near the magic angles where the effective Fermi velocity vanishes. We use information theory markers, like fidelity-susceptibility and entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix to the layer sector, to capture this quantum criticality of zero modes at magic twist angles.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion crystal phase on a magnetic domain wall in chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic phase in chiral magnets in two dimensions with an in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and an out-of-plane Zeeman magnetic field, and find a chiral soliton lattice (spiral) phase beside a ferromegnetic phase inside the domain line, where the former represents a domain-wall skyrmion crystal from the bulk point of view. We first determine the phase diagram on the domain wall by numerically constructing domain wall solutions. We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Edge States with Hidden Topology in Spinner Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries -- whether explicit, latent, or hidden -- are fundamental to understanding topological materials. This work introduces a prototypical spring-mass model that extends beyond established canonical models, revealing topological edge states with distinct profiles at opposite edges. These edge states originate from hidden symmetries that become apparent only in deformation coordinates, as opposed to the conventional displacement coordinates used for bulk-boundary correspondence. Our model realized through the intricate connectivity of a spinner chain, demonstrates experimentally distinct edge states at opposite ends. By extending this framework to two dimensions, we explore the conditions required for such edge waves and their hidden symmetry in deformation coordinates. We also show that these edge states are robust against disorders that respect the hidden symmetry. This research paves the way for advanced material designs with tailored boundary conditions and edge state profiles, offering potential applications in fields such as photonics, acoustics, and mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the third-order anomalous Hall effect: from clean to disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third-order anomalous Hall effect (TOAHE) driven by Berry connection polarizability in Dirac materials offers a promising avenue for exploring quantum geometric phenomena. We investigate the role of impurity scattering on TOAHE using the semiclassical Boltzmann framework, via a comparison of the intrinsic contributions (stemming from the Berry connection polarizability effect) with the extrinsic contributions caused by the disorder. To validate our theoretical findings, we employ a generalized two-dimensional low-energy Dirac model to analytically assess the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the TOAHE. Our analysis reveals distinct disorder-mediated effects, including skew scattering and side jump contributions. We also elucidate their intriguing dependencies on Fermi surface anisotropy and discuss opportunities for experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between topological Majorana and trivial zero modes via transport and shot noise study in an altermagnet heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport and shot noise properties of a one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling~(SOC) placed in closed proximity to a bulk $s$-wave superconductor and an altermagnet with $d$-wave symmetry. Such heterostructure with vanishing net magnetization manifests itself as an alternative route to anchor Majorana zero modes~(MZMs) characterized by appropriate topological index~(winding number $W$). Interestingly, this system also hosts accidental zero modes~(AZMs) emerged with vanishing topological index indicating their non-topological nature. Furthermore, by incorporating three terminal setup, we explore the transport and shot noise signatures of these zero modes. At zero temperature, we obtain zero bias peak (ZBP) in differential conductance to be quantized with value $|W|\times 2 e^{2}/h$ for MZMs. On the other hand, AZMs exhibit non-quantized value at zero bias. Moreover, zero temperature shot noise manifests negative~(positive) value for MZMs~(AZMs) within the bulk gap. At finite temperature, shot noise exhibits negative value~(negative to positive transition) concerning MZMs~(AZMs). Thus, the obtained signatures clearly distinguish between the MZMs and non-topological AZMs. We extend our analysis by switching on the next to nearest neighbour hopping amplitude and SOC. Our conclusion remains unaffected for this case as well. Hence, our work paves the way to differentiate between emergent MZMs and AZMs in a semiconductor/ superconductor/ altermagnet heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Surface photoelectric effect by twisted photons as a source of twisted electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of surface photoelectric effect by twisted photons is developed. The explicit expression for the probability to record a twisted photoelectron is derived. The conditions when the surface photoelectric effect can be used as a pure source of twisted electrons are found. It is shown that the lightly doped n-InSb crystal with interface without defects at temperatures lower than $2.5$ K satisfies these conditions. The Dirac and Weyl semimetals with electron chemical potential near the top of the Dirac cone obey these conditions at temperatures lower than $60$ K and can also be employed for design of pure sources of twisted electrons by the photoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Gate-defined flat-band charge carrier confinement in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) near the magic angle is an interesting platform to study correlated electronic phases. These phases are gate-tunable and are closely related to the presence of flat electronic bands, isolated by single-particle band gaps. This allows electrostatically controlled confinement of charge carriers in the flat bands to explore the interplay between confinement, band renormalisation, electron-electron interactions and the moir\'e superlattice, potentially revealing key mechanisms underlying these electronic phases. Here, we show gate-controlled flat-band charge carrier confinement in near-magic-angle tBLG, resulting in well-tunable Coulomb blockade resonances arising from the charging of electrostatically defined islands in tBLG. Coulomb resonance measurements allow to study magnetic field-induced quantum oscillations in the density of states of the source-drain reservoirs, providing insight into the gate-tunable Fermi surfaces of tBLG. Comparison with tight-binding calculations emphasises the importance of displacement-field-induced band renormalisation, which is crucial for future advanced gate-tunable quantum devices and circuits in tBLG.</description>

      <title>Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide: A two-particle system with classical chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an electron in a semiconductor gets excited to the conduction band the missing electron can be viewed as a positively charged particle, the hole. Due to the Coulomb interaction electrons and holes can form a hydrogen-like bound state called exciton. For cuprous oxide a Rydberg series up to high principle quantum numbers has been observed by Kazimierczuk et al. [Nature 514, 343 (2014)] with the extension of excitons up to the $\mu$m-range. In this region the correspondence principle should hold and quantum mechanics turn into classical dynamics. Due to the complex valence band structure of Cu$_2$O the classical dynamics deviates from a purely hydrogen-like behavior. The uppermost valence band in cuprous oxide splits into various bands resulting in a yellow and green exciton series. Since the system exhibits no spherical symmetry, the angular momentum is not conserved. Thus, the classical dynamics becomes non-integrable, resulting in the possibility of chaotic motion. Here we investigate the classical dynamics of the yellow and green exciton series in cuprous oxide for two-dimensional orbits in the symmetry planes as well as fully three-dimensional orbits. The analysis reveals substantial differences between the dynamics of the yellow and green exciton series. While it is mostly regular for the yellow series large regions in phase space with classical chaos do exist for the green exciton series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study spin pumping into a spin-nematic state in a junction system composed of a ferromagnetic insulator and a spin-nematic insulator, described by using the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. We analyze an increase of the Gilbert damping in ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) due to an interfacial exchange coupling within a mean-field theory based on the Schwinger boson method. We find that the two Schwinger bosons contribute in distinct ways to spin pumping. We report a detailed dependence of the spin pumping on a resonant frequency, a magnetic field, and an interface type.</description>

      <title>Comment on Room-temperature spontaneous superradiance from single diamond nanocrystals [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Multiple Majorana bound states and their resilience against disorder in planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are theoretically predicted to harbor zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) in a tunable two-dimensional geometry, at the two ends of the middle metallic channel. Here we show that three distinct topological superconducting regimes, governing the localization of the near-zero-energy MBS, appear in these planar Josephson junctions. The topologically-protected MBS appear near the narrow edges of the junction -- not only in the middle metallic channel but also in the superconducting leads which have widths similar to the values used in recent experiments. We incorporate random fluctuation in the chemical potential to investigate the influence of non-magnetic disorder on the localization of the MBS in different topological regimes and find that the MBS are quite robust against disorder because of the two-dimensional geometry. Interestingly, moderate amount of disorder reduces the splitting between the MBS pairs, possibly by minimizing the wave function overlap of the MBS. We also discuss the changes in the topological superconducting phases when the superconducting lead width is varied. Our results reveal a rich structure of the localization of topologically protected multiple MBS in experimentally-accessible planar Josephson junctions, and call for their experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Incipient quantum spin Hall insulator under strong correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To assess prior mean-field studies that the interacting Kane-Mele model supports a novel antiferromagnetic Chern insulating phase (AFCI) for a wide range of sublattice potentials, we analyze the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in the presence of a sublattice potential using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). Instead of an AFCI, we find that the ground state is a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator for intermediate values of the sublattice potential $\lambda_v$, albeit with a small gap. The QSH state gives way to a trivial band insulator as the sublattice potential increases beyond a critical value. Only at small sublattice potentials does the QSH state transition into a trivial Mott insulator with xy antiferromagnetic correlations. The QAH feature is only observed at high temperature. The QAH feature crosses over to an incipient QSH state when the topological gap stabilizes. Our work is consistent with the experimental observation that in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ as well as AB stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$, where QSH is consistently observed at even-integer filling over a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Long distance spin shuttling enabled by few-parameter velocity optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin qubit shuttling via moving conveyor-mode quantum dots in Si/SiGe offers a promising route to scalable miniaturized quantum computing. Recent modeling of dephasing via valley degrees of freedom and well disorder dictate a slow shutting speed which seems to limit errors to above correction thresholds if not mitigated. We increase the precision of this prediction, showing that typical errors for 10 $\mu$m shuttling at constant speed results in O(1) error, using fast, automatically differentiable numerics and including improved disorder modeling and potential noise ranges. However, remarkably, we show that these errors can be brought to well below fault-tolerant thresholds using trajectory shaping with very simple parametrization with as few as 4 Fourier components, well within the means for experimental in-situ realization, and without the need for targeting or knowing the location of valley near degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Engineering of Lattice Dynamics and Elastic Constants of 2D Layered Nanomaterials under Pressure</title>

Abstract: Interlayer coupling in two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials can provide us novel strategies to evoke their superior properties, such as the exotic flat bands and unconventional superconductivity of twisted layers, the formation of moir\'e excitons and related nontrivial topology. However, to accurately quantify interlayer potential and further measure elastic properties of 2D materials remains vague, despite significant efforts. Herein, the layer-dependent lattice dynamics and elastic constants of 2D nanomaterials have been systematically investigated via pressure-engineering strategy based on ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy. The shearing mode and layer-breathing Raman shifts of MoS2 with various thicknesses were analyzed by the linear chain model. Intriguingly, it was found that the layer-dependent d{\omega}/dP of shearing and breathing Raman modes display the opposite trends, quantitatively consistent with our molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. These results can be generalized to other van der Waals systems, and may shed light on the potential applications of 2D materials in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Controlled Growth of large area bilayer MoS$_2$ films on SiO$_2$ substrates by chemical vapour deposition technique</title>

Abstract: Bilayer (2L) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have the ability to host interlayer excitons, where electron and hole parts are spatially separated that leads to much longer lifetime as compared to direct excitons. This property can be utilized for the development of exciton-based logic devices, which are supposed to be superior in terms of energy efficiency and optical communication compatibility as compared to their electronic counterparts. However, obtaining uniformly thick bilayer epitaxial films with large area coverage is challenging. Here, we have engineered the flow pattern of the precursors over the substrate surface to obtain large area (mm2) covered strictly bilayer MoS$_2$ films on SiO$_2$ by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique without any plasma treatment of the substrate prior to the growth. Bilayer nature of these films is confirmed by Raman, low-frequency Raman, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photoluminescence (PL) studies. The uniformity of the film has been checked by Raman peak separation and PL intensity map. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals that crystalline and twisted bilayer islands coexist within the layer. Back gated field-effect transistor (FET) structures fabricated on the bilayers show on/off ratio of 10^6 and subthreshold swings (SS) of 2.5 V/Decade.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear charge and thermal transport properties induced by orbital magnetic moment in chiral crystal cobalt monosilicide</title>

Abstract: The existence of exotic singularities in momentum space, such as spin-1 excitations and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) fermions, has been discussed so far to explore unique phenomena in the nonmagnetic B20-type compounds. Meanwhile, the Nonlinear Thermo-Electric (NCTE) charge and thermal Hall effect, a response proportional to the cross product of the electric field and temperature gradient, is expected in this chiral material, yet remains unexplored in B20-type compounds. Here, based on $ab \ initio$ calculations and symmetry analysis, we quantitatively analyze the NCTE charge and thermal Hall effects in cobalt monosilicide, obtaining experimentally measurable values of NCTE charge and thermal Hall current along [111] direction, which is not expected for second-order current responses to the DC electric field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these significant responses are enhanced around RSW fermions and spin-1 excitations. Additionally, we clarify that the NCTE Hall effect is solely governed by orbital magnetic moments due to the cancellation of Berry curvature contributions in cubic chiral crystals.</description>

      <title>Large inverse Faraday effect for Rydberg states of free atoms and isolated donors in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the induction of magnetization in Rydberg systems by means of the inverse Faraday effect, and propose the appearance of the effect in two such systems, Rydberg atoms proper and shallow dopants in semiconductors. Rydberg atoms are characterized by a large orbital radius. This large radius gives such excited states a large angular moment, which when driven with circularly polarized light, translates to a large effective magnetic field. We calculate this effect to generate effective magnetic fields of $O(10\,\text{mT})\times\left( \frac{\omega}{1\,\text{THz}} \right)^{-1} \left( \frac{I}{10\,{W\,cm}^{-2}} \right)$ in Rydberg states of Rb and Cs for a $1\,\text{THz}$ beam of intensity $10\,\text{W}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. The magnitude of the effective magnetic field scales with the principal quantum number as $n^4$. Additionally, THz spectroscopy of phosphorus doped silicon reveals a large cross-section for excitation of shallow dopants to Rydberg-like states, which even for small $n$ can be driven similarly with circularly polarized light to produce even larger magnetization, with ${B}_{\text{eff}}$ which we estimate as $O(1\,\text{mT})$ for Si:P with the same beam parameters.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Device-Driven Screening of Sub-1-nm Thickness Oxide Semiconductors for Future CMOS Technology Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin oxide semiconductors with sub-1-nm thickness are promising building blocks for ultrascaled field-effect transistor (FET) applications due to their resilience against short-channel effects, high air stability, and potential for low-energy device operation. However, the n-type dominance of ultrathin oxide FET has hindered their integration into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which requires both n-and p-type devices. Here we develop an ab initio device-driven computational screening workflow to identify sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors for sub-5-nm FET applications. We demonstrate that ultrathin CaO2, CaO, and SrO are compatible with p-type device operations under both high-performance (HP) and low-power (LP) requirements specified by the International Technology Roadmap of Semiconductors (ITRS), thereby expanding the limited family of p-type oxide semiconductors. Notably, CaO and SrO emerge as the first-of-kind sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors capable of simultaneously meeting the ITRS HP and LP criteria for both n-and p-type devices. CaO and SrO FETs outperform many existing low-dimensional semiconductors, exhibiting scalability below 5-nm gate length. Our findings offer a pioneering effort in the ab initio, device-driven screening of sub-1-nm thickness oxide semiconductors, significantly broadening the material candidate pool for future CMOS technology nodes.</description>

Abstract: We present a protocol to generate enhanced non-linear responses of incident pulses in the density wave phase within the extended Bose-Hubbard model using the concept of resonance-induced amplification (RIA). This method enables the selection of an incident pulse frequency to amplify the desired harmonic order. We characterize the enhancement of the non-linear harmonic spectra under various frequencies and field strengths of the incident pulses, and demonstrate that an optimal field strength is necessary to realize our protocol.</description>

      <title>Signatures of hidden octupolar order from nonlinear Hall effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting symmetry-breaking hidden orders with conventional probes has been a long-standing challenge in the field of magnetism. Higher-rank multipolar ordering $-$ anisotropic charge and magnetization distributions arising from a combination of spin-orbit coupling and crystalline environments $-$ is a quintessential example of such hidden orders, where new protocols of direct detection remain highly desirable. In this work, we propose non-linear Hall effects as a novel probe for multipolar ordering in metallic systems. Taking inspiration from the family of Pr-based heavy-fermion compounds, Pr(Ti,V)$_2$Al$_{20}$, we formulate a minimal cubic-lattice model of conduction electrons coupled to a ferro-octupolar order parameter. The time-reversal-breaking order leads to a band structure that supports strong quadrupolar moments of the Berry curvature (BC). Using a semi-classical Boltzmann formalism in conjunction with a symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that the BC quadrupoles produce a third harmonic generation of the Hall voltage $[V_H(3 \omega)]$ measurable in an AC Hall experiment. Properties of the Hall response such as its anisotropy, its dissipationlessness, and its dependence on the order parameter are also examined. Our work encourages a new realm of investigation of multipolar ordering from non-linear transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Signature of anyonic statistics in the integer quantum Hall regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyons are exotic low-dimensional quasiparticles whose unconventional quantum statistics extends the binary particle division into fermions and bosons. The fractional quantum Hall regime provides a natural host, with first convincing anyon signatures recently observed through interferometry and cross-correlations of colliding beams. However, the fractional regime is rife with experimental complications, such as an anomalous tunneling density of states, which impede the manipulation of anyons. Here we show experimentally that the canonical integer quantum Hall regime can provide a robust anyon platform. Exploiting the Coulomb interaction between two co-propagating quantum Hall channels, an electron injected into one channel splits into two fractional charges behaving as abelian anyons. Their unconventional statistics is revealed by negative cross-correlations between dilute quasiparticle beams. Similarly to fractional quantum Hall observations, we show that the negative signal stems from a time-domain braiding process, here involving the incident fractional quasiparticles and spontaneously generated electron-hole pairs. Beyond the dilute limit, a theoretical understanding is achieved via the edge magnetoplasmon description of interacting integer quantum Hall channels. Our findings establish that, counter-intuitively, the integer quantum Hall regime provides a platform of choice for exploring and manipulating quasiparticles with fractional quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Electric field tunable superconductivity with competing orders in twisted bilayer graphene near magic-angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) has been explored by varying carrier concentrations, twist angles, and screening strength, with the aim of uncovering its origin and possible connections to strong electronic correlations in narrow bands and various resulting broken symmetries. However, the link between the tBLG band structure and the onset of SC and other orders largely remains unclear. In this study, we address this crucial gap by examining in-situ band structure tuning of a near magic-angle ($\theta \approx0.95^\circ$) tBLG device with displacement field ($D$) and reveal remarkable competition between SC and other broken symmetries. At zero $D$, the device exhibits superconducting signatures without the resistance peak at half-filling, a characteristic signature with a strong electronic correlation. As $D$ increases, the SC is suppressed, accompanied by the appearance of a resistance peak at half-filling. Hall density measurements reveal that at zero $D$, SC arises around the van Hove singularity (vHs) from an isospin or spin-valley unpolarized band. At higher $D$, the suppression of SC coincides with broken isospin symmetry near half-filling with lifted degeneracy ($g_d \sim 2$). Additionally, as the SC phase becomes weaker with $D$, vHs shifts to higher fillings, highlighting the modification of the underlying band structure with the applied electric field. These findings, with recent theoretical study on SC in tBLG, highlight the competition, rather being connected concomitantly, between SC and other orders promoted by broken symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin dynamics in two electron double quantum dots embedded in two dimensional electron gas at the interface between SrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$ is studied by an exact numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, in the context of the electric dipole spin resonance experiment. Based on the three band model of $3d$-electrons localized at Ti ions on the square lattice we analyze in details the singlet-triplet transition induced by the AC electric field, in the magnetic field range close to the avoided crossing which appears as a result of the spin-orbit coupling. Our calculations show that for symmetric double quantum dots the single photon spin-flip transitions is prohibited due to the parity symmetry and the transition can occur only by the higher order two-photon processes. For a weakly asymmetric system, when the first order singlet-triplet transitions are released due to the parity symmetry breaking, the spin-flip transition has a character of the Rabi oscillations for a low electric field amplitude. As the amplitude is increased the frequency of the transition is blueshifted (redshifted) for the magnetic field below (above) the single-triplet avoided crossing. Interestingly, for a sufficiently high magnetic field and high AC field amplitude the electric field drives the system across the avoided crossing inducing the spin-flip by the Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg-Majorana transitions with 100\% spin flip probability for a slow sweep. Finally, the optimization of the geometrical parameters of the system with respect to the time of spin-flip of its fidelity is also presented.</description>

      <title>Strain effects on the electronic properties of a graphene wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the strain and curvature effects on the electronic properties of a curved graphene structure, called the graphene wormhole. The electron dynamics is described by a massless Dirac fermion containing position--dependent Fermi velocity. In addition, the strain produces a pseudo--magnetic vector potential to the geometric coupling. For an isotropic strain tensor, the decoupled components of the spinor field exhibit a supersymmetric (SUSY) potential, depending on the centrifugal term and the external magnetic field only. In the absence of a external magnetic field, the strain yields to an exponential damped amplitude, whereas the curvature leads to a power--law damping of the wave function. The spin--curvature coupling breaks the chiral symmetry between the upper and the lower spinor component, which leads to the increasing of the wave function on either upper or lower region of the wormhole, i.e., depending on the spin number. By adding an uniform magnetic field, the effective potential exhibits an asymptotic quadratic profile and a spin--curvature barrier near the throat. As a result, the bound states (Landau levels) are confined around the wormhole throat showing an asymmetric and spin--dependent profile.</description>

Abstract: A fully analytical approach based on the equation of motion technique to investigate the spectral properties and orbital occupations in an interacting double quantum dot in equilibrium is presented. By solving a linear system for the density correlators analytically, an explicit expression for the one body Green's function in terms of local occupations, intra- and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, and the model parameters is derived. In the uncontacted limit, the results coincide with those obtained from the grand canonical ensemble. The analytical results compare favourably with numerical results obtained with the non-crossing approximation and the hierarchical equation of motion methods accurately reproducing peak positions and spectral weight distributions in the Coulomb blockade regime.</description>

      <title>Absence of Majorana oscillations in finite-length full-shell hybrid nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana bound states (MBSs) located at the ends of a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire are only true zero modes if their characteristic localization length is much smaller than the nanowire length, $\xi_M\ll L$. Otherwise, their wave function overlap gives rise to a finite energy splitting that shows a characteristic oscillatory pattern $\sim e^{-2L/\xi_M}\cos(k_F L)$ versus external parameters that modify the Fermi momentum $k_F$. Detecting such "Majorana oscillations", measurable through low-bias conductance, has been proposed as a strategy for Majorana detection in pristine nanowires. Here we discuss how this detection scheme does not work in full-shell hybrid nanowires, an alternative design to partial-shell nanowires in which a superconductor shell fully wraps the semiconductor core. Using microscopic models, we provide both numerical simulations for Al/InAs hybrids as well as analytical approximations in terms of general nanowire parameters. We find that Majorana oscillations with flux in full-shell nanowires are absent in a wide portion of parameter space. This absence is not a signature of non-overlapping left- and right-end MBSs, but a consequence of the Majorana oscillation period being systematically larger than the flux window of odd Little-Parks lobes where Majorana zero-energy peaks are predicted to appear. Our results demonstrate that split near-zero modes or individual zero-energy crossings should not be dismissed as trivial even if they are found not to oscillate with flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or on symmetry-forbidden transitions. Here, we observe quantized currents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing of the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness using a local picture in \textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener transitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates. Moreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Group-IV Pentaoctite: A New 2D Material Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of novel two-dimensional (2D) pentaoctite (PO) monolayers composed of group-IV elements (PO-C, PO-Si, PO-Ge, and PO-Sn) using first-principles calculations. Stability is explored through phonon spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, confirming that all proposed structures are dynamically and thermally stable. Mechanical analysis shows that PO-C monolayers exhibit exceptional rigidity, while the others demonstrate greater flexibility, making them suitable for applications in foldable materials. The electronic properties show semimetallic behavior for PO-C and metallic behavior for PO-Si, while PO-Ge and PO-Sn possess narrow band gaps, positioning them as promising candidates for semiconductor applications. Additionally, PO-C exhibits potential as an efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with strain engineering further enhancing its catalytic performance. These findings suggest a wide range of technological applications, from nanoelectronics and nanomechanics to metal-free catalysis in sustainable energy production.</description>

      <title>Inner non-Hermitian skin effect on Bethe lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on Bethe lattice, revealing a novel localization phenomenon coined inner non-Hermitian skin effect. This effect is featured by the localization of all eigenstates within the bulk of the lattice, diverging from the conventional skin effect observed in general non-Hermitian systems. The analytical treatment of the model demonstrates that the Hamiltonian can be decoupled into a series of one-dimensional chains, with one end fixed at the bottom boundary while the other ends positioned at varying generations within the bulk. This configuration leads to the emergence of the inner non-Hermitian skin effect, which is further validated by performing circuit simulations. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between non-Hermitian physics and the self-similar structure on Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>Nernst Plateau in the Quantum Limit of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nernst effect, a transverse electric current induced by a temperature gradient, is a promising tool for revealing emergent phases of condensed matter. We find a Nernst coefficient plateau in low carrier density topological insulators, as a signature of 1D Weyl points in the quantum limit of the weak topological insulator. The plateau height is inversely proportional to the impurity density, suggesting a way to engineer infinitely large Nernst effects. The Nernst plateau also exists in strong topological insulators, at the bottom of the lowest Landau band. We show that these plateaus have been overlooked in the previous experiments and we highlight the experimental conditions to observe them. Our results may inspire more investigations of employing anomalous Nernst effect to identify emergent phases of condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamics of scale-free interactions in fractional quantum Hall fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that even in the limit of large cyclotron gap, Landau level (LL) mixing can be dominant with scale-free interaction between charged ``elementary particles" in a fractional quantum Hall system, as long as the filling factor exceeds certain critical values. The corresponding Hamiltonians with scale-free interaction can serve as exact model Hamiltonians for certain composite Fermion or parton states (unlike the well-known TK Hamiltonians where the number of LLs needs to be fixed by hand), and they are natural physical Hamiltonians for 2D systems embedded in higher-dimensional space-time. Even with LL mixing the null spaces of such Hamiltonians (spanned by the ground state and the quasiholes) can be analytically obtained, and we show these are the generalisation of the conformal Hilbert spaces (CHS) to more than one LLs. The effective interaction between the anyons for these topological phases emerges from the kinetic energy of the ``elementary particles", leading to an interesting duality between strongly and weakly interacting systems that can be easily understood via the tuning of parameters in the scale-free interaction. We also propose a novel experimental platform for approximately realising such model Hamiltonians with trion like particles, that can potentially lead to very robust (non-Abelian) FQH phases from two-body Coulomb-based interaction.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Parametric Amplification in Raman-Cavity Hybrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametric resonances and amplification have led to extraordinary photoinduced phenomena in pump-probe experiments. While these phenomena manifest themselves in out-of-equilibrium settings, here, we present the striking result of parametric amplification in equilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that quantum and thermal fluctuations of a Raman-active mode amplifies light inside a cavity, at equilibrium, when the Raman mode frequency is twice the cavity mode frequency. This noise-driven amplification leads to the creation of an unusual parametric Raman polariton, intertwining the Raman mode with cavity squeezing fluctuations, with smoking gun signatures in Raman spectroscopy. In the resonant regime, we show the emergence of not only quantum light amplification but also localization and static shift of the Raman mode. Apart from the fundamental interest of equilibrium parametric amplification our study suggests a resonant mechanism for controlling Raman modes and thus matter properties by cavity fluctuations. We conclude by outlining how to compute the Raman-cavity coupling, and suggest possible experimental realization</description>

      <title>From Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Smectics to Polar Smectic Metals: Nontrivial Interplay Between Electronic Liquid Crystal Order and Topological Order in Correlated Topological Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking orders can not only compete with each other, but also be interwined, and the interwined topological and symmetry-breaking orders make the situation more intriguing. This work examines the archetypal correlated flat band model on a checkerboard lattice at filling $\nu=2/3$ and we find the unique interplay between smectic charge order and topological order gives rise to two novel quantum states. As the interaction strength increases, the system first transitions from a Fermi liquid into FQAH smectic (FQAHS) state, where FQAH topological order coexists cooperatively with smectic charge order with enlarged ground-state degeneracy and interestingly, the Hall conductivity is $\sigma_{xy}=\nu=2/3$, different from the band-folding or doping scenarios. Further increasing the interaction strength, the system undergoes another quantum phase transition and evolves into a polar smectic metal (PSM) state. This emergent PSM is an anisotropic non-Fermi liquid, whose interstripe tunneling is irrelevant while it is metallic inside each stripe. Different from the FQAHS and conventional smectic orders, this PSM spontaneously breaks the two-fold rotational symmetry, resulting in a nonzero electric dipole moment and ferroelectric order. In addition to the exotic ground states, large-scale numerical simulations are also used to study low-energy excitations and thermodynamic characteristics. We find the onset temperature of the incompressible FQAHS state, which also coincides with the onset of non-polar smectic order, is dictated by the magneto-roton modes. Above this onset temperature, the PSM state exists at intermediate-temperature regime. Although the T = 0 quantum phase transition between PSM and FQAHS is first order, the thermal FQAHS-PSM transition could be continuous. We expect the features of the exotic states and thermal phase transitions could be accessed in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems (NFTs) relate work performed on a system as its Hamiltonian varies with time, to equilibrium data of the initial and final states. In a classical context the system energy can be directly measured, while a quantum implementation requires the incorporation of a work-agent. We demonstrate that the uncertainty principle imposes inherent quantum limitations on the applicability of the NFT for probing non-trivial mesoscopic systems. We work out the NFT validity regime for the simplest quantum-dot toy model, and discuss future applications.</description>

      <title>Synchronization-induced violation of thermodynamic uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations affect the functionality of nanodevices. Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs), derived within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, show that a minimal amount of dissipation is required to obtain a given relative energy current dispersion, that is, current precision has a thermodynamic cost. It is therefore of great interest to explore the possibility that TURs are violated, particularly for quantum systems, leading to accurate currents at lower cost. Here, we show that two quantum harmonic oscillators are synchronized by coupling to a common thermal environment, at strong dissipation and low temperature. In this regime, periodically modulated couplings to a second thermal reservoir, breaking time-reversal symmetry and taking advantage of non-Markovianity of this latter reservoir, lead to strong violation of TURs for local work currents, while maintaining finite output power. Our results pave the way for the use of synchronization in the thermodynamics of precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum metric of single-particle wave functions in topological flatbands plays a crucial role in determining the stability of fractional Chern insulating (FCI) states. Here, we unravel that the quantum metric causes the many-body Chern number of the FCI states to deviate sharply from the expected value associated with partial filling of the single-particle topological flatband. Furthermore, the variation of the quantum metric in momentum space induces band dispersion through interactions, affecting the stability of the FCI states. This causes a reentrant transition into the Fermi liquid from the FCI phase as the interaction strength increases.</description>

      <title>Classifying topological floppy modes in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In floppy mechanical lattices, robust edge states and bulk Weyl modes are manifestations of underlying topological invariants. To explore the universality of these phenomena independent of microscopic detail, we formulate topological mechanics in the continuum. By augmenting standard linear elasticity with additional fields of soft modes, we define a continuum version of Maxwell counting, which balances degrees of freedom and mechanical constraints. With one additional field, these augmented elasticity theories can break spatial inversion symmetry and harbor topological edge states. We also show that two additional fields are necessary to harbor Weyl points in two dimensions, and define continuum invariants to classify these states. In addition to constructing the general form of topological elasticity based on symmetries, we derive the coefficients based on the systematic homogenization of microscopic lattices. By solving the resulting partial differential equations, we efficiently predict coarse-grained deformations due to topological floppy modes without the need for a detailed lattice-based simulation. Our discovery formulates novel design principles and efficient computational tools for topological states of matter, and points to their experimental implementation in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Type-I and Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric (TE) properties of nodal line semimetals (NLSs) using a combination of semi-analytical calculations within Boltzmann's linear transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, along with first-principles calculations for the so-called type-I and type-II NLSs. We consider the conduction and valence bands that cross near the Fermi level of these materials through first-principles calculations of typical type-I (TiS) and type-II (Mg$_3$Bi$_2$) NLSs and use the two-band model fit to find the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and effective mass $m$ that will be employed as the initial energy dispersion parameters. The optimum curvature value for each energy band is searched by tuning the energy dispersion parameters to improve the TE properties of the NLss. We can obtain the best $\sim$$3.5\%$ increase in the Seebeck coefficient peak value compared to those using the initial parameter value in the type-I NLS, with the Seebeck coefficient ranging from $0.509S_{0}$ to $0.527S_{0}$ where $S_0 \approx 86.17~\mu$V/K. Meanwhile, the best increase in power factor, as large as $\sim$$83\%$ the initial value, can be obtained in the type-II NLS when $v_{F}$ is lowered. By systematically comparing all of our calculation results, we observed that tuning $v_{F}$ significantly improves TE properties in both types of NLS compared to tuning $m$. Our work is expected to trigger further calculations to scan other potential TE materials, particularly in the class of semimetals, by manipulating their band structure through the variation of the curvatures of their energy bands.</description>
