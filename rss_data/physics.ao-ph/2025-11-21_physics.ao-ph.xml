      <title>Cloud droplet size distribution and optical properties only weakly linked to aerosol size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changes in aerosol concentrations can modify cloud brightness, producing a strong but poorly constrained influence on Earth's energy balance. Because cloud reflectivity depends on the size distribution of cloud droplets, and aerosol size strongly governs activation into droplets, one might expect cloud properties to be sensitive to aerosol size distributions. Here we show, through a combination of cloud chamber experiments and high-resolution simulations, that cloud microphysical and optical properties are often insensitive to aerosol size. Detectable impacts on cloud optical properties occur only under weak convective forcing and high aerosol concentrations. These results indicate that, in most conditions, cloud reflectivity can be predicted from aerosol number alone without detailed knowledge of aerosol size distributions, providing new constraints on how aerosol perturbations affect climate.</description>

      <title>Nowcasting of Aviation Radiation Using Geospace Environment Properties: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation exposure at aviation altitudes presents significant health risks to aircrews due to the cumulative effects of ionizing radiation. Physics-based models estimate radiation levels based on geophysical and atmospheric parameters, but often struggle to capture the highly dynamic and complex nature of the radiation environment, limiting their real-time predictive capabilities. To address this challenge, we investigate machine learning (ML) methods to enhance real-time radiation nowcasting. Leveraging newly compiled ML-ready datasets, publicly available at https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/rdp/, we train supervised models capable of capturing both linear and non-linear relationships between Geospace conditions and atmospheric radiation levels. Our experiments demonstrate that the XGBoost model achieves approximately 10 percent improvement in prediction accuracy over the considered physics-based model. Furthermore, feature importance analysis reveals that certain Geospace properties, specifically solar polar fields, solar wind properties, and neutron monitor data, are impacting the nowcast of the radiation levels at flight altitudes. These findings suggest meaningful physical relationships between the near-Earth space environment and atmospheric radiation, and highlight the potential of ML-based approaches for operational space weather applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled atmospHere Interior modeL Intercomparison (CHILI) Protocol Version 1.0: A CUISINES Intercomparison Project of Magma Ocean Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic characterization of rocky exoplanets with the James Webb Space Telescope has brought the origin and evolution of their atmospheres into the focus of exoplanet science. Time-evolved models of the feedback between interior and atmosphere are critical to predict and interpret these observations and link them to the Solar System terrestrial planets. However, models differ in methodologies and input data, which can lead to significant differences in interpretation. In this paper, we present the experimental protocol of the Coupled atmospHere Interior modeL Intercomparison (CHILI) project. CHILI is an (exo-)planet model intercomparison project within the Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies (CUISINES) framework, which aims to support a diverse set of multi-model intercomparison projects in the exoplanet community. The present protocol includes the initial set of participating magma ocean models, divided into evolutionary and static models, and two types of test categories, one focused on Solar System planets (Earth &amp; Venus) and the other on exoplanets orbiting low-mass M-dwarfs. Both test categories aim to quantify the evolution of key markers of the links between planetary atmospheres and interiors over geological timescales. The proposed tests would allow us to quantify and compare the differences between coupled atmosphere-interior models used by the exoplanet and planetary science communities. Results from the proposed tests will be published in dedicated follow-up papers. To encourage the community to join this comparison effort and as an example, we present initial test results for the early Earth and TRAPPIST-1 b, conducted with models differing in the treatment of energy transport in the planetary interior and atmosphere, surface boundary layer, geochemistry, and the in- and outgassing of volatile compounds.</description>

      <title>Local wind speed forecasting at short time horizons based on Numerical Weather Prediction and observations from surrounding stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid neural network model for short-term (1-6 hours ahead) surface wind speed forecasting, combining Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) with observational data from ground weather stations. It relies on the MeteoNet dataset, which includes data from global (ARPEGE) and regional (AROME) NWP models of the French weather service and meteorological observations from ground stations in the French Mediterranean. The proposed neural network architecture integrates recent past station observations (over last few hours) and AROME and ARPEGE predictions on a small subgrid around the target location. The model is designed to provide both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts, with the latter predicting the parameters of a suitable probability distribution that notably allows us to capture extreme wind events. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid model significantly outperforms baseline methods, including raw NWP predictions, persistence models, and linear regression, across all forecast horizons. For instance, the model reduces RMSE by up 30\% compared to AROME predictions. Probabilistic forecasting further enhances performance, particularly for extreme quantiles, by estimating conditional quantiles rather than relying solely on the conditional mean. Fine-tuning the model for specific stations, such as those in the Mediterranean island of Corsica, further improves forecasting accuracy. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multiple data sources and probabilistic approaches to improve short-term wind speed forecasting. It defines an effective approach, even in a complex terrain like Corsica where localized wind variations are significant</description>

      <title>How Convective Mass Flux Responds to Environmental Humidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our goal in this study is to characterize the relationship between lower tropospheric environmental humidity and convective mass flux in the tropics. To do so, we have created gridded convective mass flux datasets from five global storm-resolving models (GSRMs). We have three principal findings. First, in humid environments, mass flux increases with height from the surface through the depth of the lower free troposphere, forming a ``deep-inflow". In dry environments, mass flux does not increase with height in the lower free troposphere. Second, mid-tropospheric mass flux increases nonlinearly with increasing lower tropospheric humidity, resembling a widely reported pickup in tropical precipitation. Third, increased lower tropospheric humidity is associated with reduced deep convective updraft buoyancy. To interpret these findings, we employ a simple three-equation parcel model with stochastic entrainment. The parcel model suggests that the response of convective mass flux to lower tropospheric humidity is governed by two effects: (1) survival, in which a greater share of entraining parcels ascend rather than detrain with greater humidity; and (2) dilution, in which the average entrainment rate among surviving parcels increases with environmental humidity. Together, survival and dilution account for the three mass flux responses to humidity.</description>
