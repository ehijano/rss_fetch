      <title>Optimal Design of Climate Disclosure Policies: Transparency versus Externality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does a more transparent climate disclosure policy induce lower emissions? This paper examines the welfare implications of transparency in climate disclosure regulation. Increased disclosure transparency could result in a larger equilibrium externality, but never leaves the firm worse off. Consequently, mandating full disclosure is no different from maximizing the firm's private benefit while disregarding the ensuing externality. Transparency beyond binary disclosure is necessary only when the firm holds private information about its incentives for emission reduction. I provide conditions under which focusing on threshold disclosure policies entails no loss of generality.</description>

      <title>Certifying Lemons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines an adverse selection environment where a sender with private information (high or low ability) tries to convince a receiver of having higher ability. Without commitment or costly signaling, market failure can occur. Certification intermediaries reduce these frictions by enabling signaling through hard information. This paper focuses on a monopolistic certifier and its impact on equilibrium welfare and certificate design. Key findings show that the certifier provides minimal information, pooling senders of varying abilities and leaving low rents for high type senders, which typically disadvantages the receiver. However, when precise information is demanded, the certifier screens the sender perfectly, benefiting the receiver. Thus, the monopolistic intermediary has an ambiguous effect on market efficiency. The results emphasize the importance of high certification standards, which drive low ability senders out of the market. Conditions for such equilibria are characterized, showing how simple threshold strategies by the receiver induce first-best outcomes. Additionally, the relationship between the characteristics of offered certificates and welfare is identified.</description>

      <title>Harmful choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the choice behavior of a decision maker (DM) who harms herself, by maximizing some distortion of her true preference, in which the first $i$ alternatives are moved to the bottom, in a reversed order. The deterministic declination of our pattern has no empirical power, but it allows to define a degree of self-punishment, which measures the extent of the denial of pleasure adopted by the DM in her decision. We analyze irrational choices that display the lowest degree of self-punishment, and a characterization of them is provided. Moreover, we characterize the choice behavior that exhibits the highest degree of self-punishment, and we show that it comprises almost all choices. We also characterize stochastic self-punishment, which collects all the Random Utility Models (RUMs) whose support is restricted to the harmful distortions of some preference. Full identification of the DM's preference and randomization over its harmful distortions is allowed if each alternative is selected from the ground set with probability greater than zero. Finally, the degree of self-punishment of harmful stochastic choices is characterized.</description>
