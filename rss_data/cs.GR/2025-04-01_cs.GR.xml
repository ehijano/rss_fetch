      <title>CBIL: Collective Behavior Imitation Learning for Fish from Real Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducing realistic collective behaviors presents a captivating yet formidable challenge. Traditional rule-based methods rely on hand-crafted principles, limiting motion diversity and realism in generated collective behaviors. Recent imitation learning methods learn from data but often require ground truth motion trajectories and struggle with authenticity, especially in high-density groups with erratic movements. In this paper, we present a scalable approach, Collective Behavior Imitation Learning (CBIL), for learning fish schooling behavior directly from videos, without relying on captured motion trajectories. Our method first leverages Video Representation Learning, where a Masked Video AutoEncoder (MVAE) extracts implicit states from video inputs in a self-supervised manner. The MVAE effectively maps 2D observations to implicit states that are compact and expressive for following the imitation learning stage. Then, we propose a novel adversarial imitation learning method to effectively capture complex movements of the schools of fish, allowing for efficient imitation of the distribution for motion patterns measured in the latent space. It also incorporates bio-inspired rewards alongside priors to regularize and stabilize training. Once trained, CBIL can be used for various animation tasks with the learned collective motion priors. We further show its effectiveness across different species. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our system in detecting abnormal fish behavior from in-the-wild videos.</description>

      <title>The Granule-In-Cell Method for Simulating Sand--Water Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of sand--water mixtures requires capturing the stochastic behavior of individual sand particles within a uniform, continuous fluid medium, such as the characteristic of migration, deposition, and plugging across various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Granule-in-Cell (GIC) method for simulating such sand--water interaction. We leverage the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to capture the fine-scale details of individual granules and the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method for its continuous spatial representation and particle-based structure for density projection. To combine these two frameworks, we treat granules as macroscopic transport flow rather than solid boundaries for the fluid. This bidirectional coupling allows our model to accommodate a range of interphase forces with different discretization schemes, resulting in a more realistic simulation with fully respect to the mass conservation equation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulating complex sand--water interactions, while maintaining volume consistency. Notably, in the dam-breaking experiment, our simulation uniquely captures the distinct physical properties of sand under varying infiltration degree within a single scenario. Our work advances the state of the art in granule--fluid simulation, offering a unified framework that bridges mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Feature-Preserving Mesh Decimation for Normal Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal integration reconstructs 3D surfaces from normal maps obtained e.g. by photometric stereo. These normal maps capture surface details down to the pixel level but require large computational resources for integration at high resolutions. In this work, we replace the dense pixel grid with a sparse anisotropic triangle mesh prior to normal integration. We adapt the triangle mesh to the local geometry in the case of complex surface structures and remove oversampling from flat featureless regions. For high-resolution images, the resulting compression reduces normal integration runtimes from hours to minutes while maintaining high surface accuracy. Our main contribution is the derivation of the well-known quadric error measure from mesh decimation for screen space applications and its combination with optimal Delaunay triangulation.</description>

      <title>Explorable INR: An Implicit Neural Representation for Ensemble Simulation Enabling Efficient Spatial and Parameter Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing computational power available for high-resolution ensemble simulations in scientific fields such as cosmology and oceanology, storage and computational demands present significant challenges. Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis.</description>

      <title>WorldScore: A Unified Evaluation Benchmark for World Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the WorldScore benchmark, the first unified benchmark for world generation. We decompose world generation into a sequence of next-scene generation tasks with explicit camera trajectory-based layout specifications, enabling unified evaluation of diverse approaches from 3D and 4D scene generation to video generation models. The WorldScore benchmark encompasses a curated dataset of 3,000 test examples that span diverse worlds: static and dynamic, indoor and outdoor, photorealistic and stylized. The WorldScore metrics evaluate generated worlds through three key aspects: controllability, quality, and dynamics. Through extensive evaluation of 19 representative models, including both open-source and closed-source ones, we reveal key insights and challenges for each category of models. Our dataset, evaluation code, and leaderboard can be found at https://haoyi-duan.github.io/WorldScore/</description>

      <title>GeometryCrafter: Consistent Geometry Estimation for Open-world Videos with Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in video depth estimation, existing methods exhibit inherent limitations in achieving geometric fidelity through the affine-invariant predictions, limiting their applicability in reconstruction and other metrically grounded downstream tasks. We propose GeometryCrafter, a novel framework that recovers high-fidelity point map sequences with temporal coherence from open-world videos, enabling accurate 3D/4D reconstruction, camera parameter estimation, and other depth-based applications. At the core of our approach lies a point map Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that learns a latent space agnostic to video latent distributions for effective point map encoding and decoding. Leveraging the VAE, we train a video diffusion model to model the distribution of point map sequences conditioned on the input videos. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that GeometryCrafter achieves state-of-the-art 3D accuracy, temporal consistency, and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>LayerCraft: Enhancing Text-to-Image Generation with CoT Reasoning and Layered Object Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation (T2I) has become a key area of research with broad applications. However, existing methods often struggle with complex spatial relationships and fine-grained control over multiple concepts. Many existing approaches require significant architectural modifications, extensive training, or expert-level prompt engineering. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{LayerCraft}, an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents for structured procedural generation. LayerCraft enables users to customize objects within an image and supports narrative-driven creation with minimal effort. At its core, the system includes a coordinator agent that directs the process, along with two specialized agents: \textbf{ChainArchitect}, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate a dependency-aware 3D layout for precise instance-level control, and the \textbf{Object-Integration Network (OIN)}, which utilizes LoRA fine-tuning on pre-trained T2I models to seamlessly blend objects into specified regions of an image based on textual prompts without requiring architectural changes. Extensive evaluations demonstrate LayerCraft's versatility in applications ranging from multi-concept customization to storytelling. By providing non-experts with intuitive, precise control over T2I generation, our framework democratizes creative image creation.

      <title>RainyGS: Efficient Rain Synthesis with Physically-Based Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of adding dynamic rain effects to in-the-wild scenes in a physically-correct manner. Recent advances in scene modeling have made significant progress, with NeRF and 3DGS techniques emerging as powerful tools for reconstructing complex scenes. However, while effective for novel view synthesis, these methods typically struggle with challenging scene editing tasks, such as physics-based rain simulation. In contrast, traditional physics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as raindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set up high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability, limiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work, we introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both physics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain effects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method is the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation techniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and efficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our method supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users flexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours. We demonstrate that RainyGS performs effectively for both real-world outdoor scenes and large-scale driving scenarios, delivering more photorealistic and physically-accurate rain effects compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Enhanced Controllability of Diffusion Models via Feature Disentanglement and Realism-Enhanced Sampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.</description>

      <title>DetailGen3D: Generative 3D Geometry Enhancement via Data-Dependent Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models. We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches, from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while maintaining efficiency in training.</description>

      <title>Feed-Forward Bullet-Time Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes from Monocular Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in static feed-forward scene reconstruction have demonstrated significant progress in high-quality novel view synthesis. However, these models often struggle with generalizability across diverse environments and fail to effectively handle dynamic content. We present BTimer (short for BulletTimer), the first motion-aware feed-forward model for real-time reconstruction and novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes. Our approach reconstructs the full scene in a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation at a given target ('bullet') timestamp by aggregating information from all the context frames. Such a formulation allows BTimer to gain scalability and generalization by leveraging both static and dynamic scene datasets. Given a casual monocular dynamic video, BTimer reconstructs a bullet-time scene within 150ms while reaching state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic scene datasets, even compared with optimization-based approaches.</description>
