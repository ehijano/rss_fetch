      <title>A finite algebraic presentation of Lawvere theories in the object-classifier topos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the topos of sets, the notion of Lawvere theory is infinite countably-sorted algebraic but not one-sorted algebraic. Shifting viewpoint over the object-classifier topos, a finite algebraic presentation of Lawvere theories is considered.</description>

      <title>A Relational Category of Birkhoff Polarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Garret Birkhoff observed that any binary relation between two sets determines a Galois connection between the powersets, or equivalently, closure operators on the powersets, or equivalently, complete lattices of subsets that are dually isomorphic. Referring to the duality of, say, points and lines in projective geometry, he named the binary relations as polarities.
  Researchers since then have used polarities (also known as formal contexts) as a convenient technical way to build complete lattices from ``found'' data. And so, various proposals for suitable morphisms between polarities have tended to have a particular application in mind.
  In this work, we develop the structure of a category of polarities and compatible relations, adopting Birkhoff's original simple idea that the structure of a polarity is its the Galois connection. Hence, morphisms must be relations that, in a reasonable sense, preserve Galois connections. In particular, the dual equivalence of the category to the category of complete meet semilattices, completeness of the category, characterization of epimorphisms and monomorphisms, an epi/mono factorization system, as well as the star-autonomous structure of the category, all arise by extending Birkhoff's original observation to morphisms.</description>

      <title>Nerves of enriched categories via necklaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce necklicial nerve functors from enriched categories to simplicial sets, which include Cordier's homotopy coherent, Lurie's differential graded and Le Grignou's cubical nerves. It is shown that every necklicial nerve can be lifted to the templicial objects of arXiv:2302.02484v2. Building on the work of Dugger and Spivak, we give sufficient conditions under which the left-adjoint of a necklicial nerve can be described more explicitly. As an application, we obtain novel and simple expressions for the left-adjoints of the dg-nerve and cubical nerve.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Categorical Proof Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These expanded lecture notes are based on a tutorial on categorical proof theory presented at the summer school associated with the conference "Topology, Algebra, and Categories in Logic 2021-2022." The chapter delves into various applications of categorical methods in proof theory. It is designed to be accessible, with no prior familiarity with category theory required. The necessary categorical background is introduced gradually, with a focus on the philosophical and informal aspects of proof. The only prerequisites are a basic understanding of logic, computability theory, topology, and ordered structures.</description>

      <title>On the Dualizability of Fusion 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over an arbitrary field, we prove that the relative 2-Deligne tensor product of two separable module 2-categories over a compact semisimple tensor 2-category exists. This allows us to consider the Morita 4-category of compact semisimple tensor 2-categories, separable bimodule 2-categories, and their morphisms. Categorifying a result of arXiv:1312.7188, we prove that separable compact semisimple tensor 2-categories are fully dualizable objects therein. In particular, it then follows from the main theorem of arXiv:2211.04917 that, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, every fusion 2-category is a fully dualizable object of the above Morita 4-category. We explain how this can be extended to any field of characteristic zero. Finally, we discuss the field theoretic interpretation of our results.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Functors: A Mathematical Theory of Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This monograph is a study of the category of polynomial endofunctors on the category of sets and its applications to modeling interaction protocols and dynamical systems. We assume basic categorical background and build the categorical theory from the ground up, highlighting pictorical techniques and concrete examples to build intuition and provide applications.</description>
