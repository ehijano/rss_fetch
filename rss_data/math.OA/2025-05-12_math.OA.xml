      <title>The Riemann sphere of a C*-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the unital C$^*$-algebra $A$, the unitary orbit of the projector $p_0=\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}$ in the C$^*$-algebra $M_2(A)$ of $2\times 2$ matrices with coefficients in $A$ is called in this paper, the Riemann sphere $R$ of $A$. We show that $R$ is a homogeneous reductive C$^\infty$ manifold of the unitary group $U_2(A)\subset M_2(A)$ and carries the differential geometry deduced from this structure (including an invariant Finsler metric). Special attention is paid to the properties of geodesics and the exponential map. If the algebra $A$ is represented in a Hilbert space $H$, in terms of local charts of $R$, elements of the Riemann sphere may be identified with (graphs of) closed operators on $H$ (bounded or unbounded). In the first part of the paper, we develop several geometric aspects of $R$ including a relation between the exponential map of the reductive connection and the cross-ratio of subspaces of $H\times H$. In the last section we show some applications of the geometry of $R$, to the geometry of operators on a Hilbert space. In particular, we define the notion of bounded deformation of an unbounded operator and give some relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Along Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the equivalence between exponential decay of the relative entropy along a quantum Markov semigroup and the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for general von Neumann algebras. We also extend an intertwining criterion for the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality to GNS-symmetric quantum Markov semigroups on infinite-dimensional von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate complexes of Hilbert C*-modules, which are cochain complexes with (unbounded) regular operators between Hilbert C*-modules as differential maps. In particular, we provide various equivalent characterizations of the Fredholm property for such complexes of Hilbert C*-modules, and we define the Fredholm index taking values in the K-theory group of the C*-algebra. Among other properties of this index, we prove the stability under small or relatively compact perturbations, and we obtain alternative expressions for the index under the existence of a (weak or strong) Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Global structure behind pointwise equivalences of noncommutative polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interplay between local and global equivalences on noncommutative polynomials, the elements of the free algebra. When the latter are viewed as functions in several matrix variables, a local equivalence of noncommutative polynomials refers to their values sharing a common feature point-wise on matrix tuples of all dimensions, such as rank-equivalence (values have the same ranks), isospectrality (values have the same spectrum), and pointwise similarity (values are similar). On the other hand, a global equivalence refers to a ring-theoretic relation within the free algebra, such as stable association or (elementary) intertwinedness. This paper identifies the most ubiquitous pairs of local and global equivalences. Namely, rank-equivalence coincides with stable association, isospectrality coincides with both intertwinedness and transitive closure of elementary intertwinedness, and pointwise similarity coincides with equality. Using these characterizations, further results on spectral radii and norms of values of noncommutative polynomials are derived.</description>

      <title>Generically-constrained quantum isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional unitary representation of a compact quantum group $\mathrm{G}$ and denote by $\mathrm{G}_W$ the isotropy subgroup of a linear subspace $W\le V$ regarded as a point in the Grassmannian $\mathbb{G}(V)$. We show that the space of those $W\in \mathbb{G}(V)$ for which $\mathrm{G}_W$ acts trivially on $W$ (or $V$) is open in the Zariski topology of the Weil restriction $\mathrm{Res}_{\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{G}(V)$. More generally, this holds for the space of $W$ for which (a) the $\mathrm{G}_W$-action factors through its abelianization, or (b) the summands of the $\mathrm{G}_W$-representation on $W$ (or $V$) are otherwise dimensionally constrained.
  The results generalize analogous classical generic rigidity statements useful in establishing the triviality of the classical automorphism groups of random quantum graphs in the matrix algebra $M_n$, and can be put to similar use in fully non-commutative versions of those results (quantum graphs, quantum groups).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a cochain complex for ample groupoids $\mathcal G$ using a flat resolution defining their homology with coefficients in $\mathbb Z$. We prove that the cohomology of this cochain complex with values in a $\mathcal G$-module $M$ coincides with the previously introduced continuous cocycle cohomology of $\mathcal G$. In particular, this groupoid cohomology is invariant under Morita equivalence. We derive an exact sequence for the cohomology of skew products by a $\mathbb Z$-valued cocycle. We indicate how to compute the cohomology with coefficients in a $\mathcal G$-module $M$ for $AF$-groupoids and for certain action groupoids.</description>

      <title>Takai duality and crossed product hosts in C*-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossed product algebras are fundamental in the study of C*-algebras, traditionally under the assumption of continuity of group actions. Recent work by Grundling and Neeb introduced the crossed product host, an analog of the crossed product for a singular action. In this paper, we investigate the structure of the crossed product host and its relation to the conventional crossed product. We examine the validity of Takai-type duality in this setting and establish connections via the Landstad algebra. Additionally, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of ground states, and show that for amenable groups, if the full and reduced crossed product hosts exist, then they coincide.</description>

      <title>Twisted Steinberg algebras, regular inclusions and induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a field $K$ and an ample (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $G$, we define the concept of a line bundle over $G$ inspired by the well known concept from the theory of C*-algebras. If $E$ is such a line bundle, we construct the associated twisted Steinberg algebra in terms of sections of $E$, extending the original construction introduced independently by Steinberg in 2010, and by Clark, Farthing, Sims and Tomforde in a 2014 paper (originally announced in 2011). We also generalize (strictly, in the non-Hausdorff case) the 2023 construction of (cocycle) twisted Steinberg algebras of Armstrong, Clark, Courtney, Lin, Mccormick and Ramagge. We then extend Steinberg's theory of induction of modules, not only to the twisted case, but to the much more general case of regular inclusions of algebras. Among our main results, we show that, under appropriate conditions, every irreducible module is induced by an irreducible module over a certain abstractly defined isotropy algebra. We also describe a process of disintegration of modules and use it to prove a version of the Effros-Hahn conjecture, showing that every primitive ideal coincides with the annihilator of a module induced from isotropy.</description>

      <title>Operators associated with the pentablock and their relations with biball and symmetrized bidisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A commuting triple of Hilbert space operators $(A,S,P)$ is said to be a \textit{$\mathbb{P}$-contraction} if the closed pentablock $\overline{\mathbb P}$ is a spectral set for $(A,S,P)$, where
  \[
  \mathbb{P}:=\left\{(a_{21}, \mbox{tr}(A_0), \mbox{det}(A_0))\ : \ A_0=[a_{ij}]_{2 \times 2} \; \; \&amp; \;\; \|A_0\| &lt;1 \right\} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^3.
  \]
  A commuting triple of normal operators $(A, S, P)$ acting on a Hilbert space is said to be a \textit{$\mathbb P$-unitary} if the Taylor-joint spectrum $\sigma_T(A, S, P)$ of $(A, S, P)$ is contained in the distinguished boundary $b\mathbb{P}$ of $\PC$. Also, $(A, S , P)$ is called a \textit{$\mathbb P$-isometry} if it is the restriction of a $\mathbb P$-unitary $(\hat A, \hat S, \hat P)$ to a joint invariant subspace of $\hat A, \hat S, \hat P$. We find several characterizations for the $\mathbb P$-unitaries and $\mathbb P$-isometries. We show that every $\mathbb P$-isometry admits a Wold type decomposition that splits it into a direct sum of a $\mathbb P$-unitary and a pure $\mathbb P$-isometry. Moving one step ahead we show that every $\mathbb P$-contraction $(A,S,P)$ possesses a canonical decomposition that orthogonally decomposes $(A,S,P)$ into a $\mathbb P$-unitary and a completely non-unitary $\mathbb P$-contraction. We find a necessary and sufficient condition such that a $\mathbb P$-contraction $(A, S, P)$ dilates to a $\mathbb P$-isometry $(X, T, V)$ with $V$ being the minimal isometric dilation of $P$. Then we show an explicit construction of such a conditional dilation. We show interplay between operator theory on the following three domains: the pentablock, the biball and the symmetrized bidisc.</description>

      <title>On von Neumann regularity of ample groupoid algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We completely characterize when the algebra of an ample groupoid with coefficients in an arbitrary unital ring is von Neumann regular and, more generally, when the algebra of a graded ample groupoid is graded von Neumann regular. Our main application is to resolve the question, open since 1970, of when the algebra of an inverse semigroup is von Neumann regular. As applications, we recover known results on regularity and graded regularity of Leavitt path algebras, and prove a number of new results, in particular concerning graded regularity of algebras of Deaconu-Renault groupoids and Nekrashevych-Exel-Pardo algebras of self-similar groups.</description>

      <title>Envelopes in the class of Banach algebras of polynomial growth and $C^\infty$-functions of a finite number of free variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10199v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of envelope of a topological algebra (in particular, an arbitrary associative algebra) with respect to a class of Banach algebras. In the case of the class of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth, i.e., admitting a $C^\infty$-functional calculus for every element, we get a functor that maps the algebra of polynomials in $k$ variables to the algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on $\R^k$. The envelope of a general commutative or non-commutative algebra can be treated as an algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on some commutative or non-commutative space. In particular, we describe the envelopes of the universal enveloping algebra of finite-dimensional Lie algebras, the coordinate algebras of the quantum plane and quantum $SL(2)$ and also look at some commutative examples. A result on algebras of `free $C^\infty$-functions', i.e., the envelopes of free associative algebras of finite rank $k$, is announced for general $k$ and proved for $k\le 2$.</description>

      <title>Spectral set, complete spectral set and dilation for Banach space operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Famous results due to von Neumann, Sz.-Nagy and Arveson assert that the following four statements are equivalent; a Hilbert space operator $T$ is a contraction; the closed unit disk $\overline{\mathbb D}$ is a spectral set for $T$; $T$ can be dilated to a Hilbert space isometry; $\overline{\mathbb D}$ is a complete spectral set for $T$. In this article, we show by counter examples that no two of them are equivalent for Banach space operators. If $\mathcal F_r$ is the family of all Banach space operators having norm less than or equal to $r$ and if $D_R$ denotes the open disk in the complex plane with centre at the origin and radius $R$, then we prove by an application of Bohr's theorem that $\overline{D}_R$ is the minimal spectral set for $\mathcal F_r$ if and only if $r=\frac{R}{3}$. Also, we prove the equivalence of the following two facts: the Bohr radius of $D_R$ is $\frac{R}{3}$ and $\sup \{ r&gt;0\,:\, \overline{D}_R \text{ is a spectral set for } \mathcal F_r \}=\frac{R}{3}$. We found several new characterizations for a Hilbert space in terms of spectral set and complete spectral set for different operators.</description>
