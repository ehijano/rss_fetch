      <title>Koopman Spectral Analysis and System Identification for Stochastic Dynamical Systems via Yosida Approximation of Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System identification and Koopman spectral analysis are crucial for uncovering physical laws and understanding the long-term behaviour of stochastic dynamical systems governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this work, we propose a novel method for estimating the Koopman generator of systems of SDEs, based on the theory of resolvent operators and the Yosida approximation. This enables both spectral analysis and accurate estimation and reconstruction of system parameters. The proposed approach relies on only mild assumptions about the system and effectively avoids the error amplification typically associated with direct numerical differentiation. It remains robust even under low sampling rates or with only a single observed trajectory, reliably extracting dominant spectral modes and dynamic features. We validate our method on two simple systems and compare it with existing techniques as benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and improved performance of our approach in system parameter estimation, spectral mode extraction, and overall robustness.</description>

      <title>Scalable Two-Stage Stochastic Optimal Power Flow via Separable Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Separable Projective Approximation Routine-Optimal Power Flow (SPAR-OPF) framework for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems in power systems. The framework utilizes a separable piecewise linear approximation of the value function and learns the function based on sample sub-gradient information. We present two formulations to model the learned value function, and compare their effectiveness. Additionally, an efficient statistical method is introduced to assess the quality of the obtained solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using distributed generation siting and sizing problem in three-phase unbalanced power distribution systems as an example. Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. The framework scales efficiently with system size, generating high-quality solutions in a short time when applied to a 9500-node distribution system with 1200 scenarios, while the extensive formulations and progressive hedging failed to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Probability of collision in nonlinear dynamics by moment propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the probability of collision between spacecraft is crucial for risk management and collision-avoidance strategies. Current methods often rely on Gaussian assumptions and simplifications, which can be inaccurate in highly nonlinear scenarios. This paper presents a general and efficient approach for computing collision probabilities without relying on such assumptions. Using high-order multivariate Taylor polynomials, we propagate statistical moments of initial uncertainties to the point of closest approach between the spacecraft. To compute the probability of collision, we derive a semi-analytical expression for the probability density function (PDF) of the closest approach distance, inferred from the propagated moments using orthogonal polynomials. Tested on various short-term and long-term encounters in low-Earth orbit, our method accurately handles nonlinear dynamics, non-Gaussian uncertainties, and irregular distributions. This versatile framework advances space situational awareness by providing precise collision probability estimates in complex dynamical environments. Moreover, our methodology applies to any dynamical system with uncertainty in its initial state and is therefore not restricted to collision probability estimation.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation-based Simultaneous Phase-Resolved Ocean Wave and Ship Motion Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-assimilation (DA)-based approach to forecast the phase-resolved wave evolution process and ship motion, which is developed by coupling the high-order spectral method (HOS), ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and a Cummins-equation-based ship model (CMI). With the developed EnKF-HOS-CMI method, the observation data for wave, ship, or both can be incorporated into the model, therefore producing the optimal analysis results. The developed method is validated and tested based on a synthetic problem on the motions of an irregular wave field and a box-shaped free-floating ship. We show that the EnKF-HOS-CMI method achieves much higher accuracy in the long-term simulation of nonlinear phase-resolved wave field and ship motion in comparison with the HOS-CMI method. Also, the ship parameters are estimated accurately by using a parameter-augmented state space in EnKF.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Event-Triggered Control from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-triggered Control (ETC) presents a promising paradigm for efficient resource usage in networked and embedded control systems by reducing communication instances compared to traditional time-triggered strategies. This paper introduces a novel approach to ETC for discrete-time nonlinear systems using a data-driven framework. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, the nonlinear system dynamics are globally linearized (approximately in practical settings) in a higher-dimensional space. We design a state-feedback controller and an event-triggering policy directly from data, ensuring exponential stability in Lyapunov sense. The proposed method is validated through extensive simulation experiments, demonstrating significant resource savings.</description>

      <title>Graphical Dominance Analysis for Linear Systems: A Frequency-Domain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a frequency-domain approach to dominance analysis for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant systems. The dominance of a MIMO system is defined to be the number of its poles in the open right half-plane. Our approach is graphical: we define a frequency-wise notion of the recently-introduced scaled graph of a MIMO system plotted in a complex plane. The scaled graph provides a bound of the eigenloci of the system, which can be viewed as a robust MIMO extension of the classical Nyquist plot. Our main results characterize sufficient conditions for quantifying the dominance of a closed-loop system based upon separation of scaled graphs of two open-loop systems in a frequency-wise manner. The results reconcile existing small gain, small phase and passivity theorems for feedback dominance analysis.</description>

      <title>Soft and Hard Scaled Relative Graphs for Nonlinear Feedback Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents input-output stability analysis of nonlinear feedback systems based on the notion of soft and hard scaled relative graphs (SRGs). The soft and hard SRGs acknowledge the distinction between incremental positivity and incremental passivity and reconcile them from a graphical perspective. The essence of our proposed analysis is that the separation of soft/hard SRGs of two open-loop systems on the complex plane guarantees closed-loop stability. The main results generalize an existing soft SRG separation theorem for bounded open-loop systems which was proved based on interconnection properties of soft SRGs under a chordal assumption. By comparison, our analysis does not require this chordal assumption and applies to possibly unbounded open-loop systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Security Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasingly challenging task of maintaining power grid security requires innovative solutions. Novel approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been proposed to help grid operators navigate the massive decision space and nonlinear behavior of these complex networks. However, applying RL to power grid security assessment, specifically for combinatorially troublesome contingency analysis problems, has proven difficult to scale. The integration of quantum computing into these RL frameworks helps scale by improving computational efficiency and boosting agent proficiency by leveraging quantum advantages in action exploration and model-based interdependence. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept use of quantum computing for RL agent training and simulation, we propose a hybrid agent that runs on quantum hardware using IBM's Qiskit Runtime. We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output. This agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative to a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency analysis. Additionally, we offer a comparative assessment of the training procedures for RL models integrated with a quantum backend.</description>

      <title>Online Optimal Parameter Compensation method of High-dimensional PID Controller for Robust stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical PID control is widely applied in an engineering system, with parameter regulation relying on a method like Trial - Error Tuning or the Ziegler - Nichols rule, mainly for a Single - Input Single - Output (SISO) system. However, the industrial nonlinear Multiple - Input Multiple - Output (MIMO) system demands a high - robustness PID controller due to strong state coupling, external disturbances, and faults. Existing research on PID parameter regulation for a nonlinear uncertain MIMO system has a significant drawback: it's limited to a specific system type, the control mechanism for a MIMO nonlinear system under disturbances is unclear, the MIMO PID controller over - relies on decoupled control, and lacks dynamic parameter compensation. This paper theoretically analyzes a high - dimensional PID controller for a disturbed nonlinear MIMO system, providing a condition for online dynamic parameter regulation to ensure robust stability. By transforming the parameter regulation into a two - stage minimum eigenvalue problem (EVP) solvable via the interior point method, it enables efficient online tuning. The experiment proves that the designed dynamic compensation algorithm can achieve online robust stability of system errors considering multi - channel input coupling, addressing the key limitation in the field.</description>

      <title>Proactive Radio Resource Allocation for 6G In-Factory Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G In-Factory Subnetworks (InF-S) have recently been introduced as short-range, low-power radio cells installed in robots and production modules to support the strict requirements of modern control systems. Information freshness, characterized by the Age of Information (AoI), is crucial to guarantee the stability and accuracy of the control loop in these systems. However, achieving strict AoI performance poses significant challenges considering the limited resources and the high dynamic environment of InF-S. In this work, we introduce a proactive radio resource allocation approach to minimize the AoI violation probability. The proposed approach adopts a decentralized learning framework using Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) to predict the future AoI by actively learning the system dynamics. Based on the predicted AoI value, radio resources are proactively allocated to minimize the probability of AoI exceeding a predefined threshold, hence enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the control loop. The conducted simulation results prove the effectiveness of our proposed approach to improve the AoI performance where a reduction of 98% is achieved in the AoI violation probability compared to relevant baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model order reduction for T-Product-Based dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model order reduction plays a crucial role in simplifying complex systems while preserving their essential dynamic characteristics, making it an invaluable tool in a wide range of applications, including robotic systems, signal processing, and fluid dynamics. However, traditional model order reduction techniques like balanced truncation are not designed to handle tensor data directly and instead require unfolding the data, which may lead to the loss of important higher-order structural information. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for data-driven model order reduction of T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), which are often used to capture the evolution of third-order tensor data such as images and videos through the T-product. Specifically, we develop advanced T-product-based techniques, including T-balanced truncation, T-balanced proper orthogonal decomposition, and the T-eigensystem realization algorithm for input-output TPDSs by leveraging the unique properties of T-singular value decomposition. We demonstrate that these techniques offer significant memory and computational savings while achieving reduction errors that are comparable to those of conventional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is further validated through synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Sensor Scheduling in Intrusion Detection Games with Uncertain Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of sensor scheduling for an intrusion detection task. We model this as a two-player zero-sum game over a graph, where the defender (Player 1) seeks to identify the optimal strategy for scheduling sensor orientations to minimize the probability of missed detection at minimal cost, while the intruder (Player 2) aims to identify the optimal path selection strategy to maximize missed detection probability at minimal cost. The defender's strategy space grows exponentially with the number of sensors, making direct computation of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies computationally expensive. To tackle this, we propose a distributed variant of the Weighted Majority algorithm that exploits the structure of the game's payoff matrix, enabling efficient computation of the NE strategies with provable convergence guarantees. Next, we consider a more challenging scenario where the defender lacks knowledge of the true sensor models and, consequently, the game's payoff matrix. For this setting, we develop online learning algorithms that leverage bandit feedback from sensors to estimate the NE strategies. By building on existing results from perturbation theory and online learning in matrix games, we derive high-probability order-optimal regret bounds for our algorithms. Finally, through simulations, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms in both known and unknown payoff scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Field Effect Planner for Safe Interactive Autonomous Driving on Curved Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has garnered significant attention for its potential to improve safety, traffic efficiency, and user convenience. However, the dynamic and complex nature of interactive driving poses significant challenges, including the need to navigate non-linear road geometries, handle dynamic obstacles, and meet stringent safety and comfort requirements. Traditional approaches, such as artificial potential fields (APF), often fall short in addressing these complexities independently, necessitating the development of integrated and adaptive frameworks. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous vehicle navigation that integrates artificial potential fields, Frenet coordinates, and improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). A dynamic risk field, adapted from traditional APF, is proposed to ensure interactive safety by quantifying risks and dynamically adjusting lane-changing intentions based on surrounding vehicle behavior. Frenet coordinates are utilized to simplify trajectory planning on non-straight roads, while an enhanced quintic polynomial trajectory generator ensures smooth and comfortable path transitions. Additionally, an IPSO algorithm optimizes trajectory selection in real time, balancing safety and user comfort within a feasible input range. The proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its ability to navigate complex traffic environments, maintain safety margins, and generate smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Evolutionary Game-Based Model Predictive Control for Hybrid Renewable Energy Dispatch in Autonomous Ships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven Evolutionary Game-Based Model Predictive Control (EG-MPC) framework for the energy dispatch of a hybrid renewable energy system powering an autonomous ship. The system integrates solar photovoltaic and wind turbine generation with battery energy storage and diesel backup power to ensure reliable operation. Given the uncertainties in renewable generation and dynamic energy demands, an optimal dispatch strategy is crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining system reliability. To address these challenges, we formulate a cost minimization problem that considers both battery degradation costs and diesel fuel expenses, leveraging real-world data to enhance modeling accuracy. The EG-MPC approach integrates evolutionary game dynamics within a receding-horizon optimization framework, enabling adaptive and near-optimal control solutions in real time. Simulation results based on site-specific data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves cost-effective, reliable, and adaptive energy dispatch, outperforming conventional rule-based and standard MPC approaches, particularly under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Event triggered optimal formation control for nonlinear multi-agent systems under Denial-of-Service attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal formation control problem of a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems(MASs) under Denial-of-Service(DoS) attacks. We design the optimal formation control law using an event-triggered control scheme to achieve formation objectives under DoS attacks. Critic neural network (NN)-based approach is employed to achieve the optimal control policy under DoS attacks. Event-triggered mechanism is introduced to ensure the saving of control resources. Additionally, Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to demonstrate that the local neighborhood formation error exhibits exponential stability and the estimation error of weights are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the control algorithm is validated through matlab simulations. The results indicate that under DoS attacks, the nonlinear MAS successfully achieves the desired formation for the MAS.</description>

      <title>Distributed Time-Varying Gaussian Regression via Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning time-varying functions in a distributed fashion, where agents collect local information to collaboratively achieve a shared estimate. This task is particularly relevant in control applications, whenever real-time and robust estimation of dynamic cost/reward functions in safety critical settings has to be performed. In this paper, we,adopt a finite-dimensional approximation of a Gaussian Process, corresponding to a Bayesian linear regression in an appropriate feature space, and propose a new algorithm, DistKP, to track the time-varying coefficients via a distributed Kalman filter. The proposed method works for arbitrary kernels and under weaker assumptions on the time-evolution of the function to learn compared to the literature. We validate our results using a simulation example in which a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) learns a dynamically changing wind field.</description>

      <title>Considerations on the Design of Transceivers for Ambient Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ambient IoT (A-IoT) will introduce trillions of connections and enable low-cost battery-less devices. The A-IoT nodes can achieve low cost ($\sim \$ 0.1$ like RFID tag), sub-1mW average power consumption, $\leq 10$ kbps data rates, maintenance-free working for decades, cm-scale size, cm-scale size, and supporting applications like supply chain and smart agriculture. The transceiver challenges in A-IoT focus on sub-mW receivers and crystal-less clock generation. The paper proposes an "approximate low-IF" receiver and "carrier-auxiliary IF feedback" LO synthesizer architecture for Type-B/C A-IoT devices, which tracks the RF carrier frequency and eliminates external crystals. The proposed receiver and LO generator are implemented using 55nm CMOS technology. After locking the LO calibration loop, the receiver sensitivity is better than -88 dBm. The proposed receiver architecture will promote "zero power" devices for ubiquitous IoT connectivity, bridging digital and physical worlds.</description>

      <title>PID-GM: PID Control with Gain Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) control is widely used in industrial control systems. However, up to now there are at least two open problems related with PID control. One is to have a comprehensive understanding of its robustness with respect to model uncertainties and disturbances. The other is to build intuitive, explicit and mathematically provable guidelines for PID gain tuning. In this paper, we introduce a simple nonlinear mapping to determine PID gains from three auxiliary parameters. By the mapping, PID control is shown to be equivalent to a new PD control (serving as a nominal control) plus an uncertainty and disturbance compensator (to recover the nominal performance). Then PID control can be understood, designed and tuned in a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) control framework. We discuss some basic properties of the mapping, including the existence, uniqueness and invertibility. Taking as an example the PID control applied to a general uncertain second-order plant, we prove by the singular perturbation theory that the closed-loop steady-state and transient performance depends explicitly on one auxiliary parameter which can be viewed as the virtual singular perturbation parameter (SPP) of PID control. All the three PID gains are monotonically decreasing functions of the SPP, indicating that the smaller the SPP is, the higher the PID gains are, and the better the robustness of PID control is. Simulation and experimental examples are provided to demonstrate the properties of the mapping as well as the effectiveness of the mapping based PID gain turning.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Event Simulation Tool for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Energy Systems: Advancing System Efficiency and Scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power systems face growing risks from cyber-physical attacks, necessitating enhanced resilience due to their societal function as critical infrastructures. The challenge is that defense of large-scale systems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment environment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission planning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable discrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE. The tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on power systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models packet flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using three well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000 buses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial topologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a communication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are incorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of the disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall network. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid network topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial structures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated with a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry Pi 5.</description>

      <title>How competitive are pay-as-bid auction games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the current structure of ancillary services markets, we study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with discriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are non-decreasing supply functions relating price to quantity and the exact choice of the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all non-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail to exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of Lipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist (under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine on their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz constant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the market-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal production costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we derive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed Lipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the pay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation and induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models based on uniform price auctions.</description>

      <title>ViMo: A Generative Visual GUI World Model for App Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: App agents, which autonomously operate mobile Apps through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), have gained significant interest in real-world applications. Yet, they often struggle with long-horizon planning, failing to find the optimal actions for complex tasks with longer steps. To address this, world models are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions, enabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models primarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential visual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model designed to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of generating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort readability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content generation. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text Representation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while preserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict future GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding text. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the outcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to generate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App agents to make more informed decisions.</description>

      <title>Prognosis Of Lithium-Ion Battery Health with Hybrid EKF-CNN+LSTM Model Using Differential Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery degradation is a major challenge in electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS). However, most degradation investigations focus mainly on estimating the state of charge (SOC), which fails to accurately interpret the cells' internal degradation mechanisms. Differential capacity analysis (DCA) focuses on the rate of change of cell voltage about the change in cell capacity, under various charge/discharge rates. This paper developed a battery cell degradation testing model that used two types of lithium-ions (Li-ion) battery cells, namely lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (LiNiCoAlO2) and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), to evaluate internal degradation during loading conditions. The proposed battery degradation model contains distinct charge rates (DCR) of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 1.5C, as well as discharge rates (DDR) of 0.5C, 0.9C, 1.3C, and 1.6C to analyze the internal health and performance of battery cells during slow, moderate, and fast loading conditions. Besides, this research proposed a model that incorporates the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to validate experimental data. The proposed model yields excellent modelling results based on mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), with errors of less than 0.001% at DCR and DDR. The peak identification technique (PIM) has been utilized to investigate battery health based on the number of peaks, peak position, peak height, peak area, and peak width. At last, the PIM method has discovered that the cell aged gradually under normal loading rates but deteriorated rapidly under fast loading conditions. Overall, LiFePO4 batteries perform more robustly and consistently than (LiNiCoAlO2) cells under varying loading conditions.</description>

      <title>PC-DeepNet: A GNSS Positioning Error Minimization Framework Using Permutation-Invariant Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) face significant challenges in urban and sub-urban areas due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and low received power levels, resulting in highly non-linear and non-Gaussian measurement error distributions. In light of this, conventional model-based positioning approaches, which rely on Gaussian error approximations, struggle to achieve precise localization under these conditions. To overcome these challenges, we put forth a novel learning-based framework, PC-DeepNet, that employs a permutation-invariant (PI) deep neural network (DNN) to estimate position corrections (PC). This approach is designed to ensure robustness against changes in the number and/or order of visible satellite measurements, a common issue in GNSS systems, while leveraging NLOS and multipath indicators as features to enhance positioning accuracy in challenging urban and sub-urban environments. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we compare the positioning error with state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based positioning methods using two publicly available datasets. The results confirm that proposed PC-DeepNet achieves superior accuracy than existing model-based and learning-based methods while exhibiting lower computational complexity compared to previous learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Orders for Entanglement Swapping in Path Graphs: A Greedy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator.</description>

      <title>Charging While Driving Lanes: A Boon to Electric Vehicle Owners or a Disruption to Traffic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale adoption of commercial and personal Electric Vehicles (EVs) is expected to significantly affect traffic flow dynamics, emissions, and energy consumption in the transportation sector. Range anxiety and challenges associated with charging EVs are among the key issues that reduce the adoption rate of EVs and, in turn, limit their system-level impacts. A promising solution to address these challenges is the introduction of charging while driving (CWD) lanes. Although technological advancements have made it possible to charge vehicles wirelessly while driving, introducing such lanes to the traffic stream can potentially disturb traffic flow and result in new congestion patterns. This study puts forward a framework to investigate the effects of CWD lanes on traffic flow, considering %autonomy, speed harmonization, and environmental factors for different market penetration rates (MPRs) of personal and commercial EVs. Different policies have been investigated to suggest the best design for CWD lanes. Results indicate that introducing CWD lanes can decrease overall traffic throughput and increase congestion due to additional lane-changing maneuvers by electric vehicles aiming to utilize the CWD lane. Although higher MPRs of EVs help stabilize traffic flow and reduce the number of shockwaves, speed disruption tends to increase in the CWD lane and propagate to adjacent lanes. Emission analyses show significant reductions (up to 63\%) in pollution levels with increasing MPRs of personal and commercial EVs. Our analysis shows that while CWD lanes can facilitate the adoption of EVs, they can deteriorate traffic efficiency, emphasizing the importance of careful design and policy considerations.</description>

      <title>Information Diffusion and Preferential Attachment in a Network of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper models information diffusion in a network of Large Language Models (LLMs) that is designed to answer queries from distributed datasets, where the LLMs can hallucinate the answer. We introduce a two-time-scale dynamical model for the centrally administered network, where opinions evolve faster while the network's degree distribution changes more slowly. Using a mean-field approximation, we establish conditions for a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium where all LLMs remain truthful. We provide approximation guarantees for the mean-field approximation and a singularly perturbed approximation of the two-time-scale system. To mitigate hallucination and improve the influence of truthful nodes, we propose a reputation-based preferential attachment mechanism that reconfigures the network based on LLMs' evaluations of their neighbors. Numerical experiments on an open-source LLM (LLaMA-3.1-8B) validate the efficacy of our preferential attachment mechanism and demonstrate the optimization of a cost function for the two-time-scale system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The matrix expressions for every parts of a transformer are firstly described. Based on semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices the hypervectors are reconsidered and the linear transformation over hypervectors is constructed by using projection. Its properties and calculating formulas are obtained. Using projection-based transformation of hypervector (PBTH), the framework of dimension-free transformer (DFT) is proposed by verifying each linear transformation in a transformer and replacing it by a proper PBTH, which allows the inputs and outputs being of arbitrary dimensions. Using balanced information about all entries, DFT must be more efficient in dealing with signals.</description>

      <title>Haptic-based Complementary Filter for Rigid Body Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-commutative nature of 3D rotations poses well-known challenges in generalizing planar problems to three-dimensional ones, even more so in contact-rich tasks where haptic information (i.e., forces/torques) is involved. In this sense, not all learning-based algorithms that are currently available generalize to 3D orientation estimation. Non-linear filters defined on $\mathbf{\mathbb{SO}(3)}$ are widely used with inertial measurement sensors; however, none of them have been used with haptic measurements. This paper presents a unique complementary filtering framework that interprets the geometric shape of objects in the form of superquadrics, exploits the symmetry of $\mathbf{\mathbb{SO}(3)}$, and uses force and vision sensors as measurements to provide an estimate of orientation. The framework's robustness and almost global stability are substantiated by a set of experiments on a dual-arm robotic setup.</description>

Abstract: As a high-level discipline, the development of remote sensing depends on the contribution of many other basic and applied disciplines and technologies. For example, due to the close relationship between remote sensing and photogrammetry, remote sensing would inevitably integrate disciplines such as optics and color science. Also, remote sensing integrates the knowledge of electronics in the conversion from optical signals to electrical signals via CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) or other image sensors. Moreover, when conducting object identification and classification with remote sensing data, mathematical morphology and other digital image processing technologies are used. These examples are only the tip of the iceberg of interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing. This work briefly reviews the interdisciplinary integration of remote sensing with four examples - ecology, mathematical morphology, machine learning, and electronics.</description>

      <title>HLSTester: Efficient Testing of Behavioral Discrepancies with LLMs for High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-level synthesis (HLS), C/C++ programs with synthesis directives are used to generate circuits for FPGA implementations. However, hardware-specific and platform-dependent characteristics in these implementations can introduce behavioral discrepancies between the original C/C++ programs and the circuits after high-level synthesis. Existing methods for testing behavioral discrepancies in HLS are still immature, and the testing workflow requires significant human efforts. To address this challenge, we propose HLSTester, a large language model (LLM) aided testing framework that efficiently detects behavioral discrepancies in HLS. To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and enhance prompt quality, the testbenches for original C/C++ programs are leveraged to guide LLMs in generating HLS-compatible testbenches, effectively eliminating certain traditional C/C++ constructs that are incompatible with HLS tools. Key variables are pinpointed through a backward slicing technique in both C/C++ and HLS programs to monitor their runtime spectra, enabling an in-depth analysis of the discrepancy symptoms. To reduce test time, a testing input generation mechanism is introduced to integrate dynamic mutation with insights from an LLM-based progressive reasoning chain. In addition, repetitive hardware testing is skipped by a redundancy-aware filtering technique for the generated test inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-aided testing framework significantly accelerates the testing workflow while achieving higher testbench simulation pass rates compared with the traditional method and the direct use of LLMs on the same HLS programs.</description>

      <title>Can We Ignore Labels In Out of Distribution Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods have recently become more prominent, serving as a core element in safety-critical autonomous systems. One major purpose of OOD detection is to reject invalid inputs that could lead to unpredictable errors and compromise safety. Due to the cost of labeled data, recent works have investigated the feasibility of self-supervised learning (SSL) OOD detection, unlabeled OOD detection, and zero shot OOD detection. In this work, we identify a set of conditions for a theoretical guarantee of failure in unlabeled OOD detection algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective. These conditions are present in all OOD tasks dealing with real-world data: I) we provide theoretical proof of unlabeled OOD detection failure when there exists zero mutual information between the learning objective and the in-distribution labels, a.k.a. 'label blindness', II) we define a new OOD task - Adjacent OOD detection - that tests for label blindness and accounts for a previously ignored safety gap in all OOD detection benchmarks, and III) we perform experiments demonstrating that existing unlabeled OOD methods fail under conditions suggested by our label blindness theory and analyze the implications for future research in unlabeled OOD methods.</description>

      <title>Safe Autonomous Environmental Contact for Soft Robots using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots built from soft materials will inherently apply lower environmental forces than their rigid counterparts, and therefore may be more suitable in sensitive settings with unintended contact. However, these robots' applied forces result from both their design and their control system in closed-loop, and therefore, ensuring bounds on these forces requires controller synthesis for safety as well. This article introduces the first feedback controller for a soft manipulator that formally meets a safety specification with respect to environmental contact. In our proof-of-concept setting, the robot's environment has known geometry and is deformable with a known elastic modulus. Our approach maps a bound on applied forces to a safe set of positions of the robot's tip via predicted deformations of the environment. Then, a quadratic program with Control Barrier Functions in its constraints is used to supervise a nominal feedback signal, verifiably maintaining the robot's tip within this safe set. Hardware experiments on a multi-segment soft pneumatic robot demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully constrains its environmental contact forces. This framework represents a fundamental shift in perspective on control and safety for soft robots, defining and implementing a formally verifiable logic specification on their pose and contact forces.</description>

      <title>Never too Cocky to Cooperate: An FIM and RL-based USV-AUV Collaborative System for Underwater Tasks in Extreme Sea Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) collaborative system designed to enhance underwater task performance in extreme sea conditions. The system integrates a dual strategy: (1) high-precision multi-AUV localization enabled by Fisher information matrix-optimized USV path planning, and (2) reinforcement learning-based cooperative planning and control method for multi-AUV task execution. Extensive experimental evaluations in the underwater data collection task demonstrate the system's operational feasibility, with quantitative results showing significant performance improvements over baseline methods. The proposed system exhibits robust coordination capabilities between USV and AUVs while maintaining stability in extreme sea conditions. To facilitate reproducibility and community advancement, we provide an open-source simulation toolkit available at: https://github.com/360ZMEM/USV-AUV-colab .</description>

      <title>Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to these as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under a separability assumption on cost functions, we formulate FSN solutions recursively using a dynamic programming-like approach. We further show that the FSN solution for these constrained games can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game with only sequential interactions, given parameter choices that satisfy implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that the FSN solutions are obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results with a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal Behavior Planning for Implicit Communication using a Probabilistic Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and crossing pedestrians, modeling implicit vehicle communication is crucial. In this work, we present a combined prediction and planning approach that allows to consider the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on a pedestrian and predict a pedestrian's reaction. We plan the behavior by solving two consecutive optimal control problems (OCPs) analytically, using variational calculus. We perform a validation step that assesses whether the planned vehicle behavior is adequate to trigger a certain pedestrian reaction, which accounts for the closed-loop characteristics of prediction and planning influencing each other. In this step, we model the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on the pedestrian using a probabilistic behavior acceptance model that returns an estimate for the crossing probability. The probabilistic modeling of the pedestrian reaction facilitates considering the pedestrian's costs, thereby improving cooperative behavior planning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in simulated vehicle-pedestrian interactions with varying initial settings and highlight the decision making capabilities of the planning approach.</description>

      <title>Fully Adaptive Stepsizes: Which System Benefit More -- Centralized or Decentralized?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT generates a sequence of iterates that converges to the optimal consensus solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automation of robotic systems for servicing in cislunar space is becoming extremely important as the number of satellites in orbit increases. Safety is critical in performing satellite maintenance, so the control techniques utilized must be trusted in addition to being highly efficient. In this work, Genetic Fuzzy Trees are combined with the widely used LQR control scheme via Thales' TrUE AI Toolkit to create a trusted and efficient controller for a two-degree-of-freedom planar robotic manipulator that would theoretically be used to perform satellite maintenance. It was found that Genetic Fuzzy-LQR is 18.5% more performant than optimal LQR on average, and that it is incredibly robust to uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Stop-and-go wave super-resolution reconstruction via iterative refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves are a fundamental phenomenon in freeway traffic flow, contributing to inefficiencies, crashes, and emissions. Recent advancements in high-fidelity sensor technologies have improved the ability to capture detailed traffic dynamics, yet such systems remain scarce and costly. In contrast, conventional traffic sensors are widely deployed but suffer from relatively coarse-grain data resolution, potentially impeding accurate analysis of stop-and-go waves. This article explores whether generative AI models can enhance the resolution of conventional traffic sensor to approximate the quality of high-fidelity observations. We present a novel approach using a conditional diffusion denoising model, designed to reconstruct fine-grained traffic speed field from radar-based conventional sensors via iterative refinement. We introduce a new dataset, I24-WaveX, comprising 132 hours of data from both low and high-fidelity sensor systems, totaling over 2 million vehicle miles traveled. Our approach leverages this dataset to formulate the traffic measurement enhancement problem as a spatio-temporal super-resolution task. We demonstrate that our model can effectively reproduce the patterns of stop-and-go waves, achieving high accuracy in capturing these critical traffic dynamics. Our results show promising advancements in traffic data enhancement, offering a cost-effective way to leverage existing low spatio-temporal resolution sensor networks for improved traffic analysis and management. We also open-sourced our trained model and code to facilitate further research and applications.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal Model Reduction of Linear Quadratic Output Systems in Finite Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In frequency-limited model order reduction, the objective is to maintain the frequency response of the original system within a specified frequency range in the reduced-order model. In this paper, a mathematical expression for the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm is derived, which quantifies the error within the desired frequency interval. Subsequently, the necessary conditions for a local optimum of the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the error are derived. The inherent difficulty in satisfying these conditions within a Petrov-Galerkin projection framework is also discussed. Using the optimality conditions and the Petrov-Galerkin projection, a stationary point iteration algorithm is proposed, which approximately satisfies these optimality conditions upon convergence. The main computational effort in the proposed algorithm involves solving sparse-dense Sylvester equations. These equations are frequently encountered in $\mathcal{H}_2$ model order reduction algorithms and can be solved efficiently. Moreover, the algorithm bypasses the requirement of matrix logarithm computation, which is typically necessary for most frequency-limited reduction methods and can be computationally demanding for high-order systems. An illustrative example is provided to numerically validate the developed theory. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness in accurately approximating the original high-order model within the specified frequency range is demonstrated through the reduction of an advection-diffusion equation-based model, commonly used in model reduction literature for testing algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm's computational efficiency is highlighted by successfully reducing a flexible space structure model of order one million.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent years, we have observed three significant trends in control systems: a renewed interest in data-driven control design, the abundance of cloud computational services and the importance of preserving privacy for the system under control. Motivated by these factors, this work investigates privacy-preserving outsourcing for the design of a stabilizing controller for unknown linear time-invariant systems.The main objective of this research is to preserve the privacy for the system dynamics by designing an outsourcing mechanism. To achieve this goal, we propose a scheme that combines transformation-based techniques and robust data-driven control design methods. The scheme preserves the privacy of both the open-loop and closed-loop system matrices while stabilizing the system under control.The scheme is applicable to both data with and without disturbance and is lightweight in terms of computational overhead. Numerical investigations for a case study demonstrate the impacts of our mechanism and its role in hindering malicious adversaries from achieving their goals.</description>

      <title>Replacing K-infinity Function with Leaky ReLU in Barrier Function Design: A Union of Invariant Sets Approach for ReLU-Based Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a systematic framework is presented for determining piecewise affine PWA barrier functions and their corresponding invariant sets for dynamical systems identified via Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) neural networks or their equivalent PWA representations. A common approach to determining the invariant set is to use Nagumo's condition, or to utilize the barrier function with a class K-infinity function. It may be challenging to find a suitable class K-infinity function in some cases. We propose leaky ReLU as an efficient substitute for the complex nonlinear K-infinity function in our formulation. Moreover, we propose the Union of Invariant Sets (UIS) method, which combines information from multiple invariant sets in order to compute the largest possible PWA invariant set. The proposed framework is validated through multiple examples, showcasing its potential to enhance the analysis of invariant sets in ReLU-based dynamical systems.

      <title>Large Banks and Systemic Risk: Insights from a Mean-Field Game Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic game framework to analyze the role of large banks in interbank markets. By extending existing models, we incorporate a large bank as a dynamic decision-maker interacting with multiple small banks. Using the mean-field game methodology and convex analysis, best-response trading strategies are derived, leading to an approximate equilibrium for the interbank market. We investigate the influence of the large bank on the market stability by examining individual default probabilities and systemic risk, through the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal that, when the size of the major bank is not excessively large, it can positively contribute to market stability. However, there is also the potential for negative spillover effects in the event of default, leading to an increase in systemic risk. The magnitude of this impact is further influenced by the size and trading rate of the major bank. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the management of systemic risk in interbank markets.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Routing Algorithm for Mobile Ground-to-Air Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of energy-constrained planning for a cooperative system of an Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). In scenarios where the UGV serves as a mobile base to ferry the UAV and as a charging station to recharge the UAV, we formulate a novel energy-constrained routing problem. To tackle this problem, we design an energy-aware routing algorithm, aiming to minimize the overall mission duration under the energy limitations of both vehicles. The algorithm first solves a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to generate a guided tour. Then, it employs the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to refine the tour and generate paths for the two vehicles. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through extensive simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment. The results show that our algorithm consistently achieves near-optimal mission time and maintains fast running time across a wide range of problem instances.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model reduction of dynamical systems with root mean squared error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning SSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An adaptive controller is proposed and analyzed for the class of infinite-horizon optimal control problems in positive linear systems presented in (Ohlin et al., 2024b). This controller is derived from the solution of a "data-driven algebraic equation" constructed using the model-free Bellman equation from Q-learning. The equation is driven by data correlation matrices that do not scale with the number of data points, enabling efficient online implementation. Consequently, a sufficient condition guaranteeing stability and robustness to unmodeled dynamics is established. The derived results also provide a quantitative characterization of the interplay between excitation level and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal control problems considered here is equivalent to Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed adaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest path, as demonstrated in the numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Interpretation of the Internal Model Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of ``model'' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories, a notion of ``interpretation'', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Services Architecture for Efficient Airspace Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting air traffic congestion and flow management is essential for airlines and Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) to enhance operational efficiency. Accurate estimates of future airport capacity and airspace density are vital for better airspace management, reducing air traffic controller workload and fuel consumption, ultimately promoting sustainable aviation. While existing literature has addressed these challenges, data management and query processing remain complex due to the vast volume of high-rate air traffic data. Many analytics use cases require a common pre-processing infrastructure, as ad-hoc approaches are insufficient. Additionally, linear prediction models often fall short, necessitating more advanced techniques.
  This paper presents a data processing and predictive services architecture that ingests large, uncorrelated, and noisy streaming data to forecast future airspace system states. The system continuously collects raw data, periodically compresses it, and stores it in NoSQL databases for efficient query processing. For prediction, the system learns from historical traffic by extracting key features such as airport arrival and departure events, sector boundary crossings, weather parameters, and other air traffic data. These features are input into various regression models, including linear, non-linear, and ensemble models, with the best-performing model selected for predictions. We evaluate this infrastructure across three prediction use cases in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and a segment of European airspace, using extensive real operations data, confirming that our system can predict future system states efficiently and accurately.</description>
