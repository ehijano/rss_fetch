      <title>Friedman-Ramanujan functions in random hyperbolic geometry and application to spectral gaps II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core focus of this series of two articles is the study of the distribution of the length spectrum of closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$, sampled randomly with respect to the Weil-Petersson probability measure. In the first article, we introduced a notion of local topological type $T$, and established the existence of a density function $V_g^T(l)$ describing the distribution of the lengths of all closed geodesics of type $T$ in a genus $g$ hyperbolic surface. We proved that $V_g^T(l)$ admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/g$. We introduced a new class of functions, called Friedman-Ramanujan functions, and related it to the study of the spectral gap $\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian.
  In this second part, we provide a variety of new tools allowing to compute and estimate the volume functions $V_g^T(l)$. Notably, we construct new sets of coordinates on Teichm\"uller spaces, distinct from Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, in which the Weil-Petersson volume has a simple form. These coordinates are tailored to the geodesics we study, and we can therefore prove nice formulae for their lengths. We use these new ideas, together with a notion of pseudo-convolutions, to prove that the coefficients of the expansion of $V_g^T(l)$ in powers of $1/g$ are Friedman-Ramanujan functions, for any local topological type $T$. We then exploit this result to prove that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, $\lambda_1 \geq \frac14 - \epsilon$ with probability going to one as $g \rightarrow + \infty$, or, in other words, typical hyperbolic surfaces have an asymptotically optimal spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of dynamical coverings under mixing properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we estimate the Hausdorff dimension of dynamical coverings with respect to mixing ergodic systems. More precisely, if the ergodic measure is exact-dimensionnal, we establish a formula provided that the system is polynomially fast mixing and if the measure is not exact-dimensionnal, we establish a similar result under super-polynomial speed of mix assumpetion. As an application of our result, we extend the result of Fan-Shmeling-Troubetzkoy for the doubling map on the circle to the case of the times 2, times 3 map on the two dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>Relative Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of optimal transport relative to a distinguished subset, which acts as a reservoir of mass, allowing us to compare measures of different total variation. This relative transportation problem has an optimal solution and we obtain relative versions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality and Monge-Kantorovich duality. We also prove relative versions of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, which connect the spaces of measures arising from the relative optimal transport problem to spaces of Lipschitz functions. For a boundedly compact Polish space, we show that our relative 1-finite real-valued Radon measures with relative Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm coincide with the sequentially order continuous dual of relative Lipschitz functions with the operator norm. As part of our work we develop a theory of Riesz cones that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Topological Optimal Transport for Geometric Cycle Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis is a powerful tool for describing topological signatures in real world data. An important challenge in topological data analysis is matching significant topological signals across distinct systems. In geometry and probability theory, optimal transport formalises notions of distance and matchings between distributions and structured objects. We propose to combine these approaches, constructing a mathematical framework for optimal transport-based matchings of topological features. Building upon recent advances in the domains of persistent homology and optimal transport for hypergraphs, we develop a transport-based methodology for topological data processing. We define measure topological networks, which integrate both geometric and topological information about a system, introduce a distance on the space of these objects, and study its metric properties, showing that it induces a geodesic metric space of non-negative curvature. The resulting Topological Optimal Transport (TpOT) framework provides a transport model on point clouds that minimises topological distortion while simultaneously yielding a geometrically informed matching between persistent homology cycles.</description>

      <title>Topological Erd\H{o}s similarity conjecture and strong measure zero sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve the topological version of the Erd\H{o}s Similarity conjecture introduced previously by Gallagher, Lai and Weber. We show that a set is topologically universal on ${\mathbb R}$ if and only if it is of strong measure zero. As a result of the fact that the Borel conjecture is independent of the \textsf{ZFC} axiomatic set theory, the existence of an uncountable topologically universal set is independent of the \textsf{ZFC}. Moreover, our results can also be generalized to locally compact Polish groups ${\mathbb G}$. Returning to the measure side, we pose Full-Measure universal Erd\H{o}s Similarity Conjecture with strongly meager sets via the duality of measure and category.</description>
