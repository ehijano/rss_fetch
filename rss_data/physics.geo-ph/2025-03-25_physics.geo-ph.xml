      <title>Absence of dehydration due to superionic transition at Earth's core-mantle boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties and stability of hydrous phases are key to unraveling the mysteries of the water cycle in Earth's interior. Under the deep lower mantle conditions, hydrous phases transition into a superionic state. However, the influence of the superionic effect on their stability and dehydration processes remains poorly understood. Using ab initio calculations and deep-learning potential molecular dynamics simulations, we discovered a doubly superionic transition in delta-AlOOH, characterized by the highly diffusive behavior of ionic hydrogen and aluminum within the oxygen sub-lattice. These highly diffusive elements contribute significant external entropy into the system, resulting in exceptional thermostability. Free energy calculations indicate that dehydration is energetically and kinetically unfavorable when water exists in a superionic state under core-mantle boundary (CMB) conditions. Consequently, water can accumulate in the deep lower mantle over Earth's history. This deep water reservoir plays a crucial role in the global deep water and hydrogen cycles.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Benefits of Neural Network Parameterizations in Geophysical Inversions: A Study With Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ neural fields, which use neural networks to map a coordinate to the corresponding physical property value at that coordinate, in a test-time learning manner. For a test-time learning method, the weights are learned during the inversion, as compared to traditional approaches which require a network to be trained using a training data set. Results for synthetic examples in seismic tomography and direct current resistivity inversions are shown first. We then perform a singular value decomposition analysis on the Jacobian of the weights of the neural network (SVD analysis) for both cases to explore the effects of neural networks on the recovered model. The results show that the test-time learning approach can eliminate unwanted artifacts in the recovered subsurface physical property model caused by the sensitivity of the survey and physics. Therefore, NFs-Inv improves the inversion results compared to the conventional inversion in some cases such as the recovery of the dip angle or the prediction of the boundaries of the main target. In the SVD analysis, we observe similar patterns in the left-singular vectors as were observed in some diffusion models, trained in a supervised manner, for generative tasks in computer vision. This observation provides evidence that there is an implicit bias, which is inherent in neural network structures, that is useful in supervised learning and test-time learning models. This implicit bias has the potential to be useful for recovering models in geophysical inversions.</description>

      <title>Development of portable cosmic-ray muon detector array for muography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the multidisciplinary applications of cosmic-ray muons expand to large-scale and wide-area scenarios, the construction of cosmic-ray muon detector arrays has become a key solution to overcome the hardware limitations of individual detector. For muography, the array-based detector design enables fast-scanning of large target objects, allowing for rapid identification of density variation regions, which can improve the efficiency of tomography. This paper integrates scintillator detector technology with Internet of things (IoT) technology, proposing a novel array networking model for nationwide deployment. The model enables long-distance data collection and distribution, laying the foundation for future multidisciplinary applications such as muography and other fields.</description>
