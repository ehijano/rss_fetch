      <title>Pan-African Asteroid Search Campaign: Africa's Contribution to Planetary Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroid search is a global effort for planetary defense. The International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC) is the leading global educational outreach program that provides high-quality astronomical datasets to citizen scientists to discover asteroids. Since December 4, 2020, the Pan-African Citizen Science e-Lab (PACS e-Lab) has been IASC's biggest partner on the continent in recruiting and training citizen scientists in asteroid search endeavors. Over 30 asteroids have been discovered by 60 citizen scientists. About 595 citizen scientists from over 40 countries have been engaged in the project up to the time of composing this literature. The group is set to expand its endeavors to the rest of the continent and aims to engage thousands of citizen scientists.</description>

      <title>Generative Design of Periodic Orbits in the Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Three-Body Problem has fascinated scientists for centuries and it has been crucial in the design of modern space missions. Recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence hold transformative promise for addressing this longstanding problem. This work investigates the use of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and its internal representation to generate periodic orbits. We utilize a comprehensive dataset of periodic orbits in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) to train deep-learning architectures that capture key orbital characteristics, and we set up physical evaluation metrics for the generated trajectories. Through this investigation, we seek to enhance the understanding of how Generative AI can improve space mission planning and astrodynamics research, leading to novel, data-driven approaches in the field.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Spectroscopic Characterization of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 19467 B with the NIRSpec Integral Field Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the atmospheric characterization of the substellar companion HD 19467 B as part of the pioneering JWST GTO program to obtain moderate resolution spectra (R$\sim$2,700, 3-5$\mu$m) of a high-contrast companion with the NIRSpec IFU. HD 19467 B is an old, $\sim$9 Gyr, companion to a Solar-type star with multiple measured dynamical masses. The spectra show detections of CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O. We forward model the spectra using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and atmospheric model grids to constrain the effective temperature and surface gravity. We then use NEWERA-PHOENIX grids to constrain non-equilibrium chemistry parameterized by $K_{zz}$ and explore molecular abundance ratios of the detected molecules. We find an effective temperature of 1103 K, with a probable range from 1000--1200 K, a surface gravity of 4.50 dex, with a range of 4.14--5.00, and deep vertical mixing, log$_{10}$($K_{zz}$), of 5.03, with a range of 5.00--5.44. All molecular mixing ratios are approximately Solar, leading to a C/O $\sim$0.55, which is expected from a T5.5 brown dwarf. Finally, we calculate an updated dynamical mass of HD 19467 B using newly derived NIRCam astrometry which we find to be $71.6^{+5.3}_{-4.6} M_{\rm{Jup}}$, in agreement with the mass range we derive from evolutionary models, which we find to be 63-75 $M_{\rm{Jup}}$.These observations demonstrate the excellent capabilities of the NIRSpec IFU to achieve detailed spectral characterization of substellar companions at high-contrast close to bright host stars, in this case at a separation of $\sim$1.6\arcsec with a contrast of 10$^{-4}$ in the 3-5 $\mu$m range.</description>

      <title>Planet Formation Imager (PFI): Project update and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) Project is dedicated to defining a next-generation facility that can answer fundamental questions about how planets form, including detection of young giant exoplanets and their circumplanetary disks. The proposed expansive design for a 12-element array of 8m class telescopes with &gt;1.2 km baselines would indeed revolutionize our understanding of planet formation and is technically achievable, albeit at a high cost. It has been 10 years since this conceptual design process began and we give an overview of the status of the PFI project. We also review how a scaled back PFI with fewer large telescopes could answer a range of compelling science questions, including in planet formation and as well as totally different astrophysics areas. New opportunities make a space-based PFI more feasible now and we give a brief overview of new efforts that could also pave the way for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) space mission.</description>

      <title>Exploring Systematic Errors in the Inferred Parameters of the Transiting Planet KELT-15b and its Host Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transiting planet systems offer a unique opportunity to measure the masses and radii of many planets and their host stars. Yet, relative photometry and radial velocity measurements alone only constrain the density of the host star. In remedy, the community uses theoretical and semi-empirical methods to break this one-parameter degeneracy and measure the mass and radius of the host star and its planet(s). We investigate the differences in the inferred system parameters due to modeling a host star with the Torres mass-radius relations, YY evolutionary tracks, MIST evolutionary tracks, and a stellar radius estimate from the spectral energy distribution (SED). We consider the effects of different priors on the stellar effective temperature, limb darkening, and eccentricity of the planet. Using the publicly available software package EXOFASTv2, we globally model TESS photometry and radial velocity observations of KELT-15, which hosts a fairly representative hot Jupiter. In total, we explore the impact of 28 different choices of priors on the inferred parameters of KELT-15b. We find broad agreement in the inferred system parameters across methodologies at the level of ~1.1 sigma between the MIST and SED constraints. This gives some confidence that systematic errors are not ubiquitous in transiting planets systems. We also find a ~2 sigma difference in the stellar radius estimated by the MIST models when we adopt differing literature spectroscopic effective temperature estimates. Similar studies of a large number of systems are needed to definitely assess systematic uncertainties the exoplanet population as a whole.</description>

      <title>How Land-Mass Distribution Influences the Atmospheric Dynamics of Tidally Locked Terrestrial Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretation of the ongoing efforts to simulate the atmospheres of potentially-habitable terrestrial exoplanets requires that we understand the underlying dynamics and chemistry of such objects to a much greater degree than 1D or even simple 3D models enable. Here, for the tidally-locked habitable-zone planet TRAPPIST-1e, we explore one effect which can shape the dynamics and chemistry of terrestrial planets: the inclusion of an Earth-like land-ocean distribution with orography. To do this we use the Earth-system model WACCM6/CESM2 to run a pair of TRAPPIST-1e models with N$_2$-O$_2$ atmospheres and with the sub-stellar point fixed over either land or ocean. The presence of orography shapes atmospheric transport, and in the case of Earth-like orography, breaks the symmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres which was previously found in slab ocean models. For example, peak zonal jet speeds in the southern hemisphere are $50\rightarrow100\%$ faster than similar jets in the northern hemisphere. This also affects the meridional circulation, transporting equatorial material towards the south-pole. As a result we also find significant changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including the accumulation of potentially lethal quantities of ozone at both the south pole and the surface. Future studies which investigate the effects of land-mass distribution on the dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres should pay close attention to both the day-side land-fraction as well as the orography of the land. Simply modelling a flat land-mass will not give a complete picture of its dynamical impact.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-0845L: A low-mass M dwarf from the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0845, which was affected by both the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects. The former was detected via the simultaneous observations from the ground and Spitzer, and the latter was caused by the orbital motion of the source star in a relatively close binary. The combination of these two effects led to a mass measurement of the lens object, revealing a low-mass ($0.14 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$) M-dwarf at the bulge distance ($7.6 \pm 1.0$ kpc). The source binary consists of a late F-type subgiant and a K-type dwarf of $\sim1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 0.9 M_{\odot}$, respectively, and the orbital period is $70 \pm 10$ days. OGLE-2015-BLG-0845 is the first single-lens event in which the lens mass is measured via the binarity of the source. Given the abundance of binary systems as potential microlensing sources, the xallarap effect may not be a rare phenomenon. Our work thus highlights the application of the xallarap effect in the mass determination of microlenses, and the same method can be used to identify isolated dark lenses.</description>
