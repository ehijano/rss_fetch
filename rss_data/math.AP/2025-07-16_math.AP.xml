      <title>Absence of $L^p$ spectrum for asymptotically flat diffusions in region with cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions to variable-coefficient elliptic equations of the form $-\D(A(x) \nabla u) = \kappa u$, $\kappa&gt;0$, in an exterior domain $\Om\subset \Rn$, where $A(x)$ is uniformly elliptic and asymptotically flat. Extending Rellich's classical $L^2$ result for the Laplacian, we show that if $u\in L^p(\Om)$ for some $0&lt;p&lt;\frac{2n}{n-1}$, then $u\equiv 0$. The proof uses new monotonicity formulas based on weighted energies and vector fields adapted to the geometry of $A(x)$. Our results highlight a sharper integrability threshold in the variable-coefficient setting.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint extensions for the Laplacian operator on non-compacts graphs and the existence and stability of standing waves for NLS models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we first study a systematic way to describe the unitary dynamics of the Schr\"odinger operator on a looping-edge graphs $\mathcal{G}$ (a graph consisting of a circle and a finite amount $N$ of infinite half-lines attached to a common vertex). We also apply our approach on $\mathcal T$-shaped graphs (metric graphs that consists of a pendant edge and a finite amount of half-lines attached to the common vertex). In both cases we obtain novel boundary conditions on the unique vertex that guarantee self-adjointness of the Laplacian operator and therefore unitary dynamics for the linear Schr\"odinger equation on both, looping-edge and $\mathcal{T}$-shaped graphs. In the second part, as an application of our abstract results, we discuss the existence and orbital (in)stability of some traveling waves for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odiner equation posed on $\mathcal{G}$ with interactions of $\delta'$-type with strength $Z&lt;0$ (continuity at the vertex is not required). We propose a dnoidal-profile in the circle with soliton tail-profiles on the half-lines and establish the existence and (in)stability depending on the relative size $N$ and $Z$.</description>

      <title>First critical field in the pinned three dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extreme type-II superconductors described by the three dimensional magnetic Ginzburg-Landau functional incorporating a pinning term $a_\varepsilon(x)$, which we assume to be a bounded measurable function satisfying $b\leq a_\varepsilon(x)\leq 1$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. A hallmark of such materials is the formation of vortex filaments, which emerge when the applied magnetic field exceeds the first critical field $H_{c_1}$. In this work, we provide a lower bound for this critical field and provide a characterization of the Meissner solution, that is, the unique vortexless configuration that globally minimizes the energy below $H_{c_1}$. Moreover, we show that the onset of vorticity is intrinsically linked to a weighted variant of the isoflux problem studied in [C. Rom\'an, On the First Critical Field in the Three Dimensional Ginzburg-Landau Model of Superconductivity, Comm. Math. Phys. 367 (2019), no.1, 317--349. arXiv:1802.09390] and [C. Rom\'an, \'E. Sandier and S. Serfaty, Bounded vorticity for the 3D Ginzburg-Landau model and an isoflux problem, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (3) 126 (2023), no.3, 1015--1062. arXiv:2110.06858]. A crucial role is played by the $\varepsilon$-level tools developed in [C. Rom\'an, Three dimensional vortex approximation construction and $\varepsilon$-level estimates for the Ginzburg-Landau functional, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 231 (2019), no.3, 1531--1614. arXiv:1712.07604], which we adapt to the weighted Ginzburg-Landau framework.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Characterizations and Their Applications of Solvability of $L^p$ Poisson--Robin(-Regularity) Problems on Rough Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\ge2$, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded one-sided chord arc domain, and $p\in(1,\infty)$. In this article, we study the (weak) $L^p$ Poisson--Robin(-regularity) problem for a uniformly elliptic operator $L:=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla\cdot)$ of divergence form on $\Omega$, which considers weak solutions to the equation $Lu=h-\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{F}$ in $\Omega$ with the Robin boundary condition $A\nabla u\cdot\boldsymbol{\nu}+\alpha u=\boldsymbol{F}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nu}$ on the boundary $\partial\Omega$ for functions $h$ and $\boldsymbol{F}$ in some tent spaces. Precisely, we establish several equivalent characterizations of the solvability of the (weak) $L^p$ Poisson--Robin(-regularity) problem and clarify the relationship between the $L^p$ Poisson--Robin(-regularity) problem and the classical $L^p$ Robin problem. Moreover, we also give an extrapolation property for the solvability of the classical $L^p$ Robin problem. As applications, we further prove that, for the Laplace operator $-\Delta$ on the bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, the $L^p$ Poisson--Robin and the $L^q$ Poisson--Robin-regularity problems are respectively solvable for $p\in(2-\varepsilon_1,\infty)$ and $q\in(1,2+\varepsilon_2)$, where $\varepsilon_1\in(0,1]$ and $\varepsilon_2\in(0,\infty)$ are constants depending only on $n$ and the Lipschitz constant of $\Omega$ and, moreover, these ranges $(2-\varepsilon_1,\infty)$ of $p$ and $(1,2+\varepsilon_2)$ of $q$ are sharp. The main results in this article are the analogues of the corresponding results of both the $L^p$ Poisson--Dirichlet(-regularity) problem, established by M. Mourgoglou, B. Poggi and X. Tolsa [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 2025], and of the $L^p$ Poisson--Neumann(-regularity) problem, established by J. Feneuil and L. Li [arXiv: 2406.16735], in the Robin case.</description>

      <title>The motion of a rigid body in a viscous fluid: new results for strong solutions, uniqueness and integrability properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show two results in the setting of Galdi-Silvestre strong solutions for the rigid body-viscous fluid interaction. The former, under an additional integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data, proves that the time derivative of the solution belongs to $L^2(0,T;L^2({\Omega}))$. The latter, thanks to a further assumption only on one solution, proves that the uniqueness holds in the quoted setting. However, our extra assumption for the uniqueness is certainly verified under the integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data. Hence, the set of solutions enjoying the uniqueness is not empty.</description>

      <title>Non-autonomous semilinear fractional evolution equations: well-posedness and ultracontractivity results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-fractional semilinear parabolic abstract Cauchy problem for a time-dependent sectorial operator $A(t)$ which satisfies the Acquistapace-Terreni conditions. We first prove local existence results for the mild solution of the problem at hand. Then we prove, under suitable assumptions on the initial datum, that the solution is also global in time. This is achieved by proving ultracontractivity estimates for the fractional evolution families associated with the operator $A(t)$.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic limit of ground states to $L^2$-supercritical nonlinear Dirac equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and nonrelativistic limit of normalized ground states for the following nonlinear Dirac equation with power-type potentials \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} &amp;-i c\sum\limits_{k=1}^3\alpha_k\partial_k u +mc^2 \beta {u}- |{u}|^{p-2}{u}=\omega {u}, \\ &amp;\displaystyle\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\vert u \vert^2 dx =1.
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} We demonstrate the existence of ground states for large $c$ and establish the uniqueness of the associated Lagrange multiplier for all $p \in (2,3)$. In particular, the case for $p \in (8/3, 3)$, often referred to as $L^2$-supercritical and posing significant challenges to existing methods, is primarily addressed in this paper. Furthermore, in the nonrelativistic limit as $c \to \infty$, we observe that the first two components of the Dirac ground states converge to Schr\"odinger ground states, while the last two components vanish for all $p\in (2,3)$. This convergence is related to the action of $SU(2)$.</description>

      <title>Mode stability for self-similar blowup of slightly supercritical NLS: I. low-energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider self-similar blowup for (NLS) $i\partial_t u + \Delta u + u|u|^{p-1} = 0$ in $d \ge 1$ and slightly mass-supercritical range $0 &lt; s_c := \frac d2 - \frac{2}{p-1} \ll 1$. The existence and stability of such dynamics [Merle-Rapha\"el-Szeftel, 2010] and construction of suitable profiles [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] lead to the question of asymptotic stability. Based on our previous work [Li, 2023], this nonlinear problem is reduced to linear mode stability of the matrix linearized operator. In this work, we prove mode stability for the low-energy spectrum in $d \ge 1$ as a perturbation of the linearized operator around ground state for mass-critical NLS. The main difficulty of this spectral bifurcation problem arises from the non-self-adjoint, relatively unbounded and high-dimensional nature, for which we exploit the Jost function argument from [Perelman, 2001], qualitative WKB analysis generalized from [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021], matched asymptotics method and uniform estimates for high spherical classes based on special functions.</description>

      <title>Mode stability for self-similar blowup of slightly supercritical NLS: II. high-energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuation of the study of the companion work, we prove the high-energy mode stability for linearized operator around self-similar profiles in [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] for slightly mass-supercritical NLS in $1 \le d \le 10$. This concludes the asymptotic stability of such self-similar blowup, and answers the question from [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] and [Merle-Rapha\"el-Szeftel, 2010]. As a byproduct, we characterize the spectrum for linearized operator around mass-critical ground state for $1 \le d \le 10$, which could be useful for future studies of asymptotic behavior near ground state. The core idea is a linear Liouville argument, originated by Martel-Merle [Martel-Merle, 2000, 2001] studying soliton stability, to reformulate the eigen problem as rigidity of linear dynamics so as to introduce modulation and to apply nonlinear dynamical controls. Our controlling quantities were verified with numerical help in [Merle-Rapha\"el, 2005; Fibich-Merle-Rapha\"el, 2006; Yang-Roudenko-Zhao, 2018] for $1 \le d \le 10$.</description>

      <title>Effects of rough boundary and nonzero boundary conditions on the lubrication process with micropolar fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lubrication theory is mostly concerned with the behavior of a lubricant flowing through a narrow gap. Motivated by the experimental findings from the tribology literature, we take the lubricant to be micropolar fluid and study its behavior in a thin domain with rough boundary. Instead of considering (commonly used) simple zero boundary condition, we impose physically relevant (nonzero) boundary condition for microrotation and perform asymptotic analysis of the corresponding 3D boundary value problem. We formally derive a simplified mathematical model acknowledging the roughness-induced effects and the effects of the nonzero boundary conditions on the macroscopic flow. Using the obtained asymptotic model, we study numerically the influence of the specific rugosity profile on the performance of a linear slider bearing. The numerical results clearly indicate that the use of the rough surfaces may contribute to enhance the mechanical performance of such device.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pointwise Statistics in Hyperbolic Equations with Random Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional hyperbolic PDEs, linear and nonlinear, with random initial data. Our focus is the {\em pointwise statistics,} i.e., the probability measure of the solution at any fixed point in space and time. For linear hyperbolic equations, the probability density function (PDF) of these statistics satisfies the same linear PDE. For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we derive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF. Both results are valid only as long as no shocks have formed, a limitation which is inherent to the problem, as demonstrated by a counterexample. For systems of linear hyperbolic equations, we introduce the multi-point statistics and derive their evolution equations. In all of the settings we consider, the resulting PDEs for the statistics are of practical significance: they enable efficient evaluation of the random dynamics, without requiring an ensemble of solutions of the underlying PDE, and their cost is not affected by the dimension of the random parameter space. Additionally, the evolution equations for the statistics lead to a priori statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods (in particular, Kernel Density Estimators) when applied to hyperbolic PDEs with random data.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic RAGE Theorem and Enhanced Dissipation for Transport Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a stochastic version of the classical RAGE theorem that applies to the two-point motion generated by noisy transport equations. As a consequence, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition for the corresponding diffusive equation to be dissipation enhancing. This involves the identification of a non-trivial, finite dimensional subspace that is invariant for the family of self-adjoint operator characterizing the structure of the transport noise. We discuss several examples and prove a sharp enhanced dissipation rate for stochastic shear flows.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the existence and uniqueness of solutions for second-order semi-linear partial differential equations defined on a Riemannian manifold $M$. By combining differential geometry and analysis techniques, we establish the existence and uniqueness of constant solutions through the orbits of a group action. Our approach transforms such problems into equivalent ones over a submanifold $\Sigma$ of dimension one, which is transversal to the group action. This reduction leads us to a one-dimensional setting, where we can apply different results from the theory of ordinary differential equations. Our framework is versatile and includes the setups of polar actions or exponential coordinates, with particular examples such as the sphere, surfaces of revolution, and others.</description>

      <title>Decay character theory for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems of balance laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partially dissipative systems that characterize many physical phenomena were first pointed out by Godunov (1961), then investigated by Friedrichs-Lax (1971) who introduced the convex entropy, and later by Shizuta-Kawashima (1984,1985) who initiated a simple sufficient criterion ensuring the global existence of smooth solutions and their large-time asymptotics. There has been remarkable progress in the past several decades, through various different attempts. However, the decay character theory for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems remains largely open, as the Fourier transform of Green's function is generally not explicit in multi-dimensions. In this paper, we propose a general $L^p$ energy method and provide the positive answer to the unsolved question left in [5]. Under the convex entropy and Shizuta-Kawashima conditions, we pinpoint the critical regularity for the global solutions to the partially dissipative systems in the hybrid Besov spaces with different exponents on conservative and dissipative components in low and high frequencies, from the viewpoint of spectral analysis and the $L^1$ time integrability of Lipschitz bound. Furthermore, a new effective quantity $\Psi(t,x)$ capturing the interaction of conservative and dissipative components is introduced, which enables us to establish the sharp characterization of large-time asymptotic behavior. Finally, we also show that, with faster orders of convergence, the conservative and dissipative components of solutions can be asymptotically approximated by new profiles generated from parabolic systems subjected to $\Psi_0$ (the initial effective quantity), in the spirit of Chapman-Enskog expansion.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a finite-volume scheme for aggregation-diffusion equations with saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [Bailo, Carrillo, Hu. SIAM J. Appl. Math. 2023] the authors introduce a finite-volume method for aggregation-diffusion equations with non-linear mobility. In this paper we prove convergence of this method using an Aubin--Simons compactness theorem due to Gallou\"et and Latch\'e. We use suitable discrete $H^1$ and $W^{-1,1}$ discrete norms. We provide two convergence results. A first result shows convergence with general entropies ($U$) (including singular and degenerate) if the initial datum does not have free boundaries, the mobility is Lipschitz, and the confinement ($V$) and aggregation ($K$) potentials are $W^{2,\infty}_0$. A second result shows convergence when the initial datum has free boundaries, mobility is just continuous, and $V$ and $K$ are $W^{1,\infty}$, but under the assumption that the entropy $U$ is $C^1$ and strictly convex.</description>

      <title>Energy Balance and Optical Theorem for Time-Modulated Subwavelength Resonator Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wave propagation through a one-dimensional array of subwavelength resonators with periodically time-modulated material parameters. Focusing on a high-contrast regime, we use a scattering framework based on Fourier expansions and scattering matrix techniques to capture the interactions between an incident wave and the temporally varying system. This way, we derive a formulation of the total energy flux corresponding to time-dependent systems of resonators. We show that the total energy flux is composed of the transmitted and reflected energy fluxes, and derive an optical theorem which characterises the energy balance of the system. We provide a number of numerical experiments to investigate the impact of the time-dependency, the operating frequency and the number of resonators on the maximal attainable energy gain and energy loss. Moreover, we show the existence of lasing points, at which the total energy diverges. Our results lay the foundation for the design of energy dissipative or energy amplifying systems.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum Zero Problem of nonlinear Dirac equation with particle-antiparticle interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Spectrum Zero Problem of nonlinear Dirac equations with a focus on the behavior of zero at the boundaries of the spectral gap. We introduce a nonlinear particle-antiparticle interaction and demonstrate that the problem exhibits asymmetric behavior at the left and right boundaries of the spectrum. Specifically, when zero is at the right boundary, the problem has only trivial solutions and is identified as a bifurcation point on the left, whereas nontrivial solutions exist when zero is at the left boundary or within the spectral gap. The main idea is to employ a variational method involving a perturbation technique that places zero within the spectral gap. We use the critical point theorem of the perturbed functional to construct a Palais-Smale sequence in order to approach the critical point of the target energy functional. Additionally, we utilize the concentration-compactness principle to identify critical points of the original functional and explore the associated bifurcation phenomena. Our results reveal an asymmetric phenomenon in nonlinear quantum systems and provide insights into why strongly indefinite problems typically address zero only at the left boundary of the spectral gap.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of two layers of immiscible, inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational fluids through a full nonlinear system. Our goal is to establish a virial theorem and prove the polynomial growth of slope and curvature of the interface over time when the fluid below is no denser than the one above. These phenomena, known as Rayleigh-Taylor instability, will be proved for a broad class of regular initial data, including the case of 2D overlapping interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new existence result for abstract nonlinear operator systems in normed spaces, by means of topological methods. The solution is located within the product of annular regions and conical shells. The theoretical result possesses a wide range of applicability, which, for concreteness, we illustrate in the context of systems of nonlinear Poisson equations subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the latter problem we obtain existence and localization of solutions having all components nontrivial. This is also illustrated with an explicit example in which we also furnish a numerically approximated solution, consistent with the theoretical results. We conclude with an application of our results to a reaction--diffusion Lotka--Volterra system with source terms for competing species.</description>

      <title>Non-radiating elastic sources in inhomogeneous elastic media at corners with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with non-radiating elastic sources in inhomogeneous elastic media. We demonstrate that the value of non-radiating elastic sources must vanish at convex corners of their support, provided the sources exhibit H\"older continuous regularity near the corner. Additionally, their gradient must satisfy intricate algebraic relationships with the angles defining the underlying corners, assuming the sources have $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity with $\alpha\in (0,1)$ in the neighborhood of the corners. Our analysis employs complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions as test functions within a partial differential system to conduct asymptotic analysis near the corners. These characterizations enable us to establish unique identifiability results for determining the position and shape of radiating elastic sources from a single far-field measurement, both locally and globally. The uniqueness of such identification is a longstanding challenge in inverse scattering with a rich history. Specifically, when the support of a radiating elastic source is a convex polygon and the source is H\"older continuous at the corners, we can simultaneously determine the source's shape and its values at the corners. Furthermore, when the source function exhibits $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity in the neighborhood of a corner, the gradient at that corner can typically be determined. Additionally, when the support includes a convex sectorial corner and the elastic source satisfies certain generic conditions, we demonstrate that such a source must radiate at any frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the $2$-D semilinear wave equation with scale-invariant damping $\square u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$, where $t\geq 1$, $\mu&gt;0$ and $p&gt;1$, it is conjectured that the global small data weak solution $u$ exists when $p&gt;p_{s}(2+\mu) =\frac{\mu+3+\sqrt{\mu^2+14\mu+17}}{2(\mu+1)}$ for $0&lt;\mu\leq 2$ and $p&gt;p_f(2)=2$ for $\mu\geq 2$. In our previous papers, the global small solution $u$ has been obtained for $p&gt;p_{s}(2+\mu)$ and $0&lt;\mu&lt;2$ but $\mu\not=1$. In the present paper, by the vector field method together with the delicate analysis on the Bessel functions, we will show the global existence of small solution $u$ for $p&gt;2$ and $\mu&gt;2$. In forthcoming paper, for $\mu=1$ and $p&gt;p_{s}(2+\mu)=p_{s}(3)=1+\sqrt 2$, the global solution $u$ is also obtained. Therefore, collecting our series of conclusions together with partial results from others, this open question has been solved completely.</description>

      <title>A finite difference method with symmetry properties for the high-dimensional Bratu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the three-dimensional (3D) Bratu equation is highly challenging due to the presence of multiple and sharp solutions. Research on this equation began in the late 1990s, but there are no satisfactory results to date. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric finite difference method (SFDM) which embeds the symmetry properties of the solutions into a finite difference method (FDM). This SFDM is primarily used to obtain more accurate solutions and bifurcation diagrams for the 3D Bratu equation. Additionally, we propose modifying the Bratu equation by incorporating a new constraint that facilitates the construction of bifurcation diagrams and simplifies handling the turning points. The proposed method, combined with the use of sparse matrix representation, successfully solves the 3D Bratu equation on grids of up to $301^3$ points. The results demonstrate that SFDM outperforms all previously employed methods for the 3D Bratu equation. Furthermore, we provide bifurcation diagrams for the 1D, 2D, 4D, and 5D cases, and accurately identify the first turning points in all dimensions. All simulations indicate that the bifurcation diagrams of the Bratu equation on the cube domains closely resemble the well-established behavior on the ball domains described by Joseph and Lundgren [1]. Furthermore, when SFDM is applied to linear stability analysis, it yields the same largest real eigenvalue as the standard FDM despite having fewer equations and variables in the nonlinear system.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>
