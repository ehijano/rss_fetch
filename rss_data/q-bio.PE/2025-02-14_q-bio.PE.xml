      <title>Orthology and Near-Cographs in the Context of Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthologous genes, which arise through speciation, play a key role in comparative genomics and functional inference. In particular, graph-based methods allow for the inference of orthology estimates without prior knowledge of the underlying gene or species trees. This results in orthology graphs, where each vertex represents a gene, and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding genes are estimated to be orthologs. Orthology graphs inferred under a tree-like evolutionary model must be cographs. However, real-world data often deviate from this property, either due to noise in the data, errors in inference methods or, simply, because evolution follows a network-like rather than a tree-like process. The latter, in particular, raises the question of whether and how orthology graphs can be derived from or, equivalently, are explained by phylogenetic networks. Here, we study the constraints imposed on orthology graphs when the underlying evolutionary history follows a phylogenetic network instead of a tree. We show that any orthology graph can be represented by a sufficiently complex level-k network. However, such networks lack biologically meaningful constraints. In contrast, level-1 networks provide a simpler explanation, and we establish characterizations for level-1 explainable orthology graphs, i.e., those derived from level-1 evolutionary histories. To this end, we employ modular decomposition, a classical technique for studying graph structures. Specifically, an arbitrary graph is level-1 explainable if and only if each primitive subgraph is a near-cograph (a graph in which the removal of a single vertex results in a cograph). Additionally, we present a linear-time algorithm to recognize level-1 explainable orthology graphs and to construct a level-1 network that explains them, if such a network exists.</description>

      <title>Global Stabilization of Chemostats with Nonzero Mortality and Substrate Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In "chemostat"-type population models that incorporate substrate (nutrient) dynamics, the dependence of the birth (or growth) rate on the substrate concentration introduces nonlinear coupling that creates a challenge for stabilization that is global, namely, for all positive concentrations of the biomass and nutrients. This challenge for global stabilization has been overcome in the literature using relatively simple feedback when natural mortality of the biomass is absent. However, under natural mortality, it takes fortified, more complex feedback, outside of the existing nonlinear control design toolbox, to avoid biomass extinction from nutrient-depleted initial conditions. Such fortified feedback, the associated control Laypunov function design, and Lyapunov analysis of global stability are provided in this paper. We achieve global stabilization for two different chemostat models: (i) a lumped model, with two state variables, and (ii) a three-state model derived from an age-structured infinite-dimensional model. The proposed feedback stabilizers are explicit, applicable to both the lumped and the age-structured models, and coincide with simple feedback laws proposed in the literature when the mortality rate is zero. Global stabilization means subject to constraints: all positive biomass and nutrient concentrations are within the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium, and, additionally, this is achieved with a dilution input that is guaranteed to remain positive. For the lumped case with Haldane kinetics, we show that the reproduction rate dominating the mortality (excluding the reproduction and mortality being in balance) is not only sufficient but also necessary for global stabilization. The obtained results are illustrated with simple examples.</description>

      <title>Drivers of cooperation in social dilemmas on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding cooperation in social dilemmas requires models that capture the complexity of real-world interactions. While network frameworks have provided valuable insights to model the evolution of cooperation, they are unable to encode group interactions properly. Here, we introduce a general higher-order network framework for multi-player games on structured populations. Our model considers multi-dimensional strategies, based on the observation that social behaviours are affected by the size of the group interaction. We investigate dynamical and structural coupling between different orders of interactions, revealing the crucial role of nested multilevel interactions, and showing how such features can enhance cooperation beyond the limit of traditional models with uni-dimensional strategies. Our work identifies the key drivers promoting cooperative behaviour commonly observed in real-world group social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Extinction and Metastability of Pheromone-Roads in Stochastic Models for Foraging Walks of Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic changes of group behavior of eusocial insects are studied from the viewpoint of non-equilibrium phase transitions. Recent combined study of experiments and mathematical modeling by the group led by the third author suggests that a species of garden ant switches the individual foraging walk from pheromone-mediated to visual-cues-mediated depending on situation. If an initial pheromone-road between the nest and food sources is a detour, ants using visual cues can pioneer shorter paths. These shorter paths are reinforced by pheromone secreted by following ants, and then the detour ceases to exist. Once the old pheromone-road extincts, there will be almost no chance to reconstruct it. Hence the extinction of pheromone-road is expected to be regarded as a phase transition to an absorbing state. We propose a discrete-time model on a square lattice consisting of switching random walks interacting though time-dependent pheromone field. The numerical study shows that the critical phenomena of the present extinction transitions of pheromone-roads do not seem to belong to the directed percolation universality class associated with the usual absorbing-state transition. The new aspects are cased by the coexistence and competition with newly creating pheromone-roads. In a regime in the extinction phase, the annihilating road shows metastability and takes long time-period to be replaced by a new road.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Global Genomic Surveillance for Early Detection of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Global viral threats underscore the need for effective genomic surveillance, but high costs and uneven resource distribution hamper its implementation. Targeting surveillance to international travelers in major travel hubs may offer a more efficient strategy for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.
  Methods: We developed and calibrated a multiple-strain metapopulation model of global SARS-CoV-2 transmission using extensive epidemiological, phylogenetic, and high-resolution air travel data. We then compared baseline surveillance with various resource-allocation approaches that prioritize travelers, focusing on Omicron BA.1/BA.2 retrospectively and on hypothetical future variants under different emergence, transmission and vaccine effectiveness scenarios.
  Findings: Focusing existing surveillance resources on travelers at key global hubs significantly shortened detection delays without increasing total surveillance efforts. In retrospective analyses of Omicron BA.1/BA.2, traveler-targeted approaches consistently outperformed baseline strategies, even when overall resources were reduced. Simulations indicate that focusing surveillance on key travel hubs outperform baseline practices in detecting future variants, across different possible origins, even with reduced resources. This approach also remains effective in future pandemic scenarios with varying reproductive numbers and vaccine effectiveness.
  Interpretation: These findings provide a quantitative, cost-effective framework for strengthening global genomic surveillance. By reallocating resources toward international travelers in select travel hubs, early detection of emerging variants can be enhanced, informing rapid public health interventions and bolstering preparedness for future pandemics.</description>
