      <title>Quasiperiodic [110] Symmetric Tilt FCC Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate [110] symmetric tilt FCC grain boundaries (GBs) by a recently developed approach for quasiperiodic interfaces using the Landau-Brazovskii model. On special tilt angles associated with quadratic algebraic numbers, quasiperiodic GBs exhibit generalized Fibonacci substitution rules. The transition mechanism from quasiperiodic GBs to periodic GBs is explored through sphere offsets and spectral coalescence. We also propose an accurate method to calculate the GB energy for arbitrary tilt angle and analyze the factors affecting the GB energy. The revealing GB energy change is continue along with tilt angle except periodic GBs.</description>

      <title>A Low Duty Cycle Pulsed UV Technique for Spectroscopy of Aluminum Monochloride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to minimize UV-induced damage in experiments that employ second-harmonic generation cavities. The principle of our approach is to reduce the duty cycle of the UV light as much as possible to prolong the lifetime of the used optics. The low duty cycle is achieved by ramping the cavity into resonance for a short time during the experimental cycle when the light is used and tuning it to an off-resonant state otherwise. The necessary fast ramp and length-stabilization control of the cavity is implemented with the FPGA-based STEMlab platform. We demonstrate the utility of this method by measuring the isotope shift of the electronic transition ($X^1\Sigma \leftarrow A^1\Pi$) in AlCl at 261.5 nm in a pulsed molecular beam experiment.</description>

      <title>A self-aligning recirculated crossed optical dipole trap for lithium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossed optical dipole traps (ODTs) provide three-dimensional confinement of cold atoms and other optically trappable particles. However, the need to maintain the intersection of the two trapping beams poses strict requirements on alignment stability, and limits the ability to move the trap. Here we demonstrate a novel crossed ODT design that features inherent stability of the beam crossing, allowing the trap to move and remain aligned. The trap consists of a single high-power laser beam, imaged back onto itself at an angle to form a crossed trap. Self-aligning behavior results from employing an imaging system with positive magnification tuned precisely to unity. We employ laser-cooled samples of $^6$Li atoms to demonstrate that the trap remains well-aligned over a 4.3 mm travel range along an axis approximately perpendicular to the plane containing the crossed beams. Our scheme can be applied to bring an atomic cloud held in a crossed ODT close to a surface or field source for various applications in quantum simulation, sensing, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Dark state transport between unitary Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of dark states is an important concept in quantum sciences, but its compatibility with strong interparticle interactions, for example, in a quantum degenerate gas is hardly explored. Here, we realize a dark state in one of the spins of a two-component, resonantly-interacting Fermi gas using a $\Lambda$ system within the $D_2$ transitions of $^6$Li at high magnetic field. The dark state is created in a micrometer-sized region within a one-dimensional channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs. The particle transport between the reservoirs is used as a probe. We observe that atoms are transported in the dark state and the superfluid-assisted fast current is preserved. If the dark state resonant condition is not met, the transport is suppressed by the spontaneous emission. We also uncover an asymmetry in the transport timescale across the two-photon resonance, which is absent in the non-interacting regime. This work raises questions on the interplay of dark states with interparticle interactions and opens up perspectives for optical manipulation of fermionic pairing.</description>

      <title>Input of the Coulomb law modification to the Lamb shift of the hydrogen atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections which remove accidental degeneracy in the spectrum of the relativistic hydrogen atom and lead to the modification of the Coulomb law, are calculated within the novel approach, based on the exact solution of the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential. The energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom is obtained with account of these corrections and the Lamb shift is calculated for the lowest energy states.</description>

      <title>Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, which allows us to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as a general tool to probe and identify many-body states of bilayer quantum gases.</description>
