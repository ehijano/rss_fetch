      <title>Defect liquids in a weakly imbalanced bilayer Wigner Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a density-imbalanced bilayer Wigner crystal, where the ratio of electron densities in separate layers deviates slightly from unity, defects spontaneously form in one or both layers in the ground state of the system. Due to quantum tunneling, these defects become mobile and the system becomes a defect liquid. Motivated by this idea, we numerically study the semiclassical energetics of individual and paired point defects in the bilayer Wigner crystal system. We use these results in combination with a simple defect model to map the phase diagram of the defect liquid as a function of electron density and interlayer distance. Our results should be relevant for present experimental bilayer Wigner crystal systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Materials with Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum materials -- solids in which quantum-mechanical interactions among constituent electrons yield a great variety of novel emergent phenomena -- is a forefront challenge in modern condensed matter physics. This goal has driven the invention and refinement of several experimental methods, which can spectroscopically determine the elementary excitations and correlation functions that determine material properties. This Perspectives article focuses on the future experimental and theoretical trends of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), which is a remarkably versatile and rapidly growing technique for probing different charge, lattice, spin, and orbital excitations in quantum materials. We provide a forward-looking introduction to RIXS and outline how this technique is poised to deepen our insight into the nature of quantum materials and their emergent electronic phenomena.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of the electronic structure, Z2 invariant and quantum oscillation in the kagome material CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed study of the electronic structure, phonon dispersion, Z2 invariant calculation, and Fermi surface of the newly discovered kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, using density functional theory (DFT). The phonon dispersion in the pristine state reveals two negative modes at the M and L points of the Brillouin zone, indicating lattice instability. CsV3Sb5 transitions into a structurally stable 2x2x1 charge density wave (CDW) phase, confirmed by positive phonon modes. The electronic band structure shows several Dirac points near the Fermi level, with a narrow gap opening due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), though the effect of SOC on other bands is minimal. In the pristine phase, this material exhibits a quasi-2D cylindrical Fermi surface, which undergoes reconstruction in the CDW phase. We calculated quantum oscillation frequencies using Onsager's relation, finding good agreement with experimental results in the CDW phase. To explore the topological properties of CsV3Sb5, we computed the Z2 invariant in both pristine and CDW phases, resulting in a value of (u0; u1u2u3) = (1; 000), suggesting the strong topological nature of this material. Our detailed analysis of phonon dispersion, electronic bands, Fermi surface mapping, and Z2 invariant provides insights into the topological properties, CDW order, and unconventional superconductivity in AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs).</description>

      <title>Effects of frequency mixing on Shapiro-step formations in sliding charge-density-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) is driven to slide by a dc electric field, carrying an electric current. In an additional ac field with frequency ${\omega}_{\mathrm{ex}}$, it is known that the sliding CDW can be synchronized to $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$, leading to the occurrence of Shapiro steps in the $I$-$V$ characteristics. Motivated by a recent experiment where ac fields with two frequencies $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}^{\prime}$ are simultaneously applied, we theoretically investigate the effects of frequency mixing on the Shapiro-step formation. Based on the Fukuyama-Lee-Rice model, we show that in addition to the main steps induced by $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$, satellite steps characterized by $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}^{\prime}$ emerge. It is also found that with increasing the ac-field strength for $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}^{\prime}$, each step width first exhibits a damped oscillation as in the one-frequency case, and then, exhibits a non-monotonic behavior. The origin of these behaviors and the relevance to the associated experiment are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergent spacetime supersymmetry in an interacting Kitaev chain with explicit supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in an interacting Kitaev chain model with explicit microscopic $\mathcal{N}=1$ quantum mechanical SUSY. As the interaction strength is varied, the model transitions from a weak-coupling gapless phase with spontaneously broken SUSY to a strong-coupling phase with restored SUSY. In this paper, we numerically determine the transition point and investigate the phase structure around it. The weak-coupling phase is governed by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1/2$ which agrees with the prediction made in our previous work and that the SUSY restoration transition which borders the strong-coupling gapped phase belongs to the $c=7/10$ tricritical Ising universality with emergent superconformal invariance. Crucially, the phase structure around the transition closely aligns with the scenario proposed by Zamolodchikov and others based on the integrable deformation of CFTs. These findings provide a concrete example of a lattice model where explicit microscopic supersymmetry at criticality, enriches the understanding of phase transitions governed by supersymmetric conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation in the Putative Fractional Quantum Hall A phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use several techniques to probe the wave functions proposed to describe the ${\cal A}$ phases by Das, Das, and Mandal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 056202 (2023); Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 106501 (2024); Phys. Rev. B 110, L121303 (2024).]. As opposed to representing fractional quantum Hall liquids, we find these wave functions to describe states that clearly display strong phase separation. In the process of exploring these wave functions, we have also constructed several new methods for diagnosing phase separation and generating such wave functions numerically. Finally, we uncover a new property of entanglement spectra that can be used as a check for the accuracy of numerics.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamic Electronic Properties of Weyl Semimetal NbP -- A Single Crystal $^{93}$Nb-NMR Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have been used to study the static and dynamic microscopic properties of the Weyl semimetal NbP. From a complete analysis of the angular dependence of the $^{93}$Nb-NMR spectra in a single crystal, the parameters for the electric quadrupole interactions and the magnetic hyperfine interactions were determined to be $\nu_{\rm Q} = 0.61$\,MHz, $\eta = 0.20$, $(K_{XX}, K_{YY}, K_{ZZ}) = (- 0.06, 0.11, - 0.11)$\% at 4.5\,K. The temperature and field dependence of the $^{93}$Nb Knight shift revealed a characteristic feature of the shape of the density of states with nearly massless fermions. We clearly observed a quantum oscillation of the Knight shift associated with the band structure, whose frequency was in good agreement with the previous bulk measurements. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1 / T_{1} T$, showed an almost constant behavior for $30 &lt; T &lt; 180$\,K, while a weak temperature dependence was observed below $\sim 30$\,K. This contrasts with the behavior observed in TaP and TaAs, where the $1 / T_{1} T$ measured by the $^{181}$Ta nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) shows $1 / T_{1} T \propto T^{2}$ and $T^{4}$ above approximately 30\,K. In TaP, the temperature dependent orbital hyperfine interaction plays a signficant role in nuclear relaxation, whereas this contribution is not observed in TaAs. Two-component spin echo oscillations were observed. The shorter-period oscillation is attributed to the origin of quadrupole coupling, while the longer-period oscillation indicates the presence of indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling, as discussed in other Weyl semimetal like TaP.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlations and nonequilibrium sum rules in photodoped Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using matrix product state techniques we study the nonequilibrium dynamical response of the half-filled Hubbard ladder when subject to an optical pump. Optical pumping offers a way of producing and manipulating new strongly correlated phenomena by suppressing existing magnetic correlations. The ladder allows the effects of pump directionality to be investigated, and compared to a single chain it has strong spin-charge coupling and a fully gapped excitation spectrum, promising different nonequilibrium physics. We compute time-dependent correlations, including the nonequilibrium dynamical structure factors for spin and charge. By deriving a combined spin-charge sum rule that applies both in and out-of-equilibrium, we show that spectral weight is pumped directly from the antiferromagnetic spin response into a low energy $\omega\sim 0$ charge response below the Mott gap. The transfer of weight is pump direction dependent: pumping directed along the legs disrupts magnetic correlations more than pumping in the rung direction, even if the post pump energy density is similar. The charge correlation length is dramatically enhanced by the pump, whilst the spin correlations are most strongly suppressed at nearest and next-nearest neighbour spacings. After the pump the system is in a nonthermal correlated metallic state, with gapless charge excitations and approximately equal spin and charge correlation lengths, emphasising the importance of treating these degrees of freedom on an equal footing in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the dimerized diamond lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a combination of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and a decoupled dimer mean-field theory, we investigate the thermal and quantum phase transitions of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the dimerized diamond lattice. We find that at sufficiently strong dimerization the system exhibits a quantum disordered ground state, in contrast to the antiferromagnetic phase stabilized at weak dimerization. We determine the quantum critical point and examine the thermodynamic responses in both regimes. The ratio for the critical interdimer ($J_c$) to intradimer ($J_D$) coupling is obtained as $J_c/J_D = 0.3615(5)$. Our results show that the decoupled dimer mean-field theory well captures the competition between the local singlet formation and the antiferromagnetic ordering tendency, and thus provides an appropriate qualitative description of this three-dimensional quantum magnet, in contrast to the conventional mean-field decoupling. We also examine the differences in the ordering temperatures between the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the diamond lattice based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Electronic Raman scattering of antiferromagnetic excitonic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitonic insulator, a quantum mechanical state arising from exciton condensation, was proposed theoretically many years ago but has yet to be experimentally confirmed. The discovery of correlated transition metal oxides based on $4d$ and $5d$ elements, where the on-site Coulomb repulsion is comparable to the dominant hopping amplitude, presents a unique opportunity to study exciton condensation. By constructing an effective mean field Raman operator for the Hubbard model, we derive the low-energy electronic Raman scattering cross section, demonstrating Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool for detecting exciton condensation. Here, we demonstrate that Raman scattering directly reveals exciton condensation in the bilayer iridate Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ under pressure.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking meets average symmetry-protected topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have unveiled new possibilities for discovering intrinsic quantum phases that are unique to open systems, including phases with average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) order and strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) order in systems with global symmetry. In this work, we propose a new class of phases, termed the double ASPT phase, which emerges from a nontrivial extension of these two orders. This new phase is absent from prior studies and cannot exist in conventional closed systems. Using the recently developed imaginary-Lindbladian formalism, we explore the phase diagram of a one-dimensional open system with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. We identify universal critical behaviors along each critical line and observe the emergence of an intermediate phase that completely breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}$ symmetry, leading to the formation of two triple points in the phase diagram. These two triple points are topologically distinct and connected by a domain-wall decoration duality map. Our results promote the establishment of a complete classification for quantum phases in open systems with various symmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Study of Critical Fermi Surface with Spatial Disorder Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids are an important topic in condensed matter physics, as their characteristics challenge the framework of traditional Fermi liquid theory and reveal the complex behavior of electrons in strongly interacting systems. Despite some progress in this field, linear-in-temperature resistance and inverse-in-frequency tail of optical conductivity are unresolved issues in non-Fermi liquids. Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistance.</description>

      <title>Instability of steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.</description>

      <title>Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$, where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a local superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We present how this scenario can fit most of the available data and propose additional experimental tests which can distinguish our proposal from the Meissner flux exclusion scenario. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. More broadly, this work provides a new mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales.</description>

      <title>Evolution of pairing symmetry in {\FSS} as probed by uniaxial-strain tuning of $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), the interplay between electronic nematicity and superconductivity is essential for understanding the exotic superconducting ground state. In the nematic regime, uniaxial-strain ($\varepsilon$) tuning of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ [$\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)=\alpha\varepsilon+\beta\varepsilon^2$] offers a unique approach to investigating the evolution of pairing symmetry if both $s$ and $d$ wave pairing instabilities are relevant. Here, we employ uniaxial strain to tune the $T_c$ of {\FSS}, in which both nematicity and superconductivity undergo significant changes with doping. While $T_c$ is usually suppressed quadratically with $\varepsilon$ in optimally doped {\BFA}, $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)$ in {\FSS} dominated by $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)=\beta\varepsilon^2$ changes its sign from $\beta$ &lt; $0$ in FeSe to $\beta$ &gt; $0$ in {\FSS} ($x\gtrsim0.10$), indicating an evolution of the pairing symmetry from an $s_{\pm}$ state towards an $s+d$ wave state. These findings highlight the $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)$ as a powerful probe for elucidating the superconducting pairing symmetry in the nematic regime of FeSCs and provide new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry in FeSCs.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Digital Image Correlation as a Probe of Strain in Iron-Based Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniaxial strain is a powerful tuning parameter that can control symmetry and anisotropic electronic properties in iron-based superconductors. However, accurately characterizing anisotropic strain can be challenging and complex. Here, we utilize a cryogenic optical system equipped with a high-spatial-resolution microscope to characterize surface strains in iron-based superconductors using the digital image correlation method. Compared with other methods such as high-resolution X-ray diffraction, strain gauge, and capacitive sensor, digital image correlation offers a non-contact, full-field measurement approach, acting as an optical virtual strain gauge that provides high spatial resolution. The results measured on detwinned {\BFA} are quantitatively consistent with the distortion measured by X-ray diffraction and neutron Larmor diffraction. These findings highlight the potential of cryogenic digital image correlation as an effective and accessible tool for probing the isotropic and anisotropic strains, facilitating the application of uniaxial strain tuning in the study of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Holographic Non-Hermitian Lattices and Junctions with PT-Restoring RG Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogenoeus non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. Depending on whether we turn on a complex external gauge field, we find solutions that spontaneously break PT (thus hinting at a lack of unitary evolution) and solutions that do not. The former present an imaginary current responsible for the spontaneous breaking of PT. We also study the IR geometry of these solutions finding that they flow to a PT-unbroken fixed point. This leads us to claim that there is a PT-symmetry restoration in the IR, similar to the one observed in the perturbative setup of arXiv:2110.05289.</description>

      <title>Terahertz resonant emission by optically excited infrared-active shear phonons in KY(MoO4)2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of the monochromatic electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz (THz) range of frequencies for many decades remanes a chellenging task. Here we demonstrate the emission of monochromatic sub-THz radiation by coherent optical phonons in dielectric material KY(MoO4)2. The layered crystal structure of KY(MoO4)2 leads to infrared-active shear lattice vibrations with energies below 3.7 meV, which corresponds to the frequencies low than 900 GHz where solid-state compounds based monochromatic radiation sources are rare. Coherent infrared-active optical phonons are excited by broadband THz pulses lasting for tens of picoseconds and re-emit narrow-band subTHz radiation pulses with a decay time of 33 picoseconds, which is exceptionally long for the oscillators with frequencies below 1 THz. Such a long coherent emission allows for the detection of more than 50 periods of radiation with frequencies of 568 and 860 GHz. The remarkably long decay time together with the chemical stability of the employed materials suggest a variety of possible applications in THz laser technology.</description>

      <title>Post-measurement Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our `post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a long-ranged charge order with 1/4 Ge1-dimerization in an antiferromagnetic Kagome metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exotic quantum states arise from the interplay of various degrees of freedom such as charge, spin, orbital, and lattice. Recently, a novel short-ranged charge order (CO) was discovered deep inside the antiferromagnetic phase of Kagome magnet FeGe, exhibiting close relationships with magnetism. Despite extensive investigations, the CO mechanism remains controversial, mainly because the short-ranged behavior hinders precise identification of CO superstructure. Here, combining multiple experimental techniques, we report the observation of a long-ranged CO in high-quality FeGe samples, which is accompanied with a first-order structural transition. With these high-quality samples, the distorted 2 * 2 * 2 CO superstructure is characterized by a strong dimerization along the c-axis of 1/4 of Ge1-sites in Fe3Ge layers, and in response to that, the 2 * 2 in-plane charge modulations are induced. Moreover, we show that the previously reported short-ranged CO might be related to large occupational disorders at Ge1-site, which upsets the equilibrium of the CO state and the ideal 1 * 1 * 1 structure with very close energies, inducing nanoscale coexistence of these two phases.Our study provides crucial clues for further understanding the CO properties in FeGe and helps to identify the CO mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast light-matter interaction to manipulate electronic states of quantum materials is an emerging area of research in condensed matter physics. It has significant implications for the development of future ultrafast electronic devices. However, the ability to induce long-lasting metastable electronic states in a fully reversible manner is a long-standing challenge.Here, by using ultrafast laser excitations, we demonstrate the capability to manipulate the electronic polar states in the charge-density-wavematerial EuTe4 in a non-volatile manner. The process is completely reversible and is achieved at room temperature with an all-optical approach. Each induced non-volatile state brings about modifications to the electrical resistance and second harmonic generation intensity. The results point to layer-specific phase inversion dynamics by which photoexcitation mediates the stacking polar order of the system. Our findings extend the scope of non-volatile all-optical control of electronic states to ambient conditions, and highlight a distinct role of layerdependent phase manipulation in quasi-two-dimensional systems with inherent sublayer stacking orders.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytically solvable model for correlated electrons, which is able to capture the major Fermi surface modifications occurring in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates as a function of doping. The proposed Hamiltonian qualitatively reproduces the results of numerically demanding many-body calculations, here obtained using the dynamical vertex approximation. Our analytical theory provides a transparent description of a precise mechanism, capable to drive the formation of disconnected segments along the Fermi surface (the highly debated "Fermi arcs") as well as of the opening of a pseudogap at hole- and electron-doping. This occurs through a specific mechanism: The electronic states on the Fermi arcs remain intact, while the Fermi surface part where the gap opens transforms into a Luttinger arc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong correlations occur in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) when the octet of flat moir\'e minibands centered on charge neutrality (CN) is partially occupied. The octet consists of a single valence band and a single conduction band for each of four degenerate spin-valley flavors. Motivated by the importance of Hartree electrostatic interactions in determining the filling-factor dependent band structure, we use a time-dependent Hartree approximation to gain insight into electronic correlations. We find that the electronic compressibility is dominated by Hartree interactions, that paramagnetic states are stable over a range of density near CN, and that the dependence of energy on flavor polarization is strongly overestimated by mean-field theory.</description>

Abstract: The problem of a local impurity in a Luttinger liquid, just like the anisotropic Kondo problem (of which it is technically a cousin), describes many different physical systems. As shown by Kane and Fisher, the presence of interactions profoundly modifies the physics familiar from Fermi liquid theory, and leads to non-intuitive features, best described in the Renormalization Group language (RG), such as flows towards healed or split fixed points. While this problem has been studied for many years using more traditional condensed matter approaches, it remains somewhat mysterious from the point of view of entanglement, both for technical and conceptual reasons. We propose and explore in this paper a new way to think of this important aspect. We use the realization of the Kane Fisher universality class provided by an XXZ spin chain with a modified bond strength between two sites and explore the difference of (Von Neumann) entanglement entropies of a region of length $\ell$ with the rest of the system - to which it relates to a modified bond - in the cases when $\ell$ is even and odd. Surprisingly, we find out that this difference $\delta S\equiv S^e-S^o$ remains of $O(1)$ in the thermodynamic limit, and gives rise now, depending on the sign of the interactions, to "resonance" curves, interpolating between $-\ln 2$ and $0$, and depending on the product $\ell T_B$, where $1/T_B$ is a characteristic length scale akin to the Kondo length in Kondo problems. $\delta S$ can be interpreted as a measure of the hybridization of the left-over spin in odd length subsystems with the "bath" constituted by the rest of the chain. The problem is studied both numerically using DMRG and analytically near the healed and split fixed points. Interestingly - and in contrast with what happens in other impurity problems - $\delta S$ can, at least to lowest order, be tackled by conformal perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) candidate arising from Moir\'e bands with higher Chern number C=2 on a magic angle twisted bilayer checkboard lattice (MATBCB). There are two nearly flat low lying bands in the single particle energy spectrum under the first magic angle $\phi\approx 1.608^{\circ}$ and chiral limit. We find MATBCB hosts a nearly uniform Berry curvature distribution and exhibits tiny violation of quantum geometric trace condition in the first moir\'e Brillourin Zone (mBZ), indicating that there is a nearly ideal quantum geometry in MATBCB in single particle level. Turning on projected Coulomb interactions, we perform exact diagonalization and find a ten-fold ground state quasi-degeneracy in many body energy spectrum with filling fraction $\nu=1/5$. The ten-fold quasi-degenrate ground states further show spectra flow under flux pumping. By diagnosing the particle entanglement spectrum (PES) of the ground states, we obtain a clear PES gap and quasi-hole state counting consistent with Halperin spin singlet generalized Pauli principle, suggesting that a fractional Chern insulator is realized in this system.</description>

Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (PLG) has attracted significant attention due to its potential for observing exotic quantum states. In this work, we present a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory for the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG. In particular, we focus on the convergence of the Hartree-Fock calculation with various reference fields and discuss the stability of the FQAH states in PLG. We show that the so-called charge neutrality scheme provides an unambiguous result for the Hartree-Fock calculation, as it ensures a convergence with respect to the momentum cutoff. Based on the Hartree-Fock band structure, we further carry out exact diagonalization calculations to explore the stability of the FQAH states in PLG. Our work provides an improved and unified (minimal) theoretical framework to understand the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG and paves the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Existence of Hebel-Slichter peak in unconventional kagome superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical investigation of the spin susceptibility of unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice. Despite the existence of a sign-changing gap structure, which sums to zero over the Fermi surface, we show that such unconventional pairing states may exhibit a Hebel-Slichter peak in the temperature-dependent spin-lattice relaxation rate. It originates from destructive sublattice interference effects. For the same reason, unconventional pairing states on the kagome lattice tend not to exhibit a neutron resonance peak. These results supplement previous theoretical studies of the surprising robustness of sign-changing gap structures to disorder on the kagome lattice. Taken together these findings imply that unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice is deceptive in the sense that its properties may appear similar to conventional non-sign-changing superconductivity. These results may be of relevance to the superconducting state of the kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$: K, Rb, Cs) and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$.</description>

In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <title>Impact of potential and temperature fluctuations on charge and heat transport in quantum Hall edges in the heat Coulomb blockade regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a broad study of charge and heat transport in a mesoscopic system where one or several quantum Hall edge channels are strongly coupled to a floating Ohmic contact (OC). It is well known that charge-current fluctuations emanating from the OC along the edge channels are highly susceptible to the OC charge capacitance in the heat Coulomb blockade regime (an impeded ability of the OC to equilibrate edge channels). Here, we demonstrate how potential- and temperature fluctuations due to finite OC charge and heat capacities impact the heat-current fluctuations emitted from the OC. First, by assuming an infinite OC heat capacity, we show that the output heat-current noise is strongly dependent on the OC charge capacitance, following from a close relation between one-dimensional charge- and heat currents. When also the OC heat capacity is finite, an interplay of potential- and temperature fluctuations influences the heat transport. Concretely, we find that the effect of the charge capacitance on heat transport manifests in terms of a strongly increased energy relaxation time in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. Furthermore, we find expressions for a broad set of output observables, such as charge and heat auto- and cross correlations, as functions of input and OC fluctuations, depending on the relation between charge and energy relaxation times compared to the frequency of fluctuations and inverse (local) temperatures as well as on the number of edge channels attached to the OC. Finally, we show that a finite OC heat capacity transforms the full counting statistics of the output charge from Gaussian to non-Gaussian. Our findings provide novel opportunities to experimentally probe and harness the quantum nature of heat transport in strongly coupled electron circuits.</description>

      <title>Reflection and Transmission Amplitudes in a Digital Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus by the Field-Induced Partitioning of Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To search for a conceptual picture describing the magnetization plateau phenomenon, we surveyed the crystal structures and the spin lattices of those magnets exhibiting plateaus in their magnetization vs. magnetic field curves by probing the three questions: (a) why only certain magnets exhibit magnetization plateaus, (b) why there occur several different types of magnetization plateaus, and (c) what controls the widths of magnetization plateaus. We show that the answers to these questions lie in how the magnets under field absorb Zeeman energy hence changing their magnetic structures. The magnetic structure of a magnet insulator is commonly described in terms of its spin lattice, which requires the determination of the spin exchanges nonnegligible strengths between the magnetic ions. Our work strongly suggests that a magnet under magnetic field partitions its spin lattice into antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic fragments by breaking its weak magnetic bonds. Our supposition of the field-induced partitioning of spin lattice into magnetic fragments is supported by the anisotropic magnetization plateaus of Ising magnets and by the highly anisotropic width of the 1/3-magnetization plateau in azurite. The answers to the three questions (a) - (c) emerge naturally by analyzing how these fragments are formed under magnetic field.</description>
