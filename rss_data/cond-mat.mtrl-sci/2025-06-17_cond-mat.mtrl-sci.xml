      <title>\beta-Ga2O3-Based Heterojunctions: Exploring Growth Orientations and Alloying Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of alloying and growth orientation on the properties of the ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor \beta-Ga2O3 and pseudomorphic AlGaO alloy heterojunctions. Band offsets are computed from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) with the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional for different Al concentrations and four growth orientations, namely (100)B, (010), (001)B, and ($\bar{2}$01). Significant variations are found and ascribed to the strained pseudomorphic alloys. The values of the band offsets are fed into technology computer-aided design (TCAD) models of Schottky barrier diodes (SBD). I-V and C-V characteristics from the TCAD models show reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements in the forward bias region. Discrepancies in the negative bias region are expected due to the ideality of the Schottky junctions considered in this study. Our findings underscore the importance of growth orientation and strain in modelling of \beta-Ga2O3-based SBD.</description>

      <title>Approximate Excited-State Potential Energy Surfaces for Defects in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A description of electron-phonon coupling at a defect or impurity is essential to characterizing and harnessing its functionality for a particular application. Electron-phonon coupling limits the amount of useful light produced by a single-photon emitter and can destroy the efficiency of optoelectronic devices by enabling defects to act as recombination centers. Information on atomic relaxations in the excited state of the center is needed to assess electron-phonon coupling but may be inaccessible due to failed convergence or computational expense. Here we develop an approximation technique to quantify electron-phonon coupling using only the forces of the excited state evaluated in the equilibrium geometry of the ground state. The approximations are benchmarked on well-studied defect systems, namely C$_{\rm N}$ in GaN, the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, and the carbon dimer in h-BN. We demonstrate that the zero-phonon line energy can be approximated with just a single mode, while the Huang-Rhys factor converges by including displacements up to the second nearest neighbors. This work also provides important insight into the success of the widely utilized one-dimensional accepting-mode approximation, specifically demonstrating that the accepting-mode Huang-Rhys factor is a strict upper bound on the full multidimensional Huang-Rhys factor.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Amorphous Defect Phases Measured Through Ultrafast Nanocalorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognition of the role of extended defects on local phase transitions has led to the conceptualization of the defect phase, localized thermodynamically stable interfacial states that have since been applied in a myriad of material systems to realize significant enhancements in material properties. Here, we explore the kinetics of grain boundary confined amorphous defect phases, utilizing the high temperature and scanning rates afforded by ultrafast differential scanning calorimetry to apply targeted annealing/quenching treatments at high rates capable of capturing the kinetic behavior. Four Al-based nanocrystalline alloys, including two binary systems, Al-Ni and Al-Y, and two ternary systems, Al-Mg-Y and Al-Ni-Y, are selected to probe the materials design space (enthalpy of mixing, enthalpy of segregation, chemical complexity) for amorphous defect phase formation and stability, with correlative transmission electron microscopy applied to link phase evolution and grain stability to nanocalorimetry signatures. A series of targeted isothermal annealing heat treatments is utilized to construct a Time-Temperature-Transformation curve for the Al-Ni system, from which a critical cooling rate of 2,400 {\deg}C/s was determined for the grain boundary confined disordered-to-ordered transition. Finally, a thermal profile consisting of 1,000 repeated annealing sequences was created to explore the recovery of the amorphous defect phase following sequential annealing treatments, with results indicating remarkable microstructural stability after annealing at temperatures above 90% of the melting temperature. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of grain boundary localized thermodynamics and kinetics, with potential implications for the design and optimization of advanced materials with enhanced stability and performance.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals and Advances in Transverse Thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role to discuss their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.</description>

      <title>Extracting Composition-Dependent Diffusion Coefficients Over a Very Large Composition Range in NiCoFeCrMn High Entropy Alloy Following Strategic Design of Diffusion Couples and Physics Informed Neural Network Numerical Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating composition dependent diffusion coefficients in multicomponent alloys was a longstanding challenge due to limitations in experimental methods. In this study, we have first demonstrated a strategic design of producing only three diffusion couples to estimate all types, that is tracer, intrinsic, and interdiffusion coefficients at the Kirkendall marker planes. This establishes a systematic variation of diffusion coefficients with composition in a very wide composition range of the NiCoFeCrMn system in comparison to the data available on impurity diffusion coefficients in pure elements and tracer diffusion coefficients at the equiatomic composition estimated by the radiotracer method. Following, a physics-informed Neural Network based numerical inverse method is developed to extract composition-dependent diffusivities over the whole composition range of the diffusion couples.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen response to high-density dislocations in bulk perovskite oxide SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen plays an increasingly important role in green energy technologies. For instance, proton-conducting oxides with high performance for fuel cell components or electrolysers need to be developed. However, this requires a fundamental understanding of hydrogen-defects interactions. While point defects and grain boundaries in oxides have been extensively studied, the role of dislocations as line defects remains less understood, primarily due to the challenge for effective dislocation engineering in brittle oxides. In this work, we demonstrate the impact of dislocations in bulk single-crystal perovskite oxide SrTiO3 on hydrogen uptake and diffusion using deuterium as tracer. Dislocations with a high density up to ~10 to the power of 14 per square meter were mechanically introduced at room temperature. Exposing this dislocation-rich and the reference regions (with a dislocation density of ~10 to the power of 10 per square meter) to deuterium at 400 {\deg}C for 1h, followed by secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements, we observed a ~100 times increase in deuterium incorporation in the dislocation-rich region. The result suggests that dislocations in oxides can act as an effective reservoir for deuterium. This proof-of-concept brings new insights into the emerging hydrogen-dislocation interactions in functional oxides.</description>

      <title>Impact of in-plane disorders on the thermal conductivity of AgCrSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superionic conductors have recently attracted renewed attention for their use as thermoelectric materials due to their extremely low lattice thermal conductivity. Of central interest is why the superionic conductors exhibit such low thermal conductivity, and competing mechanisms have been proposed thus far. In this study, we investigate the effects of Cu and Au substitution for Ag site on the crystal structure and thermal properties of AgCrSe$_2$, which exhibits superionic conduction of Ag ions. We show that Au substitution significantly reduces the lattice thermal conductivity of AgCrSe$_2$. Powder structure analysis using synchrotron x-ray diffraction reveals that Au substitution increases the anisotropic atomic displacement parameter of Ag ions along the $a$ and $b$ axes. This result indicates that the amplitude of in-plane vibrations is enhanced, which is attributed to increased anharmonicity in the potential energy around Ag ions. The enhanced vibrational amplitude also suggests a reduction in the force constants between Ag ions. Consequently, the enhanced anharmonicity not only shortens the phonon lifetime ($\tau$) by increasing phonon-phonon scattering, but also increases the number of low-energy phonons, which further contributes to the reduction of $\tau$. This anharmonicity mechanism is applicable to other superionic conductors exhibiting ultra-low thermal conductivity, promoting their widespread use as thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial stress tuning of interfacial thermal conductance in cubic BAs/4H-SiC heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interfacial thermal transport is essential for improving thermal management in high-speed power electronic devices, where the efficient removal of excess heat is a critical challenge. In this study, a machine learning interatomic potential with near first-principles accuracy was employed to investigate the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) between [111]-oriented cubic boron arsenide (cBAs) and [0001]-oriented 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC), as well as its dependence on uniaxial stress. Among all possible bonding configurations at the cBAs(111)/4H-SiC(0001) interface, the B-C bonded interface was identified as the most energetically favorable. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations revealed that, under ambient conditions (300 K and 0 GPa), the ITC of the B-C interface reaches 353 $\pm$ 6 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, and increases monotonically to 460 $\pm$ 3 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ under a uniaxial stress of 25 GPa perpendicular to the interface. For comparison, the As-C bonded interface exhibits a lower ITC, increasing from 233 $\pm$ 7 to 318 $\pm$ 6 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ over the same stress range. These results demonstrate that proper interfacial bonding and moderate uniaxial stress can significantly enhance thermal transport across the cBAs(111)/4H-SiC(0001) heterointerface, offering valuable insight for thermal design in next-generation power electronics.</description>

      <title>Information fusion strategy integrating pre-trained language model and contrastive learning for materials knowledge mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized materials design, yet predicting complex properties like alloy ductility remains challenging due to the influence of processing conditions and microstructural features that resist quantification through traditional reductionist approaches. Here, we present an innovative information fusion architecture that integrates domain-specific texts from materials science literature with quantitative physical descriptors to overcome these limitations. Our framework employs MatSciBERT for advanced textual comprehension and incorporates contrastive learning to automatically extract implicit knowledge regarding processing parameters and microstructural characteristics. Through rigorous ablation studies and comparative experiments, the model demonstrates superior performance, achieving coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.849 and 0.680 on titanium alloy validation set and refractory multi-principal-element alloy test set. This systematic approach provides a holistic framework for property prediction in complex material systems where quantitative descriptors are incomplete and establishes a foundation for knowledge-guided materials design and informatics-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Tailored ordering enables high-capacity cathode materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newly designed Li-ion battery cathode materials with high capacity and greater flexibility in chemical composition will be critical for the growing electric vehicles market. Cathode structures with cation disorder were once considered suboptimal, but recent demonstrations have highlighted their potential in Li$_{1+x}$M$_{1-x}$O$_{2}$ chemistries with a wide range of metal combinations M. By relaxing the strict requirements of maintaining ordered Li diffusion pathways, countless multi-metal compositions in LiMO$_2$ may become viable, aiding the quest for high-capacity cobalt-free cathodes. A challenge presented by this freedom in composition space is designing compositions which possess specific, tailored types of both long- and short-range orderings, which can ensure both phase stability and Li diffusion. However, the combinatorial complexity associated with local cation environments impedes the development of general design guidelines for favorable orderings. Here we propose ordering design frameworks from computational ordering descriptors, which in tandem with low-cost heuristics and elemental statistics can be used to simultaneously achieve compositions that possess favorable phase stability as well as configurations amenable to Li diffusion. Utilizing this computational framework, validated through multiple successful synthesis and characterization experiments, we not only demonstrate the design of LiCr$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$O$_2$, showcasing initial charge capacity of 234 mAhg$^{-1}$ and 320 mAhg$^{-1}$ in its 20% Li-excess variant Li$_{1.2}$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.2}$O$_2$, but also present the elemental ordering statistics for 32 elements, informed by one of the most extensive first-principles studies of ordering tendencies known to us.</description>

      <title>Language Models Enable Data-Augmented Synthesis Planning for Inorganic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inorganic synthesis planning currently relies primarily on heuristic approaches or machine-learning models trained on limited datasets, which constrains its generality. We demonstrate that language models, without task-specific fine-tuning, can recall synthesis conditions. Off-the-shelf models, such as GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0 Flash and Llama 4 Maverick, achieve a Top-1 precursor-prediction accuracy of up to 53.8 % and a Top-5 performance of 66.1 % on a held-out set of 1,000 reactions. They also predict calcination and sintering temperatures with mean absolute errors below 126 {\deg}C, matching specialized regression methods. Ensembling these language models further enhances predictive accuracy and reduces inference cost per prediction by up to 70 %. We subsequently employ language models to generate 28,548 synthetic reaction recipes, which we combine with literature-mined examples to pretrain a transformer-based model, SyntMTE. After fine-tuning on the combined dataset, SyntMTE reduces mean-absolute error in sintering temperature prediction to 73 {\deg}C and in calcination temperature to 98 {\deg}C. This strategy improves models by up to 8.7 % compared with baselines trained exclusively on experimental data. Finally, in a case study on Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolytes, we demonstrate that SyntMTE reproduces the experimentally observed dopant-dependent sintering trends. Our hybrid workflow enables scalable, data-efficient inorganic synthesis planning.</description>

      <title>Inferring Grain Size Distributions from Magnetic Hysteresis in M-type Hexaferrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic-dynamic framework to infer latent grain size distribution from magnetic hysteresis data in M-type hexaferrite materials, offering an alternative to imaging-based characterization. A stochastic nucleation-growth process yields a Modified Lognormal Power-law grain size distribution. This is combined with Brown's relation to obtain a coercivity probability distribution, which is embedded within a dynamic magnetization model. A key feature is the joint estimation of microstructural parameters, including the critical grain radius, through inverse optimization of full hysteresis loops. Experimental validation on hydrothermally synthesized strontium hexaferrite subjected to nitrogen treatment and recalcination reveals interpretable trajectories of nucleation, growth, and structural memory encoded in the magnetic response.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potentials for modeling alloys across compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials properties depend strongly on chemical composition, i.e., the relative amounts of each chemical element. Changes in composition lead to entirely different chemical arrangements, which vary in complexity from perfectly ordered (i.e., stoichiometric compounds) to completely disordered (i.e., solid solutions). Accurately capturing this range of chemical arrangements remains a major challenge, limiting the predictive accuracy of machine learning potentials (MLPs) in materials modeling. Here, we combine information theory and machine learning to optimize the sampling of chemical motifs and design MLPs that effectively capture the behavior of metallic alloys across their entire compositional and structural landscape. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by predicting the compositional dependence of various material properties - including stacking-fault energies, short-range order, heat capacities, and phase diagrams - for the AuPt and CuAu binary alloys, the ternary CrCoNi, and the TiTaVW high-entropy alloy. Extensive comparison against experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this approach in enabling materials modeling with high physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Collective Interference Phonon Spin Manifested in Infrared Circular Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical field description of ``phonon spin" relies on the invariance of a continuous elastic field under infinitesimal rotation. However, a local ``medium element" in the continuous field may contain large numbers of vibrational particles at microscopic level, like for complex lattices with many atoms in a unit cell. We find this causes the phonon spin in real materials no longer a simple sum of each atom rotation, but a collective interference of many particles, since phonons are phase-coherent vibrational modes across unit cells. We demonstrate the many-particle-interference phonon spin manifested as the dipole moment rotating (DMR) of charge-polarized unit cell, by deriving the infrared circular dichroism (ICD) with phonon-photon interaction in complex lattices. We compare the DMR with the local atom rotation without interference, and exemplify their distinct ICD spectrum in a chiral lattice model and two realistic chiral materials. Detectable ICD measurements are proposed in $\alpha$-quartz with Weyl phonon at Gamma point. Our study underlies the important role of many-particle-interference and uncovers a deeper insight of phonon spin in real materials with complex lattices.</description>

      <title>Interface-controlled antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are the key building blocks of high-performance spintronic devices. While conventional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials, employing antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds can significantly increase operation speed and packing density. Current prototypes of AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) exploit antiferromagnets either as spin-filter insulating barriers or as metal electrodes supporting bulk spin-dependent currents. Here, we highlight a largely overlooked AFMTJ prototype, where bulk-spin-degenerate electrodes with an A-type AFM stacking form magnetically uncompensated interfaces, enabling spin-polarized tunneling currents and a sizable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Using first-principles quantum-transport calculations and the van der Waals (vdW) metal Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ as a representative A-type AFM electrode, we demonstrate a large negative TMR arising solely from the alignment of interfacial magnetic moments. This prototype of AFMTJs can also be realized with various non-vdW A-type AFM metals that support roughness-insensitive surface magnetization. Beyond TMR, AFMTJs based on A-type antiferromagnets allow convenient switching of the N\'eel vector, opening a new paradigm for AFM spintronics that leverages spin-dependent properties at AFM interfaces.</description>

      <title>Optimizing optical properties of bilayer PtSe$_2$: the role of twist angle and hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer exceptional tunability in their electronic properties. In this paper, we explore how twisting and hydrostatic pressure can be leveraged to engineer the electronic and optical characteristics of bilayer PtSe$_2$. Using state-of-the-art first-principles density functional methods, we calculate the electronic band structure and the imaginary part of the dielectric function across multiple twist angles and pressure values. We find, that at the twist angle $\theta=13.17^\circ$, bilayer PtSe$_2$, which is intrinsically an indirect semiconductor, transforms into a direct-gap semiconductor. Moreover, we demonstrate that hydrostatic out-of-plane pressure boosts near-infrared optical activity, further expanding the functional potential of PtSe$_2$ bilayers. The demonstrated high tunability of electronic and optical properties by twisting and pressure opens new application directions of PtSe$_2$ in optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Control of Spin Orbit Coupling and Circular Photogalvanic Effect in a True Ferrielectric Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials possessing long range ordering of magnetic spins or electric dipoles have been the focus of condensed matter research. Among them, ferri-systems with two sublattices of unequal/noncollinear spins or electric dipoles are expected to combine the properties of ferro- and antiferro-systems, but lack experimental observations in single phase materials. This is particularly true for the ferrielectric system, since the electric dipoles usually can be redefined to incorporate the two sublattices into one, making it indistinguishable from ferroelectric. This raises doubts about whether or not ferrielectricity can be considered as an independent ferroic order. Here we report the observation of true ferrielectric behaviors in a hybrid single crystal (MV)[SbBr5] (MV2+ = N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium or methylviologen), where the two electric dipole sublattices switch asynchronously, thus cannot be reduced to ferroelectric by redefining the unit cell. Furthermore, the complex dipole configuration imparts circularly polarized light sensitivity to the system. An electric field can modulate the non-collinear dipole sublattices and even induce a transition from ferrielectric to ferroelectric state, thereby tuning the helicity-dependent photocurrent. This study opens a new paradigm for the study of true irreducible ferrielectricity (a new class of polar system) and provides an effective approach to the electric field control of spin-orbit coupling and circular photogalvanic effect.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Manufacture of Phase Pure Two-Dimensional Metallic MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic monolayered [or two - dimensional (2D)] MoS2 nanosheets show tremendous promise for energy storage and catalysis applications. However, state-of-the-art chemical exfoliation methods require &gt; 48 hours to produce milligrams of metallic 2D MoS2. Further, chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets are a mixture of metallic (1T or 1T prime 50% to 70%) and semiconducting (2H 30% to 50%) phases. Here, we demonstrate large-scale and rapid (&gt;600 grams per hour) production of purely metallic phase 2D MoS2 (and WS2, MoSe2) nanosheets using microwave irradiation. Atomic resolution imaging shows 1T or 1T prime metallic phase in basal plane - consistent with close to 100% metallic phase concentration measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The high 1T phase concentration results in the highest exchange current density of 0.175 plus-minus 0.03 mA cm-2 and among the lowest Tafel slopes (39 - 43 mV dec-1) measured to date for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur pouch cell batteries, record-high volumetric capacitance of 753 plus-minus 3.6 F cm-3 and specific capacity of 1245 plus-minus 16 mAh g-1 (at exceptionally low electrolyte to sulfur ratio = 2 microlitre g-1), respectively, are obtained. Our method provides a practical pathway for producing high quality purely metallic phase 2D materials for high performance energy devices.</description>

      <title>DFT-based insight into finite-temperature properties of ferroelectric perovskites with lone-pair: the case of CsGeX$_3$ (X=Cl, Br, I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics remain in the focus of scientific attention for decades owing to their fundamental and practical appeal. Recently, ferroelectricity has been demonstrated in semiconducting halide perovskites, offering both a rare combination of ferroelectricity and semiconductivity in the same material and a possible alternative to the prevailing perovskite oxide ferroelectrics. We propose a route to simulating such materials at finite temperatures capable of reproducing key experimental and first-principle data, such as Curie temperature, phase transition sequence, spontaneous polarization, and soft mode frequencies. The key methodological finding is the superior performance of hybrid exchange correlation functionals in parametrization of effective Hamiltonians for ferroelectrics with lone pair. The parametrization for effective Hamiltonians for CsGeX$_3$, (X=Cl, Br, I) is reported. The application of methodology to study polarization reversal in CsGeX$_3$, allows for the development of a ``minimalistic" model for polarization reversal in ferroelectrics that provides an insight into the mechanisms of polarization reversal and its key features, such as the relationship between the coercive field, temperature, and AC field frequency. Importantly, the model reveals the origin of the well-known and ever-puzzling overestimation of coercive fields in computations. Furthermore, we report a variety of finite-temperature properties of CsGeX$_3$, ferroelectrics, such as dielectric susceptibility, pyroelectric coefficients, and energy storage density, which reveal that these halide perovskites possess properties comparable to their oxide counterparts. We believe that our work provides significant methodological advancements, deepens fundamental understanding of ferroelectrics, and reveals the potential of halide perovskite ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Spin-Lattice Dynamics with Machine-Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate atomic-scale simulations of magnetic materials require precise handling of coupled spin-lattice degrees of freedom. Traditional spin-lattice dynamics (SLD), employing Newtonian equation for lattice evolution and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for spins, encounters severe limitations with machine-learning potentials, including poor energy conservation and excessive computational costs due to non-symplectic integration. In this work, we propose TSPIN, a unified Nos\'e-Hoover Chain-based method overcoming these issues. By extending the classical Lagrangian with explicit spin kinetic terms and thermostat variables, we derive symplectic Hamiltonian formulations suitable for NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles. The method integrates spin and lattice dynamics simultaneously, ensuring robust energy conservation and significantly reducing computational cost. Benchmarks against analytical harmonic spin-lattice models confirm its accuracy, and application to FCC iron using a DeepSPIN MLP demonstrates superior numerical stability and near-linear computational scaling compared to the conventional LLG method. Thus, TSPIN provides a powerful, broadly applicable framework for efficiently simulating complex spin-lattice phenomena and multi-degree-of-freedom systems at large scales.</description>

      <title>Disorder by Design: Unveiling Local Structure and Functional Insights in High Entropy Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy oxides (HEOs) are a rapidly growing class of compositionally complex ceramics in which configurational disorder is engineered to unlock novel functionality. While average crystallographic symmetry is often retained, local structural and chemical disorder, including cation size and valence mismatch, oxygen sublattice distortions, and site-specific bonding, strongly governs ionic transport, redox behavior, magnetic ordering, and dielectric response. This review outlines how these modes of disorder manifest across key oxide families such as rock salt, spinel, fluorite, and perovskite. We highlight recent advances in spectroscopy, total scattering, and high-resolution microscopy enable multi-scale insight into short- and intermediate-range order. By integrating experimental observations with theoretical modeling of entropy and local energetics, we establish a framework linking structural heterogeneity to emergent properties. These insights not only deepen our fundamental understanding of disorder-property relationships but also offer a path toward rational design of tunable materials for catalysis, energy storage, electronics, and much more.</description>

      <title>Assessing Vibrational Frequencies of CO Adsorbed on Cerium Oxide Surfaces Using SCAN and r2SCAN Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational frequency of carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed on ceria-based catalysts serves as a sensitive probe for identifying exposed surface facets, provided that experimental reference data on well-defined single-crystal surfaces and reliable theoretical assignments are available. Previous studies have shown that the hybrid DFT approach using the HSE06 functional yields good agreement with experimental observations, whereas the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with PBE+U does not. In this work, we assess the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals by comparing the meta-GGA functionals SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals with HSE06 in predicting CO vibrational frequencies on cerium oxide surfaces. The meta-GGA functionals offer no significant improvement for oxidized CeO2(111) and CeO2(110) surfaces and fail to localize excess charge on the reduced surfaces. Adding a Hubbard U term improves charge localization, but the predicted vibrational frequencies still fall short of HSE06 accuracy. These limitations are attributed to the meta-GGA's inability to adequately capture facet- and configuration-specific donation and back-donation effects, which influence the C-O bond length and CO force constant upon adsorption. Despite the higher computational cost when used with plane-wave basis sets, hybrid DFT remains essential for accurate interpretation of experimental results.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Activator Solutions for Geopolymer Synthesis: Thermochemical Stability, Sequencing, and Standardisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geopolymers present a sustainable alternative to conventional binders, however, their commercial viability is hindered by a lack of standardised methods for preparing stabile activator solutions; alkaline feedstocks critical to geopolymer synthesis. This study presents a combined experimental and modelling approach to evaluate the thermochemical stability, solubility constraints, and silica speciation behaviour of sodium silicate-based activators. Using quantitative 29Si NMR analysis, thermodynamic stability and three-dimensional solubility modelling, this research identifies optimal preparation conditions that minimise irreversible precipitation risks and optimises mixing periods. Key findings indicate that higher solution temperatures associated with optimised activator solution preparation were found to enhance thermochemical stability and reactivity, while cooling increased viscosity and the likelihood of unstable solution behaviour, which may necessitate discarding. The order in which feedstocks are combined directly affects whether the solution becomes unstable, with an optimal sequence of water, alkali-hydroxide, soluble silicate found to ensure greater process reliability. A predictive model and accompanying visual tools enable practitioners to assess solution viability and define stability windows by quantifying initial and final/unstable periods and temperatures based on feedstock composition and solution temperature. These results contribute to improved reproducibility and quality control in geopolymer research and represent a step toward developing standard operating procedures for activator solution synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open materials systems are often inaccessible to conventional atomistic simulations, which add and remove atoms by creating high-energy defects that may be sampled with vanishing probability. This longstanding challenge motivates a new Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method that maps the grand canonical problem to a canonical system involving non-interacting fictitious particles. To trial deletions or insertions, a real or fictitious particle is selected according to an energy-based biasing scheme and gradually transformed over a microcanonical molecular dynamics trajectory. The method is validated, optimized, and used to compute point defect free energies that allow for arbitrary structures and interactions among multiple defects. Several grain boundaries are then equilibrated in a physically representative open ensemble, demonstrating a new approach to studying interface structures and their phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen bond symmetrization in high-pressure ice clathrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen bond symmetrization is a fundamental pressure-induced transformation in which the distinction between donor and acceptor sites vanishes, resulting in a symmetric hydrogen-bond network. While extensively studied in pure ice, most notably during the ice VII to ice X transition, this phenomenon remains less well characterized in hydrogen hydrates. In this work, we investigate hydrogen bond symmetrization in the high-pressure phases of hydrogen hydrate (H2-H2O and H2-D2O) through a combined approach of Raman spectroscopy and first-principles quantum atomistic simulations. We focus on the C2 and C3 filled-ice phases, using both hydrogenated and deuterated water frameworks. Our results reveal that quantum fluctuations and the interaction between the encaged H2 molecules and the host lattice play a crucial role in driving the symmetrization process. Remarkably, we find that in both C2 and C3 phases, hydrogen bond symmetrization occurs via a continuous crossover at significantly lower pressures than in pure ice, without any change in the overall crystal symmetry. These findings provide new insight into the quantum-driven mechanisms of bond symmetrization in complex hydrogen-bonded systems under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Ab initio functional-independent calculations of the clamped Pockels tensor of tetragonal barium titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ab initio method to calculate the clamped Pockels tensor of ferroelectric materials from density-functional theory, the modern theory of polarization exploiting the electric-enthalpy functional, and automated first- and second-order finite-difference derivatives of the polarizations and the Hellmann-Feynman forces. Thanks to the functional-independent capabilities of our approach, we can determine the Pockels tensor of tetragonal barium titanate (BTO) beyond the local density approximation (LDA), with arbitrary exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, for example, PBEsol. The latter, together with RRKJ ultra-soft pseudo-potentials (PP) and a supercell exhibiting local titanium off-centering, enables us to stabilize the negative optical phonon modes encountered in tetragonal BTO when LDA and norm-conserving PP are combined. As a result, the correct value range of $r_{51}$, the largest experimental Pockels coefficient of BTO, is recovered. We also reveal that $r_{51}$ increases with decreasing titanium off-centering for this material. The lessons learned from the structural, dielectric, and vibrational investigations of BTO will be essential to design next-generation electro-optical modulators based on the Pockels effect.</description>

      <title>Penta-twinned gold nanoparticles under pressure: a comprehensive study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the high-pressure optical and mechanical properties of penta-twinned gold nanoparticles (PT-AuNPs) of different geometries: decahedra, rods and bipyramids. Our results show that, unlike single-crystal (SC-AuNPs), PT-AuNPs preserve both their non-cubic crystal structures and their overall morphology up to 30 GPa. This structural integrity under compression is related to an enhanced mechanical resilience of PT-AuNPs, despite exhibiting bulk moduli comparable to those of SC-AuNPs. Notwithstanding, comparable pressure-induced localized surface plasmon resonance redshifts - for all nanoparticle geometries - were observed. Our analysis indicates that these shifts are primarily caused by changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium, with electron density compression playing a minor role, contrasting with the behavior in SC-AuNPs, where electron density compression has a greater influence.</description>

      <title>Inferring Material Parameters from Current-Voltage Curves in Organic Solar Cells via Neural-Network-Based Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for estimating material parameters in solar cells. Traditional methods for parameter extraction often rely on time-consuming numerical simulations that fail to capture the full complexity of the parameter space and discard valuable information from suboptimal simulations. In this study, we introduce a novel workflow for parameter estimation in organic solar cells based on a combination of numerical simulations and neural networks. The workflow begins with the selection of an appropriate experimental dataset, followed by the definition of a device model that accurately describes the experiment. To reduce computational complexity, the number of variable parameters is carefully selected, and reasonable ranges are set for each parameter. Instead of directly fitting the experimental data using a numerical model, a neural network was trained on a large dataset of simulated results, allowing for efficient exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space. This approach not only accelerates the parameter estimation process but also provides valuable insights into the likelihood and uncertainty of the estimated parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on organic solar cells based on the PBDB-TF-T1:BTP-4F-12 material system, demonstrating the potential of machine learning for rapid and comprehensive characterization of emerging photovoltaic materials.</description>

      <title>Crystal field tuned spin-flip luminescence in NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered magnetic materials potentially hold the key to future applications based on optical control and manipulation of magnetism. NiPS3, a prototype member of this family, is antiferromagnetic below 155 K and exhibits sharp photoluminescence associated to a transition between a triplet ground state and a singlet excited state. The nature of the luminescent transition is a matter of current debate and so is an eventual fundamental link of this excitation to magnetism. Here we provide answers through experiments and calculations. We fabricate samples with metal and ligand substitutions which alter the Neel transition temperature and measure the effects of these changes on the temperature dependent photoluminescence. We perform crystal field and charge transfer multiplet calculations to explain the origin of the excitation and identify the effects of the magnetic ground state on its properties. These measurements and calculations provide a comprehensive explanation for the observed properties and a template for finding similar materials exhibiting spin-flip luminescence.</description>

      <title>2D MXene-Based Photocatalysts for Efficient Water Splitting and Hydrogen Evolution: A brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting offers a viable and sustainable method for hydrogen production. MXenes, a class of 2D transition-metal carbides/nitrides, have emerged as potential photocatalysts and co-catalysts due to their tunable electronic properties, high conductivity, and surface functionality. This review explores recent advances in MXene-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production, discussing their synthesis, electronic structures, and photocatalytic mechanisms. The key challenges, including stability issues, charge recombination, and bandgap optimisation, are critically analysed. Finally, future research directions are outlined to improve MXene-based systems for large-scale hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Sodium induced beneficial effects in wide bandgap Cu(In,Ga)S2 solar cell with 15.7% efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study underscores the pivotal role of sodium (Na) supply in optimizing the optoelectronic properties of wide bandgap (~1.6 eV) Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) thin film absorbers for high efficiency solar cells. Our findings demonstrate that the synergistic use of Na from the glass substrate, in conjunction with in-situ sodium fluoride (NaF) co-evaporation, significantly enhances the structural and optoelectronic properties of the CIGS. CIGS grown under either Na-deficient or excess conditions exhibits inferior microstructural and optoelectronic properties, whereas an optimal Na supply leads to enhanced photovoltaic performance. Optimal Na incorporation minimizes vertical gallium fluctuations and improves the grain size and crystallinity. An absolute 1 sun calibrated photoluminescence (PL) measurement reveals a substantial suppression of bulk defects and a reduction in non-radiative losses, resulting in a high quasi-fermi level splitting ({\Delta}EF) of 1.07 eV, 93 meV higher than in Na-deficient CIGS with the same bandgap. Optimal Na supply further increases excited carrier decay time, as revealed from time-resolved PL, and hole doping density. Cross-sectional hyperspectral cathodoluminescence mapping reveals that optimal Na supply significantly reduces defect density near the surface, thereby effectively translating {\Delta}EF to open-circuit voltage (VOC). As a result, a champion wide bandgap CIGS solar cell with a cadmium-free ZnSnO buffer layer achieved an impressive VOC of 971 meV and an active area power conversion efficiency of 15.7%, highlighting its potential for advancing tandem photovoltaic technologies with stable inorganic top cell.</description>

      <title>Electronic Correlations Control Interlayer Coupling and Magnetic Transition in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/MnBr$_3$ Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator. However, its low N\'eel temperature of $\sim 25\,\mathrm{K}$ severely restricts its practical applications. Here, we propose a van der Waals heterostructure composed of monolayer MBT (ML-MBT) and monolayer MnBr$_3$, an intrinsic Chern insulator possessing a high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C} \sim 200\,\mathrm{K}$). By employing density functional theory calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that interfacing ML-MBT with MnBr$_3$ significantly enhances the $T_\mathrm{C}$ of ML-MBT by a factor of four to five. Electronic correlations characterized by the Hubbard parameter $U_2$ for Mn-$d$ orbitals in MnBr$_3$ play a crucial role in governing magnetic coupling within the system. At a moderate correlation strength of $U_2 = 3.0\,\mathrm{eV}$, slight structural distortions in MnBr$_3$ break intralayer symmetry, enabling robust interlayer ferromagnetic coupling and yielding a single, unified magnetic transition. Increasing $U_2$ reduces these structural distortions, weakens interlayer coupling, and induces two distinct magnetic transitions, indicating interlayer magnetic decoupling. Thus, the MBT/MnBr$_3$ heterostructure offers a novel approach for controlling magnetic order and enhancing the performance of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>A first-principles investigation of altermagnetism in CrSb2 under applied pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the GGA+U framework to explore the electronic and magnetic properties of CrSb2 under varying hydrostatic pressures. CrSb2 exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of around 0.5 eV around the Fermi level and the d-wave symmetric Fermi surface. Our magnetic susceptibility measurements further confirm the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state in CrSb2 , a prerequisite for altermagnetism. The presence of collinear AFM and spin-band splitting without the application of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) supports CrSb2 as a potential contender for altermagnet. With increasing pressure, we have observed an intricate evolution of spin splitting in the valence and conduction bands, governed by changes in orbital contributions. The observation of the structural phase transition above 10 GPa is in qualitative agreement with the previous experimental findings. Our results not only support the classification of CrSb2 as an altermagnetic candidate but also provide critical insight into the role of pressure in tuning its spin-dependent electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bulk photocurrent probe Z2 topological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting topological phase transitions in bulk is challenging due to the limitations of surface sensitive probes like ARPES. Here, we demonstrate that nonlinear bulk photocurrents, specifically shift and injection currents, serve as effective probes of Z_2 topological transitions. These photocurrents show a robust polarity reversal across the Z_2 phase transition, offering a direct optical signature that distinguishes strong topological phases from weak or trivial ones. This effect originates from a reorganization of key band geometric quantities, the Berry curvature and shift vector, on time-reversal-invariant momentum planes. Using a low energy Dirac model, we trace this behaviour to a band inversion in the time-reversal-invariant momentum plane that drives the topological transition. We validate these findings through tight-binding model for Bi_2Te_3 and first-principles calculations for ZrTe_5 and BiTeI, where the topological phase can be tuned by pressure or temperature. Our results establish nonlinear photocurrent as a sensitive and broadly applicable probe of Z_2 topological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined X-ray and neutron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and 121Sb NMR studies of AgSbTe2, supported by first-principles calculations aiming to elucidate its crystal structure. While diffraction methods cannot unambiguously resolve the structure, Raman and NMR data, together with electric field gradient calculations, strongly support the rhombohedral R-3m phase. Moreover, the agreement between experimental and calculated Raman spectra further corroborates this result, resolving the 60-year sold debate about the exact crystal structure of the AgSbTe2 compound.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Dopants as Growth Modifiers in Cu-Cr-O delafossites: A Study of Incorporation Limits and Film Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films were grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition with various extrinsic dopants (Al, Mg, Mn, Sc, Y, and Zn) targeted at 5 at % to investigate how such doping influences their structure and properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the actual dopant incorporation is well below the nominal 5 %, with only Al and Sc present above detection. An off-stoichiometric Cu-Cr-O composition is determined, with no secondary phases detected. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that films grown on c-plane sapphire are epitaxial near the substrate interface but relax into a polycrystalline structure beyond 20 nm, while films on silicon are polycrystalline throughout. All films show high p-type conductivity (on the order of 10-10^2 Scm-1) attributable to the excess oxygen, with no significant variation among different dopants. Optical transmission measurements indicate a slight red-shift (~20 nm) of the absorption edge for all doped films, likely arising from strain effects and subtle structural disorder introduced during growth. We discuss the influence of lattice strain (investigated by X-ray diffraction sin {\psi} squared measurements showing residual strain) and small polaron absorption behavior in these films. Despite limited incorporation of dopants, subtle structural and optical shifts suggest that dopant precursor chemistry and growth conditions play a significant role in influencing film stoichiometry and properties.</description>

      <title>Faceting transition in aluminum as a grain boundary phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries facet due to anisotropic grain boundary energies: While the faceted boundary has a larger area than the corresponding straight boundary, a significantly lower energy of the facets compared to a straight segment can drive the faceting. This picture is complicated by faceting/defaceting transitions where the free energy difference between the two states depends on the temperature. Here, we use atomistic computer simulations to show how such a transition in a $\Sigma 3$ $[11\overline{1}]$ tilt grain boundary in Al is in fact a grain boundary phase transition (also called complexion transition). This means that the faceted and defaceted boundaries are associated with different atomic structures, which have different thermodynamic stability ranges. At low temperatures, the grain boundary phase associated with faceting is stable, while at high temperatures the flat grain boundary phase is stable. We also report on our thorough tests of Al interatomic potentials for this purpose, which include comparisons to density-functional theory calculations. Our chosen potential performs well for our grain boundaries. As a consequence we were able to obtain results that align with previous experimental results.</description>

      <title>Significant role of first-principles electron-phonon coupling in the electronic and thermoelectric properties of LiZnAs and ScAgC semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The half-Heusler (hH) compounds are currently considered promising thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their favorable thermopower and electrical conductivity. Accurate estimates of these properties are therefore highly desirable and require a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport. To enable such estimations, we carry out comprehensive first-principles computations of one of the primary factors limiting carrier transport, namely the electron-phonon ($e-ph$) interaction, in representative hH semiconductors such as LiZnAs and ScAgC. Our study first investigates the $e-ph$ renormalization of electronic dispersion based on the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. We then solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under multiple relaxation-time approximations (RTAs) to evaluate the carrier transport properties. Phonon-limited electron and hole mobilities are comparatively assessed using the linearized self-energy and momentum RTAs (SERTA and MRTA), and the exact or iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions within $e-ph$ coupling. Electrical transport coefficients for TE performance are also comparatively analyzed under the constant RTA (CRTA), SERTA, and MRTA schemes. The lattice thermal conductivity, determined from phonon-phonon interaction, is further reduced through nanostructuring techniques. The bulk LiZnAs (ScAgC) compound achieves the highest figure of merit ($zT$) of 1.05 (0.78) at 900 K with an electron doping concentration of 10$^{18}$ (10$^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ under the MRTA scheme. This value significantly increases to 1.53 (1.0) for a 20 nm nanostructured sample. The remarkably high $zT$ achieved through inherently present phonon-induced electron scattering and the grain-boundary effect in semiconductors opens a promising path for discovering highly efficient and accurate hH materials for TE technology.</description>

      <title>Photomagnetic-Chiral Anisotropy mediated by Chirality-Driven Asymmetric Spin Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-magnetic effects (PMEs), intrinsic to transition metals, arises from the interaction between light-induced angu-lar momentum and electronic spin. These effects are suppressed in noble metals with high symmetry and electron density. Introducing chiral structures can induce photomagnetic-chiral anisotropy (PM-ChA) of metals by linking chirality and spin dynamics. However, a theoretical explain remains elusive. Here, we investigated the mechanism of PM-ChA in tetrahelix-stacked chiral nanostructured gold chains (CNACs) using first-principles calculations. Non-equilibrium Green's function calculations reveal that chiral potentials enhance spin channel asymmetry by amplify-ing spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced spin splitting. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations further identify SOC as the bridge connecting chiral spintronics to PME, where chirality-driven spin flips from asymmetric geometries generate opposing photomagnetic fields in materials of different handedness. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in chiral nanostructured gold films and provide a theoretical instruction for design metallic spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Chiral phonons, circularly polarized lattice vibrations carrying intrinsic angular momentum, offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling heat flow, manipulating quantum states through spin-phonon coupling, and realizing exotic transport phenomena. Despite their fundamental importance, a universal framework for identifying and classifying these elusive excitations has remained out of reach. Here, we address this challenge by establishing a comprehensive symmetry-based theory that systematically classifies the helicity and the velocity-angular momentum tensor underlying phonon magnetization in thermal transport across all 230 crystallographic space groups. Our approach, grounded in fundamental representations of phononic angular momentum, reveals three distinct classes of crystals: achiral crystals with vanishing angular momentum, chiral crystals with s-wave helicity, and achiral crystals exhibiting higher-order helicity patterns beyond the s-wave. By performing high-throughput computations and symmetry analysis of the dynamical matrices for 11614 crystalline compounds, we identified 2738 materials exhibiting chiral phonon modes and shortlisted the 170 most promising candidates for future experimental investigation. These results are compiled into an open-access Chiral Phonon Materials Database website, enabling rapid screening for materials with desired chiral phonon properties. Our theoretical framework transcends phonons--it provides a universal paradigm for classifying chiral excitations in crystalline lattices, from magnons to electronic quasiparticles.</description>

Abstract: The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles have gained significant attention as a means to enhance data sharing, collaboration, and reuse across various domains. Here, we explore the potential benefits of implementing FAIR data practices within engineering projects, with a monetary focus in the German context, but by considering aspects which are relatively universal. By examining the FAIR-data aspect of a Materials Science and Engineering PhD project, it becomes evident that substantial cost savings can be achieved. The estimated savings are 2,600 Euros per year from the PhD project considered. This study underscores the importance of implementing FAIR data practices in engineering projects and highlights some significant economic benefits that can be derived from such initiatives. By embracing FAIR principles, organizations in the engineering sector can unlock the full potential of their data, optimize resource allocation, and drive innovation in a cost-effective manner.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Effects Underlying Dynamic Heterogeneity in Miscible Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) with Poly(ethylene oxide)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Such heterogeneity is understood to arise from differences between the intrinsic dynamical fluctuations associated with one component versus another. However, the nature of the dynamic coupling between these components and how it depends on composition, temperature, and environmental fluctuations is not fully understood. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to characterize nanoscale dynamic heterogeneity in miscible blends of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a function of both temperature and blend composition. Probed over timescales of 100~ps, local PMMA segmental dynamics in blends align with neat PMMA when normalized by $T_\text{g}$, whereas PEO exhibits enhanced mobility caused by free-volume effects. The effects of dynamical coupling are found to be asymmetric between the extent of enhancement to PMMA and suppression of PEO dynamics based on analysis of local environment composition within blends. Asymmetric effects in the melt state are also identified over longer timescales according to a Rouse mode analysis over larger sub-chains for each species. These results provide fundamental insights into how dynamic heterogeneity manifests at the nanoscale, across conditions and compositions in miscible polymer blends. They establish a foundation for exploring whether such asymmetries are generalizable and how dynamic heterogeneity can be tuned through temperature, composition, and morphology.</description>

      <title>Emission Properties of a Hybrid Metallized Diamond(001) Photocathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral emission characteristics of a proof-of-concept hybrid metallized diamond(001) photocathode are presented. The quantum efficiency (QE) is shown to be determined by the photo-injection efficiency across the ohmic contact at the back metallized face, whereas the mean transverse energy (MTE) of the photoemitted electrons is consistent with a (optical)phonon-assisted and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon mechanism [Phys. Rev. Applied 23, 054065 (2025)] following electron drift transport to the untreated diamond(001) front emission face. Emission is observed from both the lower and upper conduction bands of diamond with positive and negative electron affinity respectively. A potential route to the realization of a red-visible photocathode based on this concept with a sub-50meV MTE and a QE greater than 0.1% is discussed.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation times grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure--dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean--field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure--dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure--dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure--dynamics correlation.</description>

      <title>Stress-Testing Multimodal Foundation Models for Crystallographic Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations. Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and (iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability in large-scale multimodal models. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/StressTestingMMFMinCR.</description>

      <title>Role of topotactic hydrogen in Superconductivity of Infinite-layer Nickelate NdNiO$_{2}$: A first-principles and variational Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing combination of first-principles calculations, low-energy model construction, and variational Monte Carlo solution of the ab-initio derived Hubbard model, we study the effect of hydrogenation in the electronic structure and superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelate, NdNiO$_2$. We find that the introduction of hydrogen at the apical oxygen vacancy position strongly influences the Wannier function corresponding to the effective interstitial orbital at the Ni site bound to the hydrogen. This results in the near disappearance of the electron pocket at the $k_z$ = $\pi$ Fermi surface, keeping that of $k_z$ = 0 unchanged, compared to the dehydrogenated case. The two-band model thus remains valid even in the presence of H. The calculated superconducting order parameters both in absence and presence of H, show a two-hump superconductivity arising the two overlapping domes, one arising from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and another arising from interstitial orbital degree of freedom. Hydrogenation strengthens the latter, marginally affecting the former.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of visible-light hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in real space and time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials support exotic polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion that enable subdiffraction focusing and enhanced light-matter interactions. Visible-frequency hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) offer significant advantages over hyperbolic phonon polaritons, which operate in the infrared frequency range - namely lower losses and greater technological relevance. However, these HPPs remained experimentally inaccessible until the recent identification of molybdenum(IV) oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Here we achieve the first direct real-space and real-time visualization of hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in natural materials using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy with femtosecond time resolution and nanometer spatial resolution. Our direct imaging enables measurement of HPP propagation velocities and lengths, real-time observation of plasmon-material edge interactions, experimental validation of hyperbolic dispersion through polarization-dependent experiments, and direct visualization of hyperbolic focusing phenomena. This spatiotemporal visualization validates theoretical predictions while establishing an experimental foundation for exploiting these unusual light-matter states in fundamental studies of hyperbolic media and nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials are a useful platform for emerging microelectronic, optoelectronic, and neuromorphic devices, but their discovery is hindered by the high computational cost of electronic structure modeling, the complexity of underlying mechanisms, and the challenges of experimental validation. Here, we present a physics-informed machine learning framework that accelerates the discovery of thermally driven MIT materials. Using a trained classifier, we screen a crystal structure database to identify promising candidates for higher fidelity simulations. We focus on Ca$_2$Fe$_3$O$_8$, CaCo$_2$O$_4$, and CaMn$_2$O$_4$, and use density functional theory (DFT) to determine their electronic and magnetic ground states and assess their microscopic MIT mechanisms. We further apply machine learning regression models to estimate their transition temperatures and employ synthesis prediction tools to identify likely precursors and reaction routes. This integrated approach reduces the time and effort required to identify, understand, and synthesize new MIT materials, providing a generalizable pathway for accelerating correlated quantum materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved pump-probe soft X-ray ptychography and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) were employed to study the magnetic domain wall dynamics in microstructures of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) with a weak growth-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses. An oscillating magnetic field at frequencies from tens of MHz to GHz and up to 4 mT magnitude excited dynamic modes in the domain walls along with the vortex core gyration. The domain wall dynamics include the translation of inversion points of the OOP magnetization and nucleation of one-dimensional spin waves.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in 2D Halide Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonons in chiral crystal structures can be circularly polarized, making them chiral. Chiral phonons carry angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites, versatile direct band gap semiconductors, can easily form chiral structures by incorporating chiral organic cations. As a result, they exhibit phenomena such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and the spin Seebeck effect, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields trained against density functional theory calculations, we confirm the presence of chiral phonons, a potential key factor for these effects. Our analysis reveals that low-energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework, primarily exhibit chirality. Under a temperature gradient, these chiral phonons generate substantial angular momentum, leading to experimentally observable effects. These findings position chiral 2D perovskites as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between phononic, electronic, spintronic, and thermal properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>

      <title>Filling a gap in materials mechanics: Nanoindentation at high constant strain rates upto $10^5 s^{-1}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central focus in high strain rate research is understanding the dynamic behavior of materials at strain rates where a strength upturn is observed. While strength upturns at strain rates of $10^3$ to $10^4~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ have been widely reported in the literature, their occurrence in certain materials remains controversial, and the underlying physics driving this phenomenon is not yet fully understood. Current mechanical testing methods are limited, as no single technique spans the full strain rate range of $10^1$ to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ where this phenomenon is expected, and a unified technique would enable consistent post-deformation characterization with minimal error. To address this, we developed a customized piezoelectric in situ nanomechanical test setup, enabling constant indentation strain rates up to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for the first time. Using this system, we examined rate-dependent hardness in single-crystalline molybdenum, nanocrystalline nickel, and amorphous fused silica over strain rates from $10^1$ to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, remarkably revealing a hardness upturn in all three materials. Further, post-deformation analysis of single-crystalline molybdenum revealed that the hardness upturn was primarily driven by increased dislocation density, with phonon drag -- traditionally considered a dominant contributor -- playing a minimal role.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Resonance in a Magnetically Dilute Percolating Ferromagnet: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) serves as a powerful probe of magnetization dynamics and anisotropy in percolating ferromagnets, where short-range interactions govern long-range magnetic order. We apply this approach to Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N ($x \simeq 8$\%), a dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor, combining FMR and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Our results confirm the percolative nature of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)N, with a Curie temperature $T_{\mathrm{C}} = 12$ K, and reveal that despite magnetic dilution, key features of conventional ferromagnets are retained. FMR measurements establish a robust uniaxial anisotropy, dictated by Mn$^{3+}$ single-ion anisotropy, with an easy-plane character at low Mn content. While excessive line broadening suppresses FMR signals below 9 K, they persist up to 70~K, indicating the presence of non-percolating ferromagnetic clusters well above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The temperature dependence of the FMR intensity follows that of the magnetization, underscoring the stability of these clusters. We quantitatively describe both FMR and SQUID observables using atomistic spin model operating on a common set of parameters. The level of agreement, achieved without tuning parameters between datasets, demonstrates the robustness and practical applicability of the approach in capturing the essential physics of spin-diluted, percolating ferromagnets. This study advances the understanding of percolating ferromagnetic systems, demonstrating that FMR is a key technique for probing their unique dynamic and anisotropic properties. Our findings contribute to the broader exploration of dilute ferromagnets and provide new insights into percolating ferromagnetic systems, which will be relevant for spintronic opportunities.</description>

      <title>Metastability and Ostwald Step Rule in the Crystallisation of Diamond and Graphite from Molten Carbon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crystallisation of carbon from the melt under extreme conditions is highly relevant to earth and planetary science, materials manufacturing, and nuclear fusion research. The thermodynamic conditions near the graphite-diamond-liquid (GDL) triple point are especially of interest for geological and technological applications, but high-pressure flash heating experiments aiming to resolve this region of the phase diagram of carbon exhibit large discrepancies. Experimental challenges are often related to the persistence of metastable crystalline or glassy phases, superheated crystals, or supercooled liquids. A deeper understanding of the crystallisation kinetics of diamond and graphite is crucial for effectively interpreting the outcomes of these experiments. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanisms of diamond and graphite nucleation from liquid carbon through molecular simulations with first-principles machine learning potentials. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental phase diagram of carbon in the region around the GDL triple point and show that liquid carbon crystallises spontaneously upon cooling at constant pressure. Surprisingly, metastable graphite crystallises in the domain of diamond thermodynamic stability at pressures above the triple point. Furthermore, whereas diamond crystallises through a classical nucleation pathway, graphite follows a two-step process in which low-density fluctuations forego ordering. Calculations of the nucleation rates of the two competing phases confirm this result and reveal a manifestation of Ostwald's step rule where the strong metastability of graphite hinders the transformation to the stable diamond phase. Our results provide a new key to interpreting melting and recrystallisation experiments and shed light on nucleation kinetics in polymorphic materials with deep metastable states.</description>

Abstract: For decades, there have been multiple seemingly contradicting experimental reports on the dependence of the photoluminescence from metal nanostructures on their size. We reconcile these reports using a simple analytic formula which is found to match well photoluminescence measurements for a range of structures and illumination conditions. Our expression requires only knowledge of the local electric field and temperature, and it points to the physical quantities that determine the emission strength and its dependence on size.</description>

      <title>Excitonic effects in phonons: reshaping the graphene Kohn anomalies and lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an ab initio framework that captures the impact of electron-electron and electron-hole interactions on phonon properties. This enables the inclusion of excitonic effects in the optical phonon dispersions and lifetimes of graphene, both near the center ($\Gamma$) and at the border (K) of the Brillouin zone, at phonon momenta relevant for Raman scattering and for the onset of the intrinsic electrical resistivity. Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} &lt; {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.</description>

      <title>Real Space Visualization of Order-Disorder Transition in BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity in BaTiO3 was observed nearly eighty years ago, but the mechanism underlying its ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition remains elusive. The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role, however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO3 across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into a order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along &lt;111&gt; direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the &lt;111&gt; polar Ti displacements. Our direct visualizations provides atomic insights into the order-disorder mechanism in the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition of BaTiO3.</description>

      <title>First-principles electron-phonon interactions with self-consistent Hubbard interaction: an application to transparent conductive oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ab initio computational method known as Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+$U$) captures well ground electronic structures of a set of solids that are poorly described by standard DFT alone. Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fr\"ohlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.</description>

      <title>A new generation of effective core potentials: Selected lanthanides and heavy elements II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.</description>

      <title>Auger parameter analysis for TiN and AlN thin films via combined in-situ XPS and HAXPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auger parameter analysis provides in-depth information about the electronic and chemical bonding properties of TiN and AlN thin films, which are relevant across a wide range of technologies. Meaningful interpretation and analysis of the Auger parameter of these materials have been hindered due to, among other reasons, the absence of reliable references. Here we present a comprehensive study of Auger parameters for TiN and AlN thin films using a dual-source lab-based XPS/HAXPES system equipped with Al Ka and Cr Ka x-ray sources. Due to a large spread of excitation x-ray energy, bulk- and surface-sensitive core-level photoelectrons and Auger transitions are probed. This allows us to study a wide range of Auger and core-level emission lines of TiN and AlN. These measurements can serve as references for further identification of chemical state changes, oxidation state or any deviations in the local chemical environment in these materials. UHV sample transfer was employed to minimise surface contamination. Additionally, we demonstrate how common procedures such as ambient air exposure and Ar+ sputter-etching influence the Auger parameters, highlighting the importance of surface preparation in spectroscopic analysis.</description>

      <title>Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled by high-intensity lasers. We investigated the near-infrared absorption of free-standing membranes of stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$), a candidate sail material. To resolve the small but non-zero optical loss, we used photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), for which we developed a self-referencing modality where a PCI measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with monolayer graphene deposited on the membrane. The graphene increases the absorption of the sample by orders of magnitude, such that it can be measured by ellipsometry, without significantly affecting the thermal properties. We measured the absorption coefficient of Si$_3$N$_4$ to be (1.5-3) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, making it a suitable sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^2$. By comparison, silicon-rich "low stress" SiN$_x$ (x~1), with a measured absorption coefficient of approximately 8 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities. Our self-referencing technique enables testing of low-loss membranes of various materials for laser sails and other applications.</description>

      <title>Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Revealing Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Berry curvature-related topological phenomena have been a central topic in condensed matter physics. Yet, until recently other quantum geometric quantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due to the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review gives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the nonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection with excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical processes. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into nonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena. Such a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of the underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the electron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift currents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their respective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these resonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity that shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the role of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents a window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state correlation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous motion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear transport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between quantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising probes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex materials.</description>
