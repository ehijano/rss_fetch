      <title>Science at Risk: The Urgent Need for Institutional Support of Long-Term Ecological and Evolutionary Research in an Era of Data Manipulation and Disinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet Earth and the biodiversity it supports are in crisis. Human impact on terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems and the hundreds of thousands of organisms that inhabit them is global. To what extent can we push ecosystems before they collapse? Will species adapt to these changes and at what rate? What are the consequences, for the environment and humankind? These are some of the most pressing issues to date. Clear answers can only be addressed through long-term research programs that are extremely complex in their deployment, and by the analyses of the unique data they produce on species and ecosystem responses to change. Yet, too little institutional support and consideration have been given to long-term ecological and evolutionary research.  We describe the action recently taken by the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) to recognize and support long-term ecological and evolutionary research. We provide some salient examples of critical knowledge attainable only through long-term studies in ecology and evolution, before highlighting how global institutional schemes can not only support long-term research, but lead to informed conservation efforts and societal change. Now more than ever, as populism grows and fuels mis-and dis-informed politics, governmental programs are urgently needed to support data collection, establish data-grounded facts, inform political spheres, and refuel trust with society at large.</description>

      <title>Widespread remote introgression in the grass genomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic transfers are pervasive across both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, encompassing canonical genomic introgression between species or genera and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) across kingdoms. However, DNA transfer between phylogenetically distant species, here defined as remote introgression (RI), has remained poorly explored in evolutionary genomics. In this study, we present RIFinder, a novel phylogeny-based method for RI event detection, and apply it to a comprehensive dataset of 122 grass genomes. Our analysis identifies 622 RI events originating from 543 distinct homologous genes, revealing distinct characteristics among grass subfamilies. Specifically, the subfamily Pooideae exhibits the highest number of introgressed genes while Bambusoideae contains the lowest. Comparisons among accepted genes, their donor copies and native homologs demonstrate that introgressed genes undergo post-transfer localized adaptation, with significant functional enrichment in stress-response pathways. Notably, we identify a large Triticeae-derived segment in a Chloridoideae species Cleistogenes songorica, which is potentially associated with its exceptional drought tolerance. Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence that RI has contributed to the origin and diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters of gramine, a defensive alkaloid chemical, across grass species. Collectively, our study establishes a robust method for RI detection and highlights its critical role in adaptive evolution.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary features in a minimal physical system: diversity, selection, growth, inheritance, and adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple physical model that recapitulates several features of biological evolution, while being based only on thermally-driven attachment and detachment of elementary building blocks. Through its dynamics, this model samples a large and diverse array of non-equilibrium steady states, both within and between independent trajectories. These dynamics exhibit directionality with a quantity that increases in time, selection and preferential spatial expansion of particular states, as well as inheritance in the form of correlated compositions between successive states, and environment-dependent adaptation. The model challenges common conceptions regarding the requirements for life-like properties: it does not involve separate mechanisms for metabolism, replication and compartmentalization, stores and transmits digital information without template replication or assembly of large molecules, exhibits selection both without and with reproduction, and undergoes growth without autocatalysis. As the model is based on generic physical principles, it is amenable to various experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Covariance Decomposition for Distance Based Species Tree Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In phylogenomics, species-tree methods must contend with two major sources of noise; stochastic gene-tree variation under the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) and finite-sequence substitutional noise. Fast agglomerative methods such as GLASS, STEAC, and METAL combine multi-locus information via distance-based clustering. We derive the exact covariance matrix of these pairwise distance estimates under a joint MSC-plus-substitution model and leverage it for reliable confidence estimation, and we algebraically decompose it into components attributable to coalescent variation versus sequence-level stochasticity. Our theory identifies parameter regimes where one source of variance greatly exceeds the other. For both very low and very high mutation rates, substitutional noise dominates, while coalescent variance is the primary contributor at intermediate mutation rates. Moreover, the interval over which coalescent variance dominates becomes narrower as the species-tree height increases. These results imply that in some settings one may legitimately ignore the weaker noise source when designing methods or collecting data. In particular, when gene-tree variance is dominant, adding more loci is most beneficial, while when substitution noise dominates, longer sequences or imputation are needed. Finally, leveraging the derived covariance matrix, we implement a Gaussian-sampling procedure to generate split support values for METAL trees and demonstrate empirically that this approach yields more reliable confidence estimates than traditional bootstrapping.</description>

      <title>IdentityByDescentDispersal.jl: Inferring dispersal rates with identity-by-descent blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The population density and per-generation dispersal rate of a population are central parameters in the study of evolution and ecology. The distribution of recent coalescent events between individuals in space can be used to estimate such quantities through the distribution of identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks. An IBD block is defined as a segment of DNA that has been inherited by a pair of individuals from a common ancestor without being broken by recombination. We introduce IdentityByDescentDispersal.jl, a Julia package for estimating effective population densities and dispersal rates from observed spatial patterns of IBD shared blocks. It implements the inference scheme proposed by Ringbauer, Coop, and Barton (2017). The package provides a user-friendly interface, supports efficient gradient-based optimization and accommodates arbitrary user-defined demographic models through numerical integration. This software aims to encourage a wider audience to utilize spatial genetic data for estimating dispersal rates, thereby motivating further research and expanding its applications.</description>
