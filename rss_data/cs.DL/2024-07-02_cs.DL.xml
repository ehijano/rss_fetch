      <title>Quantitative Methods in Research Evaluation Citation Indicators, Altmetrics, and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book critically analyses the value of citation data, altmetrics, and artificial intelligence to support the research evaluation of articles, scholars, departments, universities, countries, and funders. It introduces and discusses indicators that can support research evaluation and analyses their strengths and weaknesses as well as the generic strengths and weaknesses of the use of indicators for research assessment. The book includes evidence of the comparative value of citations and altmetrics in all broad academic fields primarily through comparisons against article level human expert judgements from the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021. It also discusses the potential applications of traditional artificial intelligence and large language models for research evaluation, with large scale evidence for the former. The book concludes that citation data can be informative and helpful in some research fields for some research evaluation purposes but that indicators are never accurate enough to be described as research quality measures. It also argues that AI may be helpful in limited circumstances for some types of research evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Document-based Knowledge Discovery with Microservices Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first step towards digitalization within organizations lies in digitization - the conversion of analog data into digitally stored data. This basic step is the prerequisite for all following activities like the digitalization of processes or the servitization of products or offerings. However, digitization itself often leads to 'data-rich' but 'knowledge-poor' material. Knowledge discovery and knowledge extraction as approaches try to increase the usefulness of digitized data. In this paper, we point out the key challenges in the context of knowledge discovery and present an approach to addressing these using a microservices architecture. Our solution led to a conceptual design focusing on keyword extraction, similarity calculation of documents, database queries in natural language, and programming language independent provision of the extracted information. In addition, the conceptual design provides referential design guidelines for integrating processes and applications for semi-automatic learning, editing, and visualization of ontologies. The concept also uses a microservices architecture to address non-functional requirements, such as scalability and resilience. The evaluation of the specified requirements is performed using a demonstrator that implements the concept. Furthermore, this modern approach is used in the German patent office in an extended version.</description>

      <title>We are Who We Cite: Bridges of Influence Between Natural Language Processing and Other Academic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is poised to substantially influence the world. However, significant progress comes hand-in-hand with substantial risks. Addressing them requires broad engagement with various fields of study. Yet, little empirical work examines the state of such engagement (past or current). In this paper, we quantify the degree of influence between 23 fields of study and NLP (on each other). We analyzed ~77k NLP papers, ~3.1m citations from NLP papers to other papers, and ~1.8m citations from other papers to NLP papers. We show that, unlike most fields, the cross-field engagement of NLP, measured by our proposed Citation Field Diversity Index (CFDI), has declined from 0.58 in 1980 to 0.31 in 2022 (an all-time low). In addition, we find that NLP has grown more insular -- citing increasingly more NLP papers and having fewer papers that act as bridges between fields. NLP citations are dominated by computer science; Less than 8% of NLP citations are to linguistics, and less than 3% are to math and psychology. These findings underscore NLP's urgent need to reflect on its engagement with various fields.</description>
