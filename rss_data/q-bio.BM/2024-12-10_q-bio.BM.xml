      <title>An RNA condensate model for the origin of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RNA World hypothesis predicts that self-replicating RNAs evolved before DNA genomes and coded proteins. Despite widespread support for the RNA World, self-replicating RNAs have yet to be identified in a natural context, leaving a key 'missing link' for this explanation of the origin of life. Inspired by recent work showing that condensates of charged polymers can create electrochemical gradients capable of catalyzing hydrolysis, we consider a catalytic RNA condensate as a candidate for the self-replicating RNA. We develop a theoretical framework where an RNA condensate formed by the spontaneous demixing of disordered RNA sequences undergoes self-replicative amplification. Our theory addresses two central problems in the origins of life: (i) the origin of compartmentalization and (ii) the error threshold for the accuracy of templated replication. We show that many of the needed properties of this self-replicating RNA condensate have been realized experimentally in recent studies and can be formalized within a standard polymer physics framework. Specifically, we propose that short, low-complexity RNA polymers formed catalytic condensates capable of templated RNA polymerization. Because the condensate properties depend on the RNA sequences, RNAs that formed condensates with improved polymerization and demixing capacity would be amplified, leading to a 'condensate chain reaction' and evolution by natural selection. We believe this prediction could be tested with current experimental and theoretical tools. Furthermore, we note that the extant nucleolus appears to satisfy many of the requirements of an evolutionary relic for the model we propose. More generally, we suggest that future work on the origin of life would benefit from condensate-centric biophysical models of RNA evolution.</description>

      <title>On Diffusion Posterior Sampling via Sequential Monte Carlo for Zero-Shot Scaffolding of Protein Motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, new proteins can be generated at an unprecedented rate. The \textit{motif scaffolding problem} requires steering this generative process to yield proteins with a desirable functional substructure -- a motif. While models have been trained to take the motif as conditional input, recent techniques in diffusion posterior sampling can be leveraged as zero-shot alternatives whose approximations can be corrected with sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. In this work, we introduce a new set of guidance potentials to describe and solve scaffolding tasks by adapting SMC-aided diffusion posterior samplers with an unconditional model, Genie, acting as a prior. Against established benchmarks, we successfully scaffold several single-motif and multi-motif problems. The latter is possible by pairing reconstruction guidance with $\mathrm{SE}(3)$-invariant potentials. In the single-motif case, we find these potentials perform comparably to the conventional masking approach and that reconstruction guidance outperforms replacement methods when aided with SMC. We additionally consider a guidance potential for point symmetry constraints and produce designable internally symmetric monomers with our setup. Overall, this work highlights the capabilities and areas for improvement of zero-shot posterior samplers in motif scaffolding tasks.

      <title>Protein Evolution as a Complex System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein evolution underpins life, and understanding its behavior as a system is of great importance. However, our current models of protein evolution are arguably too simplistic to allow quantitative interpretation and prediction of evolutionary trajectories. Viewing protein evolution as a complex system has the potential to advance our understanding and ability to model protein evolution. In this perspective, we discuss aspects of protein evolution that are typical of complex systems, from nonlinear dynamics, sensitivity to initial conditions, self-organization, and the emergence of order from chaos and disorder. We discuss how the growth in sequence and structural data, insights from laboratory evolution and new machine learning tools can advance the study of protein evolution and that by treating protein evolution as a complex adaptive system, we may gain new insights into the fundamental principles driving biological innovation and adaptation and apply this to protein engineering and design.</description>

      <title>In Silico Pharmacokinetic and Molecular Docking Studies of Natural Plants against Essential Protein KRAS for Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kind of pancreatic cancer called Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is anticipated to be one of the main causes of mortality during past years. Evidence from several researches supported the concept that the oncogenic KRAS (Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene) mutation is the major cause of pancreatic cancer. KRAS acts as an on-off switch that promotes cell growth. But when the KRAS gene is mutated, it will be in one position, allowing the cell growth uncontrollably. This uncontrollable multiplication of cells causes cancer growth. Therefore, KRAS was selected as the target protein in the study. Fifty plant-derived compounds are selected for the study. To determine whether the examined drugs could bind to the KRAS complex's binding pocket, molecular docking was performed. Computational analyses were used to assess the possible ability of tested substances to pass the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). To predict the bioactivity of ligands a machine learning model was created. Five machine learning models were created and have chosen the best one among them for analyzing the bioactivity of each ligand. From the fifty plant-derived compounds the compounds with the least binding energies are selected. Then bioactivity of these six compounds is analyzed using Random Forest Regression model. Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) properties of compounds are analyzed. The results showed that borneol has powerful effects and acts as a promising agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This suggests that borneol found in plants like mint, ginger, rosemary, etc., is a successful compound for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</description>

      <title>SMI-Editor: Edit-based SMILES Language Model with Fragment-level Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SMILES, a crucial textual representation of molecular structures, has garnered significant attention as a foundation for pre-trained language models (LMs). However, most existing pre-trained SMILES LMs focus solely on the single-token level supervision during pre-training, failing to fully leverage the substructural information of molecules. This limitation makes the pre-training task overly simplistic, preventing the models from capturing richer molecular semantic information. Moreover, during pre-training, these SMILES LMs only process corrupted SMILES inputs, never encountering any valid SMILES, which leads to a train-inference mismatch. To address these challenges, we propose SMI-Editor, a novel edit-based pre-trained SMILES LM. SMI-Editor disrupts substructures within a molecule at random and feeds the resulting SMILES back into the model, which then attempts to restore the original SMILES through an editing process. This approach not only introduces fragment-level training signals, but also enables the use of valid SMILES as inputs, allowing the model to learn how to reconstruct complete molecules from these incomplete structures. As a result, the model demonstrates improved scalability and an enhanced ability to capture fragment-level molecular information. Experimental results show that SMI-Editor achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream molecular tasks, and even outperforming several 3D molecular representation models.</description>

      <title>KITE-DDI: A Knowledge graph Integrated Transformer Model for accurately predicting Drug-Drug Interaction Events from Drug SMILES and Biomedical Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a common practice in modern medicine to prescribe multiple medications simultaneously to treat diseases. However, these medications could have adverse reactions between them, known as Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI), which have the potential to cause significant bodily injury and could even be fatal. Hence, it is essential to identify all the DDI events before prescribing multiple drugs to a patient. Most contemporary research for predicting DDI events relies on either information from Biomedical Knowledge graphs (KG) or drug SMILES, with very few managing to merge data from both to make predictions. While others use heuristic algorithms to extract features from SMILES and KGs, which are then fed into a Deep Learning framework to generate output. In this study, we propose a KG-integrated Transformer architecture to generate an end-to-end fully automated Machine Learning pipeline for predicting DDI events with high accuracy. The algorithm takes full-scale molecular SMILES sequences of a pair of drugs and a biomedical KG as input and predicts the interaction between the two drugs with high precision. The results show superior performance in two different benchmark datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art models especially when the test and training sets contain distinct sets of drug molecules. This demonstrates the strong generalization of the proposed model, indicating its potential for DDI event prediction for newly developed drugs. The model does not depend on heuristic models for generating embeddings and has a minimal number of hyperparameters, making it easy to use while demonstrating outstanding performance in low-data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Selective Enrichment of Full AAV Capsids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene therapies using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) have been developed to treat monogenic and acquired diseases but are currently the most expensive drugs due, in part, to high manufacturing costs. The cells producing rAAV generate substantial quantities of empty (50-90%) and partially filled capsids that must be removed prior to final formulation. The conventional separation processes are inefficient in removing empty and partially filled capsids, have low yield, scale poorly, time consuming and need additional purification steps. This article demonstrates one step separation of full capsids from a mixture of full, partially filled, and empty capsids, and other protein impurities using selective crystallization, a purification process, which is first time in protein purification and is performed without physically or chemically modifying the target component for the first time in the history of selective crystallization, and is highly-efficient, highly-scalable, and economical. Hanging-drop vapor diffusion experiments were used to scout crystallization conditions in which full and empty capsids crystallize, then to define conditions in which crystals of full, empty, or both full and empty capsids nucleate and grow. The experimental results for rAAV serotypes 5, 8, and 9 as exemplary vectors and scale-up results show that full capsids can be selectively crystallized and separated in one step from a mixture of full, partially filled, and empty capsids, and other proteins with full capsid enrichment of greater than 80%, approximately 20% higher, and yield of greater than 90%, approximately greater than 30% higher from the existing methods, keeping their biological activity intact, in a short period of time (less than 4 h), with approximately 87% reduction in processing time from the existing processing time and without the need of additional purification steps and in one round.</description>

      <title>PPFlow: Target-aware Peptide Design with Torsional Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Therapeutic peptides have proven to have great pharmaceutical value and potential in recent decades. However, methods of AI-assisted peptide drug discovery are not fully explored. To fill the gap, we propose a target-aware peptide design method called \textsc{PPFlow}, based on conditional flow matching on torus manifolds, to model the internal geometries of torsion angles for the peptide structure design. Besides, we establish a protein-peptide binding dataset named PPBench2024 to fill the void of massive data for the task of structure-based peptide drug design and to allow the training of deep learning methods. Extensive experiments show that PPFlow reaches state-of-the-art performance in tasks of peptide drug generation and optimization in comparison with baseline models, and can be generalized to other tasks including docking and side-chain packing.</description>

      <title>Fast Polypharmacy Side Effect Prediction Using Tensor Factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Adverse reactions from drug combinations are increasingly common, making their accurate prediction a crucial challenge in modern medicine. Laboratory-based identification of these reactions is insufficient due to the combinatorial nature of the problem. While many computational approaches have been proposed, tensor factorisation models have shown mixed results, necessitating a thorough investigation of their capabilities when properly optimized.
  Results: We demonstrate that tensor factorisation models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on polypharmacy side effect prediction, with our best model (SimplE) achieving median scores of 0.978 AUROC, 0.971 AUPRC, and 1.000 AP@50 across 963 side effects. Notably, this model reaches 98.3\% of its maximum performance after just two epochs of training (approximately 4 minutes), making it substantially faster than existing approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We also find that incorporating monopharmacy data as self-looping edges in the graph performs marginally better than using it to initialize embeddings.
  Availability and Implementation: All code used in the experiments is available in our GitHub repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10684402). The implementation was carried out using Python 3.8.12 with PyTorch 1.7.1, accelerated with CUDA 11.4 on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPUs.

      <title>EquiJump: Protein Dynamics Simulation via SO(3)-Equivariant Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mapping the conformational dynamics of proteins is crucial for elucidating their functional mechanisms. While Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation enables detailed time evolution of protein motion, its computational toll hinders its use in practice. To address this challenge, multiple deep learning models for reproducing and accelerating MD have been proposed drawing on transport-based generative methods. However, existing work focuses on generation through transport of samples from prior distributions, that can often be distant from the data manifold. The recently proposed framework of stochastic interpolants, instead, enables transport between arbitrary distribution endpoints. Building upon this work, we introduce EquiJump, a transferable SO(3)-equivariant model that bridges all-atom protein dynamics simulation time steps directly. Our approach unifies diverse sampling methods and is benchmarked against existing models on trajectory data of fast folding proteins. EquiJump achieves state-of-the-art results on dynamics simulation with a transferable model on all of the fast folding proteins.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Based Docking Methods: Fair Comparisons to Conventional Docking Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion learning method, DiffDock, for docking small-molecule ligands into protein binding sites was recently introduced. Results included comparisons to more conventional docking approaches, with DiffDock showing superior performance. Here, we employ a fully automatic workflow using the Surflex-Dock methods to generate a fair baseline for conventional docking approaches. Results were generated for the common and expected situation where a binding site location is known and also for the condition of an unknown binding site. For the known binding site condition, Surflex-Dock success rates at 2.0 Angstroms RMSD far exceeded those for DiffDock (Top-1/Top-5 success rates, respectively, were 68/81% compared with 45/51%). Glide performed with similar success rates (67/73%) to Surflex-Dock for the known binding site condition, and results for AutoDock Vina and Gnina followed this pattern. For the unknown binding site condition, using an automated method to identify multiple binding pockets, Surflex-Dock success rates again exceeded those of DiffDock, but by a somewhat lesser margin. DiffDock made use of roughly 17,000 co-crystal structures for learning (98% of PDBBind version 2020, pre-2019 structures) for a training set in order to predict on 363 test cases (2% of PDBBind 2020) from 2019 forward. DiffDock's performance was inextricably linked with the presence of near-neighbor cases of close to identical protein-ligand complexes in the training set for over half of the test set cases. DiffDock exhibited a 40 percentage point difference on near-neighbor cases (two-thirds of all test cases) compared with cases with no near-neighbor training case. DiffDock has apparently encoded a type of table-lookup during its learning process, rendering meaningful applications beyond its reach. Further, it does not perform even close to competitively with a competently run modern docking workflow.</description>
