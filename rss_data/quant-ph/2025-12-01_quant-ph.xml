      <title>Quantum Optimality in the Odd-Cycle game: the topological odd-blocker, marked connected components of the giant, consistency of pearls, vanishing homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize optimality of Quantum strategies for the Odd-Cycle game. Separate from other game-theoretic settings, parallel repetition for the Odd-Cycle game is related to the foam problem, which can be formulated through a minimization of the surface area. In comparison to previous works on minimizing the surface area, we quantify how properties of the marked giant connected component can be related to the maximum winning probability using Quantum strategies. Objects that we introduce to formulate such connections include the topological odd-blocker, previous examples of error bounds for other Quantum games that have been formulated by the author, pearls, consistent regions, and the cycle elimination problem.</description>

      <title>Higher-order nonclassicality criteria for photon-subtracted and photon-added states via the normalization constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any nonclassicality criterion based on factorial moments, including several higher-order parameters such as the Mandel $Q^{(\ell)}$ parameter, the Lee antibunching function $d^{(\ell-1)}_h$, and the Agarwal--Tara parameter $A_3$, can be computed straightforwardly for photon-subtracted and photon-added states by performing operator reordering of the factorial moments. Within this approach, all relevant quantities depend solely on the normalization constant of the given state.</description>

      <title>Testing Single Photon Entanglement using Self-Referential Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement does not always require one particle per party. It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality. Although initially debated, single-photon nonlocality was eventually demonstrated via homodyne measurements. Here, we present an alternate realisation that avoids the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes in their implementation. We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented. This offers a new perspective on single-photon nonlocality and a more accessible experimental route, potentially applicable to general mode-entangled states in diverse platforms.</description>

      <title>No need to calibrate: characterization and compilation for high-fidelity circuit execution using imperfect gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and validate on real quantum computing hardware a new method for extended two-qubit gate set design, replacing iterative, fine calibration with fast characterization of a small number of gate parameters which are then tracked and corrected in circuit compilation. Coherent contributions to the pulse unitary that would traditionally be considered sources of error are treated as part of the gate definition, and compensated in software via single-qubit rotations. This approach enables rapid device-wide generation of high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates, which are combined with standard calibrated gates to produce an expanded gate set. We show how these gates are directly usable as part of a quantum compiler, synthesizing generic two-qubit circuit blocks into minimal-duration sequences of the characterized gates interleaved with compensating single-qubit rotations. Benchmarking against circuits compiled using the default $CX$ gate alone on 127-qubit IBM hardware shows up to 7X improvement in success probability for Quantum Fourier Transform circuits up to 26 qubits, and up to 9X lower mean-square error in Trotter simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. Our hardware-agnostic characterization and compilation methodology makes it practical to scale up expressive gate sets on quantum computing architectures while minimizing the need for onerous fine-tuning of low-level control waveforms.</description>

      <title>Measure and Forget Dynamics in Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Forgetful" measurements-physically similar to dephasing-are of interest both for applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing and fundamentally, in studying how entanglement and entropy spread. This paper investigates measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in random Clifford circuits when measurement outcomes are partially forgotten. Our findings reveal a local thermalization rate that remains constant regardless of system size. We also numerically calculate the decay behavior at the turning points in the entropy diagram. We observe a counterintuitive phenomenon where the entropy reaches a threshold and stops evolving, even as the system size increases. This challenges an intuition, drawn from previous studies of noisy random circuits, that noise will cause the thermalization of the whole system. Additionally, we identify the disappearance of the purification transition and discuss the implications of these entanglement dynamics for quantum error-correction codes.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and resource advantages of quantum eigenvalue estimation with non-Hermitian transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In electronic structure calculations, the transcorrelated method enables a reduction of the basis set size by incorporating the electron-electron correlations directly into the Hamiltonian. However, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, which makes many common quantum algorithms inapplicable. Recently, a quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm was proposed for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra [FOCS 65, 1051 (2024)]. Here we investigate the cost of this algorithm applied to transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians of second-row atoms and compare it to the cost of applying standard qubitization to non-transcorrelated Hamiltonians. We find that the ground state energy of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian in the STO-6G basis is more accurate than that of a standard Hamiltonian in the cc-pVQZ basis. The T gate counts of the two methods are comparable, while the qubit count of the transcorrelated method is 2.5 times smaller.</description>

      <title>Lattice Surgery Aware Resource Analysis for the Mapping and Scheduling of Quantum Circuits for Scalable Modular Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing platforms are evolving to a point where placing high numbers of qubits into a single core comes with certain difficulties such as fidelity, crosstalk, and high power consumption of dense classical electronics. Utilizing distributed cores, each hosting logical data qubits and logical ancillas connected via classical and quantum communication channels, offers a promising alternative. However, building such a system for logical qubits requires additional optimizations, such as minimizing the amount of state transfer between cores for inter-core two-qubit gates and optimizing the routing of magic states distilled in a magic state factory. In this work, we investigate such a system and its statistics in terms of classical and quantum resources. First, we restrict our quantum gate set to a universal gate set consisting of CNOT, H, T, S, and Pauli gates. We then developed a framework that can take any quantum circuit, transpile it to our gate set using Qiskit, and then partition the qubits using the KaHIP graph partitioner to balanced partitions. Afterwards, we built an algorithm to map these graphs onto the 2D mesh of quantum cores by converting the problem into a Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) to minimize the routing of leftover two-qubit gates between cores and the total travel of magic states from the magic state factory. Following this stage, the gates are scheduled using an algorithm that takes care of the timing of the gate set. As a final stage, our framework reports detailed statistics such as the number of classical communications, the number of EPR pairs and magic states consumed, and timing overheads for pre- and post- processing for inter-core state transfers. These results help to quantify both classical and quantum resources that are used in distributed logical quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>A scalable advantage in multi-photon quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons are promising candidates for quantum information technology due to their high robustness and long coherence time at room temperature. Inspired by the prosperous development of photonic computing techniques, recent research has turned attention to performing quantum machine learning on photonic platforms. Although photons possess a high-dimensional quantum feature space suitable for computation, a general understanding of how to harness it for learning tasks remains blank. Here, we establish both theoretically and experimentally a scalable advantage in quantum machine learning with multi-photon states. Firstly, we prove that the learning capacity of linear optical circuits scales polynomially with the photon number, enabling generalization from smaller training datasets and yielding lower test loss values. Moreover, we experimentally corroborate these findings through unitary learning and metric learning tasks, by performing online training on a fully programmable photonic integrated platform. Our work highlights the potential of photonic quantum machine learning and paves the way for achieving quantum enhancement in practical machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of a $\sigma_z\sigma_x$ beam-splitter interaction between a Kerr-cat and transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires ancilla qubits to extract error syndromes from data qubits which store quantum information. However, ancilla errors can propagate back to the data qubits, introducing additional errors and limiting fault-tolerance. In superconducting quantum circuits, Kerr-cat qubits (KCQs), which exhibit strongly biased noise, have been proposed as ancillas to suppress this back-action and enhance QEC performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, realizing an effective $\sigma_z\sigma_x$ coupling that can be employed for parity measurements in QEC protocols. We characterize the interaction across a range of cat sizes and drive amplitudes, confirming the expected scaling of the interaction rate. These results establish a step towards hybrid architectures that combine transmons as data qubits with noise-biased bosonic ancillas, enabling hardware-efficient syndrome extraction and advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing using Geometrical Phase in Qubit-Oscillator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum sensing protocol for coupled qubit-oscillator systems that surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) by exploiting a geometrical phase. The signal is encoded in the geometrical phase that is proportional to the area enclosed in oscillator phase space. This area is amplified through squeezing, enabling sensitivities beyond the SQL. Our method is independent of oscillator's initial state, amenable to sensing with high-temperature or logical error-corrected states. The protocol shows robustness to qubit Markovian noise and preserves its state-independence, underscoring its practicality for next-generation quantum metrology. We demonstrate application to force sensing beyond the SQL in longitudinally coupled systems, and to high-precision measurements of couplings and pulse calibration surpassing SQL in dispersively coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Quantum Communication with a Two-Dimensional Perovskite Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D-OIHP) quantum wells are emerging as promising light sources for quantum communication technologies, owing to their ability to generate polarization-encoded optical signals. In this work, we explore how nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited for quantum information applications, demonstrating the versatility that arises from resonant coupling among excited states. By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences. While the polarizations of weak coherent pulses are typically manipulated with optical elements in traditional quantum key distribution approaches, the intrinsic electronic structure and spin relaxation processes within the 2D-OIHP system determine the characteristics of the signal photons in our method. As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells. These results show that the information transmission efficiency depends strongly on contributions from biexciton states, highlighting the potential of spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Switchable Dissipative Ising coupling Based on Three-Body Coupling in magnon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonic systems present a compelling platform for quantum technology, owing to their strong capacity to form hybrid quantum systems via diverse couplings. To unlock the full potential of these systems, the engineering of flexible coupling between multiple magnon modes is essential. Here, we propose a method to realize switchable dissipative Ising coupling in magnon systems, leveraging the three-body coupling among photon, phonon, and magnon. This type of dissipative coupling is a critical component for constructing Ising machines designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By dynamically tuning the phase of a nonlinear mechanical pump, we demonstrate the realization of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dissipative interactions. The validity of the scheme is confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrate its robustness against a strong uncontrollable part of dissipation. Our work provides a versatile tool that can facilitate the implementation of magnon-based quantum computing and the exploration of many-body magnon physics.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic pumping of topological corner states by coherent tunneling in a 2D SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active manipulation of topologically protected states represents a pivotal frontier for quantum technologies, offering a unique confluence of topological robustness and precise quantum control. We propose an adiabatic pumping scheme for the long-range transfer of topological corner states in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The protocol utilizes a modular lattice architecture composed of four topologically distinct subblocks, enabling the modulation of a topological dark state by precise tuning of lattice couplings. This approach is based on coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage among topological corner and interface states. We establish a multi-level model for the adiabatic pumping that provides an accurate description of the underlying mechanism. In comparison with a sequential two-stage Thouless pumping, our protocol offers superior performance in both transfer fidelity and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Propagation-Distance Limit for a Classical Nonlocal Optical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive closed-form analog quantum-speed-limit (QSL) bounds for highly nonlocal optical beams whose paraxial propagation is mapped to a reversed (inverted) harmonic-oscillator generator. Treating the longitudinal coordinate $z$ as an evolution parameter (propagation distance), we construct the propagator, evaluate the Bures distance, and obtain analytic Mandelstam--Tamm and Margolus--Levitin bounds that fix a propagation-distance limit $z_{\mathrm{PDL}}$ to reach a prescribed mode distinguishability. This distance-domain constraint is the classical optical analogue of the minimal orthogonality time in quantum mechanics. We then propose a compact self-defocusing PDL beam shaper that achieves strong transverse-mode conversion within millimeter scales. We further show that small variations in refractive index, beam power, or temperature shift $z_{\mathrm{SL}}$ with high leverage, enabling speed-limit-based metrology with index sensitivities down to $10^{-7}$ RIU and temperature resolutions of order $1$ mK. The results bridge distance-domain QSL geometry and practical photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Heterogeneous Quantum Federated Learning: Challenges and Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) combines quantum computing and federated learning to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy. QFL can improve computational efficiency and scalability by taking advantage of quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement. However, existing QFL frameworks largely focus on homogeneity among quantum \textcolor{black}{clients, and they do not account} for real-world variances in quantum data distributions, encoding techniques, hardware noise levels, and computational capacity. These differences can create instability during training, slow convergence, and reduce overall model performance. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth examination of heterogeneity in QFL, classifying it into two categories: data or system heterogeneity. Then we investigate the influence of heterogeneity on training convergence and model aggregation. We critically evaluate existing mitigation solutions, highlight their limitations, and give a case study that demonstrates the viability of tackling quantum heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss potential future research areas for constructing robust and scalable heterogeneous QFL frameworks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Ligand-like Molecules through Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization in Density Matrix Embedding Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.</description>

      <title>A Time-Symmetric Formulation of Quantum Measurement: Reinterpreting the Arrow of Time as Information Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a time-symmetric framework for quantum measurement that restores microscopic reversibility at the level of the dynamical description while remaining compatible with causality and thermodynamic consistency. Instead of invoking a stochastic wavefunction collapse, the measurement process is modeled as a bidirectional informational update between a forward-evolving state and a backward-propagating effect, governed by a completely positive generator and its adjoint. Within this operator-based formalism, pre- and post-selected statistics are treated on an equal footing, yielding a unified description of both. The proposed scheme rigorously preserves complete positivity, normalization, and the no-signalling principle, and it is shown to satisfy Spohn's inequality for the associated quantum Markov semigroup, thereby ensuring non-negative entropy production within this setting. The framework admits a direct experimental interpretation across a range of scenarios, including weak measurements, EPR-Bell tests, homodyne detection, and photon counting. Furthermore, in the classical limit, the bidirectional update is demonstrated to reduce to the well-established Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother used in classical estimation theory. These results support the view that the apparent temporal asymmetry of quantum measurement arises not from fundamental dynamical irreversibility, but from informational conditioning, specifically, the one-sided way in which measurement outcomes are incorporated into our description. In this sense, the arrow of time in measurement theory may be understood as an arrow of information.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Rydberg multi-qubit operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms can be decomposed into a universal set of elementary one- and two-qubit gates. Different physical implementations of quantum computing, however, employ interactions that permit direct conditional dynamics on multiple qubits in a single step. In this work, we leverage quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that implement multi-qubit controlled-phase, -NOT and -swap (Fredkin) gates on Rydberg atom quantum processors. The identification of robust multi-qubit operations leads to reduced operation time and less decoherence, and the control field provides continuous protection of the atoms from environmental noise. Notably, we find that the controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate, implemented using this approach achieves 99.74\% fidelity while accounting for imperfections such as spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing.</description>

      <title>Controlled-SWAP gates by tuning of interfering transition pathways in neutral atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum processors employ Rydberg blockade for multiqubit phase operations but lack similar native exchange and conditional exchange gates, which are essential primitives for state verification, fermionic and XY-model simulation, and efficient routing in large qubit arrays. We demonstrate that by lifting the degeneracy between interfering transition pathways, a single Rydberg-excited atom can control state exchange between pairs of atoms. Using this mechanism, we realize a direct controlled-SWAP (Fredkin) operation with more than 99\% fidelity and an order-of-magnitude reduction in circuit depth and reduced exposure to decay and decoherence of Rydberg state components compared with decomposed implementations. The mechanism operates robustly under Doppler broadening at ~150 $\mu$K and realistic laser-intensity noise and extends naturally to an entire family of useful gates, including multi-control conditional exchanges (C$_k$-SWAP) and conditional multiplexed SWAP gates. By incorporating controlled exchange operations as native physical operations on neutral atoms, our work provides multiqubit gates that enable higher-order state-verification protocols, occupation-dependent simulations, and conditional routing across optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing information retrieval in quantum-optical critical systems via quantum measurement backaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring of open quantum-optical systems offers a promising route towards quantum-enhanced estimation precision. In such continuous-measurement-based sensing protocols, the ultimate precision limit is dictated, through the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, by the global quantum Fisher information associated with the joint system-environment state. Reaching this limit with established continuous measurement techniques in quantum optics remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present a sensing protocol tailored for open quantum-optical sensors that exhibit dissipative criticality, enabling them to significantly narrow the gap to the ultimate precision limit. Our protocol leverages a previously unexplored interplay between the quantum criticality and the quantum measurement backaction inherent in continuous general-dyne detection. We identify a performance sweet spot, near which the ultimate precision limit can be efficiently approached. Our protocol establishes a new pathway towards quantum-enhanced precision in open quantum-optical setups and can be extended to other sensor designs featuring similar dissipative criticality.</description>

      <title>Local Equivalences of Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states form a large family of quantum states that are in one-to-one correspondence with mathematical graphs. Graph states are used in many applications, such as measurement-based quantum computation, as multipartite entangled resources. It is thus crucial to understand when two such states have the same entanglement, i.e. when they can be transformed into each other using only local operations. In this case, we say that the graph states are LU-equivalent (local unitary). If the local operations are restricted to the so-called Clifford group, we say that the graph states are LC-equivalent (local Clifford). Interestingly, a simple graph rule called local complementation fully captures LC-equivalence, in the sense that two graph states are LC-equivalent if and only if the underlying graphs are related by a sequence of local complementations. While it was once conjectured that two LU-equivalent graph states are always LC-equivalent, counterexamples do exist and local complementation fails to fully capture the entanglement of graph states. We introduce in this thesis a generalization of local complementation that does fully capture LU-equivalence. Using this characterization, we prove the existence of an infinite strict hierarchy of local equivalences between LC- and LU-equivalence. This also leads to the design of a quasi-polynomial algorithm for deciding whether two graph states are LU-equivalent, and to a proof that two LU-equivalent graph states are LC-equivalent if they are defined on at most 19 qubits. Furthermore, we study graph states that are universal in the sense that any smaller graph state, defined on any small enough set of qubits, can be induced using only local operations. We provide bounds and an optimal, probabilistic construction.</description>

      <title>Non-commutativity as a Universal Characterization for Enhanced Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum metrology is to effectively harness quantum resources to surpass classical precision bounds. Although recent studies suggest that the indefinite causal order may enable sensitivities to attain the super-Heisenberg scaling, the physical origins of such enhancements remain elusive. Here, we introduce the nilpotency index $\mathcal{K}$, which quantifies the depth of non-commutativity between operators during the encoding process, can act as a fundamental parameter governing quantum-enhanced sensing. We show that a finite $\mathcal{K}$ yields an enhanced scaling of root-mean-square error as $N^{-(1+\mathcal{K})}$. Meanwhile, the requirement for indefinite causal order arises only when the nested commutators become constant. Remarkably, in the limit $\mathcal{K} \to \infty$, exponential precision scaling $N^{-1}e^{-N}$ is achievable. We propose experimentally feasible protocols implementing these mechanisms, providing a systematic pathway towards practical quantum-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Programmable generation of arbitrary continuous-variable anharmonicities and nonlinear couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic oscillators are promising continuous-variable (CV) quantum resources because their infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces allow for resource-efficient quantum computing and simulation. To reach their full potential, CV platforms need to be able to efficiently implement non-Gaussian operations. However, schemes for generating arbitrary non-Gaussian operations are restricted to single modes, i.e., the implementation of anharmonic potentials. Here, we introduce a method for implementing arbitrary non-Gaussian operations applicable to both single- and multi-mode systems, allowing the generation of both anharmonicities and nonlinear multi-mode couplings. Our method synthesizes a target Hamiltonian by decomposing it into a Fourier series whose terms are implemented via bosonic quantum signal processing, which uses a discrete-variable (DV) system to induce a nonlinearity in the CV system. Our hybrid CV-DV protocol allows for the direct simulation of a broad range of CV phenomena (such as those in lattice gauge theory, chemical dynamics, and quantum chaos) and provides a richer toolbox for CV circuit compilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for translating fault-tolerant quantum circuits between their braiding and lattice surgery (LS) representations within the surface code. Our approach employs the ZX calculus to establish an equivalence between these two paradigms, enabling verified, bidirectional conversion of arbitrary surface-code-level circuits. We show that both braiding and LS operations can be uniformly expressed as compositions of multibody measurements and demonstrate that the Raussendorf compression rule encompasses all known braid and bridge optimizations. We also introduce a novel CNOT circuit with LS. Our framework provides a foundation for the automated verification, compilation, and benchmarking of large-scale surface code computations, advancing toward a unified formal language for topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>RELiQ: Scalable Entanglement Routing via Reinforcement Learning in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks are becoming increasingly important because of advancements in quantum computing and quantum sensing, such as recent developments in distributed quantum computing and federated quantum machine learning. Routing entanglement in quantum networks poses several fundamental as well as technical challenges, including the high dynamicity of quantum network links and the probabilistic nature of quantum operations. Consequently, designing hand-crafted heuristics is difficult and often leads to suboptimal performance, especially if global network topology information is unavailable.
  In this paper, we propose RELiQ, a reinforcement learning-based approach to entanglement routing that only relies on local information and iterative message exchange. Utilizing a graph neural network, RELiQ learns graph representations and avoids overfitting to specific network topologies - a prevalent issue for learning-based approaches. Our approach, trained on random graphs, consistently outperforms existing local information heuristics and learning-based approaches when applied to random and real-world topologies. When compared to global information heuristics, our method achieves similar or superior performance because of its rapid response to topology changes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to transform simulations of quantum many-body problems at the heart of electronic structure theory. Efficient quantum algorithms to compute the eigenstates of fermionic Hamiltonians, such as quantum phase estimation, rely critically on high-accuracy initial state preparation. While several state preparation algorithms have been proposed for fermionic ground states, the preparation of excited states remains a major challenge, limiting the applicability of quantum algorithms to photochemistry and photophysics. In this contribution, we describe a physically motivated adiabatic state preparation technique for low-lying excited states using the explicit coupling between electrons and photons. Our approach systematically converges to the first optically accessible excited state and can target different symmetry sectors by changing the photon polarization. We demonstrate the preparation of high-fidelity excited states for the Hubbard model and methylene molecule across a range of correlation regimes, and perform a successful hardware implementation for a model Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Superradiant decay in non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</description>

      <title>Unifying Collective Effects in Emission, Absorption, and Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective effects, such as superradiance and subradiance are central to emerging quantum technologies -- from sensing to energy storage -- and play an important role in light-harvesting. These effects enhance or suppress rates of dynamic processes (absorption, emission, and transfer) due to the formation of symmetric or antisymmetric collective states. However, collective effects in different contexts -- absorption, emission, and transfer -- have often been defined disparately, especially across different communities, leading to results that are not immediately transferable between different contexts. Here, we describe all three types of collective effects using a common Dicke framework that resolves the apparent discrepancies between different approaches. It allows us to generalise previously known collective effects involving spins into new ones involving aggregates of harmonic oscillators or other degrees of freedom. It also explains how collective effects can be engineered to be robust against both disorder and noise, paving the way for more resilient quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most quantum batteries studied so far with notable exception of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) batteries are based on integrable models, where superlinear scaling of charging power and hence a quantum advantage can be achieved, but at the cost of unstable stored energy due to integrability. Here, by considering the sunburst quantum Ising battery driven by periodic delta-kicks, we show that in the quantum chaotic regime a quantum advantage is achieved for number of batteries $n_b\leq 4$, together with excellent stability of energy storage. In the integrable regime optimal energy storage and extraction are possible irrespective of the initial state of the charger. Finally, we show that the observed advantage does not originate from multipartite entanglement within the battery subsystem and is therefore classical in nature.</description>

      <title>Quantum resource degradation theory within the framework of observational entropy decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum resource theories, traditional scalar measures often fail to capture the evolution of the quality of a resource under free operations. To address this limitation, we propose a quantum resource degradation theory based on the decomposition of observational entropy. We demonstrate that the total inconsistency measure, $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{C}}$, can be decomposed into two independent components: inter-block coherence, $\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$, and intra-block noise, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$. This decomposition reveals a significant degradation mechanism: under specific free operations, quantum coherence degrades into classical noise. Consequently, even when the total resource quantity is conserved, its quality decreases. This is quantified by the resource purity metric, $\eta$. Our theory provides greater detail than conventional approaches that rely solely on monotonicity. It also establishes a new framework for understanding quantum resource dynamics. We validate the theory through numerical experiments on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), demonstrating its utility in diagnosing and explaining the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP). The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for managing resource quality, complementing traditional resource quantification. This contributes to the optimization of quantum technologies on current and near-term noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Single Qubit Gates through Multi-Photon Transition Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main enablers in quantum computing is having qubit control that is precise and fast. However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Picostrain Sensing with Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum-enhanced picostrain sensor that achieves Heisenberg-limited strain sensing using superconducting qubits. A strain-sensitive qubit s Hamiltonian is coupled to the momentum quadrature of a microwave resonator, transducing mechanical strain $\epsilon$ into amplified spatial displacements of the resonator s phase space. Using homodyne detection of the resonator field and multipartite entanglement of N qubits, the protocol achieves a strain sensitivity $\Delta\epsilon \sim p\epsilon$ (picostrain), two orders of magnitude better than classical sensors. The scheme integrates natively with superconducting processors, enabling in-situ diagnostic and nanoscale material characterization.</description>

      <title>Entanglement gain in supercatalytic state transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalysis refers to the possibility of performing an otherwise impossible local state transformation by sharing an additional state, i.e. a catalyst, which is returned at the end of the protocol. There is a stronger version, known as supercatalysis, in which the borrowed catalyst is returned in an enhanced form, i.e. more entangled. However, this phenomenon has remained little explored. In this work we introduce the supercatalytic entanglement gain as a figure of merit taking values in [0,1] that quantifies the performance of the protocol (with 0 corresponding to the standard case of catalysis and 1 representing the maximal possible gain) and we study in which cases it can be greater than zero and which strategies can maximize it. While it turns out that every catalytic transformation can be implemented in a supercatalytic fashion with entanglement gain equal to 1 if the state that is borrowed is chosen appropriately, other choices can make the gain strictly less than 1 and even 0. In fact, we prove that a large class of catalytic transformations are not fully supercatalyzable, i.e. there is at least one choice of catalyst for which the entanglement gain vanishes. On the other hand, the construction that shows that supercatalysis is always possible with maximal gain uses artificially highly entangled catalysts. For this reason, we also study minimal supercatalysis, where the entanglement content of the borrowed state is constrained in a precise and natural way. While we consider a scenario where we prove it is impossible to have entanglement gain equal to 1 in this case, we show that there exist minimal supercatalytic transformations with gain as close to 1 as desired. We also explore several examples and observe that, although choosing a catalyst with the least possible entanglement is often an optimal strategy for minimal supercatalysis, this is not necessarily always the case.</description>

Abstract: Berry monopoles always cancel when summing over a complete set of energy eigenstates. We demonstrate that analogous sum rules exist for geometric phases and their underlying 2-forms in non-adiabatic evolution. Our result has implications for qudit computation as it limits the types of gates that can be implemented by purely geometric means.</description>

      <title>Effect of Energy Extensivity on the Performance of Open Quantum Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the performance of a quantum interferometer coupled to an external environment is a problem of conceptual and practical importance. If we consider a quantum interferometer featuring Heisenberg-limited sensitivity, then a typical result is that introducing coupling with the environment degrades the sensitivity to the shot-noise limit. Here we argue that this result crucially depends on whether the interferometer-environment coupling term is subject (or not) to the so-called Kac rescaling that restores extensivity, i.e., whether the coupling Hamiltonian is extensive or not. We present results of the Lindblad equation in the presence and absence of Kac rescaling of the coupling constant. Our results show that for a linear coupling and a harmonic model of the environment, often used in modeling of a quantum interferometer coupled with an environment, the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity may be restored after the Kac rescaling. This result points out the need and the importance to characterize the (model of the) environment of the interferometer at hand.</description>

Abstract: In a recent work [B. J. P. Jones and J. A. Formaggio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 111801 (2025)], the possibility of superradiant neutrino emission from atomic condensates has been theoretically proposed. Subsequent analysis by Y. K. Lu, H. Lin, and W. Ketterle [arXiv:2510.21705] questioned this scenario, emphasizing the limiting role of the fermionic nature of the decayed atoms. In this study, we revisit the problem and discuss under which conditions collective emission phenomena might still emerge in cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Computation and Verification of Spectra for Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between quantum mechanics and computation, revealing fundamental limitations for algorithms computing spectra, especially in non-Hermitian settings. Introducing the concept of locally trivial pseudospectra (LTP), we show such assumptions are necessary for spectral computation. LTP adapts dynamically to system energies, enabling spectral analysis across a broad class of challenging non-Hermitian problems. Exploiting this framework, we overcome a longstanding obstacle by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the imaginary cubic oscillator $H_{\mathrm{B}} = p^2 + i x^3$ with error bounds and no spurious modes -- yielding, to our knowledge, the first such error-controlled result. We confirm, for instance, the 100th eigenvalue as $627.6947122484365113526737029011536\ldots$. Here, truncation-induced $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking causes spurious eigenvalues -- a pitfall our method avoids, highlighting the link between truncation and physics. Finally, we illustrate the approach's generality via spectral computations for a range of physically relevant operators. This letter provides a rigorous framework linking computational theory to quantum mechanics and offers a precise tool for spectral calculations with error bounds.</description>

      <title>Improved parameter initialization for the (local) unitary cluster Jastrow ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz and its variant known as local UCJ (LUCJ) are promising choices for variational quantum algorithms for chemistry due to their combination of physical motivation and hardware efficiency. The parameters of these ansatzes can be initialized from the output of a coupled cluster, singles and doubles (CCSD) calculation performed on a classical computer. However, truncating the number of repetitions of the ansatz, as well as discarding interactions to accommodate the connectivity constraints of near-term quantum processors, degrade the approximation to CCSD and the resulting energy accuracy. In this work, we propose two methods to improve the parameter initialization. The first method, which is applicable to both expectation value- and sample-based algorithms, uses compressed double factorization of the CCSD amplitudes to improve or recover the CCSD approximation. The second method, which is applicable to sample-based algorithms, uses approximate tensor network simulation to improve the quality of samples produced by the ansatz circuit. We validate our methods using exact state vector simulation on systems of up to 52 qubits, as well as experiments on superconducting quantum processors using up to 65 qubits. Our results indicate that our methods can significantly improve the output of both expectation value- and sample-based quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Radio-Frequency Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference with Conditionally Built States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental demonstration of room-temperature Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference at a radio-wave frequency of 120 MHz using conditional build-up of quantum states from classical phase-averaged coherent states. This approach enables observation of quantum effects in spectral regimes where conventional single-photon sources and detectors are unavailable or require cryogenic conditions. By constructing a high-fidelity approximation of a single-photon state with phase-averaged coherent states, we observe the normalized second-order intensity correlation dips significantly below the classical limit of 0.5. The method allows for tunable noise suppression via optimization of the state representation. Our results establish the feasibility of using conditionally prepared classical states to simulate quantum interference phenomena in the radio-frequency domain. This technique opens the door to realizing other quantum protocols, such as Bell inequality tests, in frequency ranges where standard quantum technologies are currently infeasible.</description>

      <title>Wavelength dependent electrical readout of spin ensembles in thin-film silicon carbide on insulator platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report electrical spin state readout and coherent control of a small ensemble (&lt;450) of silicon vacancies in a silicon carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) platform, with excitation wavelengths from 780 to 990 nm. Demonstrating for the first time spin state readout well beyond the zero phonon line of the V2 silicon vacancies. By implementing photoelectrical detection of magnetic resonance (PDMR) in thin-film SiCOI, we merge a scalable and optics-free spin readout technique together with a promising platform for scalable and CMOS-compatible integrated photonics. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of optical and electrical readout between bulk SiC and thin-film SiCOI, revealing that our thin-film processing has no significant effect on the bulk T2 time of ~ 7 microseconds. These results establish SiCOI as a versatile platform for not only integrated photonics but also electronic and spin-based devices for scalable quantum technologies over a wide range of excitation wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Measurements with respect to the Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fidelity is the standard measure for quantifying the similarity between two quantum states. It is equal to the square of the minimum Bhattacharyya coefficient between the probability distributions induced by quantum measurements on the two states. Though established for over thirty years, the structure of fidelity-optimal quantum measurements remains unclear when the two density operators are singular (not invertible). Here we address this gap, with a focus on minimal optimal measurements, which admit no nontrivial coarse graining that is still optimal. We show that there exists either a unique minimal optimal measurement or infinitely many inequivalent choices. Moreover, the first case holds if and only if the two density operators satisfy a weak commutativity condition. In addition, we provide a complete characterization of all minimal optimal measurements when one state is pure, leveraging geometric insights from the Bloch-sphere representation. The connections with quantum incompatibility, operator pencils, and geometric means are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Replica Field Theory of Quantum Jumps Monitoring: Application to the Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we derive the replica field theory for monitored quantum many-body systems evolving under the quantum jumps protocol, corresponding to a non-Hermitian evolution interspersed with random quantum jumps whose distribution is state-dependent. We show that the density matrix of $R$ replicas evolves according to a master equation where the non-Hermitian term is replica-diagonal while coupling among replicas are due to quantum jumps. We write down the associated Keldysh action and study its behavior for the specific case of the Ising Chain with monitoring of particle density and tunable anisotropy, interpolating between free fermions with strong U(1) symmetry and the Ising chain with Z$_2$ symmetry. We derive the effective field theory in terms of slowly varying fields and obtain the replica-diagonal saddle point, which we show to describe the average state. We then go beyond saddle point and derive the effective field theory describing the replica off-diagonal sector, which takes the form of a Non-Linear Sigma Model. The symmetry class is either DIII or D, depending on the parameters of the Ising chain, except at a special symmetric point, where we recover the results for free fermions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the entangling phase observed numerically for the monitored Ising chain.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Fidelity Estimation with Common Randomized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient fidelity estimation of multiqubit quantum states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. However, to estimate the infidelity $\epsilon$ with multiplicative precision, conventional estimation protocols require (order) $1/\epsilon^2$ different circuits in addition to $1/\epsilon^2$ samples, which is quite resource-intensive for high-precision fidelity estimation. Here we introduce an efficient estimation protocol by virtue of common randomized measurements (CRM) integrated with shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, which only requires $1/\epsilon $ circuits. Moreover, in many scenarios of practical interest, in the presence of depolarizing or Pauli noise for example, our protocol only requires a constant number of circuits, irrespective of the infidelity $\epsilon$ and the qubit number. For large and intermediate quantum systems, quite often one circuit is already sufficient. In the course of study, we clarify the performance of CRM shadow estimation based on the Clifford group and 4-designs and highlight its advantages over standard and thrifty shadow estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure states are usually used to observe quantum phenomena. In this study, we show that a quantum superposition of spatially displaced mixed cat states can be generated within an optical waveguide via nonparaxial unitary evolution of the initial low coherence (low purity) light beam. It is shown that highly mixed Schrodinger cat states can be observed at a well-defined propagation distance. The importance of the long-term decoherence and recoherence of the original wave packet in observing the mixed cat states is demonstrated. The Heisenberg and Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty relations for mixed cat states are evaluated. We have demonstrated the feasibility of our method using accurate numerical simulations for the parameters of the source and optical waveguide available in practice.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Equivalence Checking: A Tractable Bridge From Unitary to Hybrid Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivalence checking of hybrid quantum circuits is of primary importance, given that quantum circuit transformations are omnipresent along the quantum compiler chain. While some approaches exist for automating this task, most focus on the simple case of unitary circuits. At the same time, real quantum computing requires hybrid circuits equipped with measurement operators. Moreover, the few approaches targeting the hybrid case are limited to a restricted class of problems. We propose tackling the Quantum Hybrid Circuit Equivalence Checking problem through lifting unitary circuit verification using a transformation known as deferred measurement. We show that this approach alone significantly outperforms prior work, and that, with the addition of specific unitary-level techniques we call separation and projection, it can handle much larger classes of hybrid circuit equivalence problems. We have implemented and evaluated our method over standard circuit transformations such as teleportation, one-way measurement, or the IBM Qiskit compiler, demonstrating its promises. As a side finding, we have identified and reported several unexpected behaviours with the Qiskit compiler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell inequalities limit the possible observations of non-communicating parties. Here, we present analogous inequalities for any number of communicating parties under the causal constraints of static causal order, definite causal order, and bi-causal order. All derived inequalities are remarkably simple. They correspond to upper bounds on the winning chance in graphical games: Given a specific directed graph over the parties, the parties are challenged to communicate along a randomly chosen arc. In the case of definite causal order, every game that we find is specified by a kefalopoda digraph. Based on this we define weakly causal correlations as those that satisfy all kefalopoda inequalities. We show that the problem of deciding whether some correlations are weakly causal is solvable in polynomial time in the number of parties.</description>

      <title>Tunable and nonlinearity-enhanced dispersive-plus-dissipative coupling in photon-pressure circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-pressure circuits are the circuit implementation of the cavity optomechanical Hamiltonian and discussed for qubit readout, low-frequency quantum photonics and dark matter axion detection. Due to the enormous design flexibility of superconducting circuits, photon-pressure systems provide fascinating possibilities to explore unusual parameter regimes of the optomechanical Hamiltonian. Here, we report the realization of a photon-pressure platform, in which a GHz circuit interacts with a MHz circuit via a magnetic-flux-tunable combination of dispersive and dissipative photon-pressure. In addition, both coupling rates are considerably enhanced by nonlinearities of the GHz-mode, which leads to the multi-photon coupling rates scaling stronger with the pump photon number $n_\mathrm{c}$ than the usual $\sqrt{n_\mathrm{c}}$ dependence. We demonstrate that interference of the two interaction paths leads to a Fano-like response in photon-pressure induced transparency, and that the dynamical backaction is considerably modified compared to the dispersive case, including a parametric instability caused by a red-detuned pump tone.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Qubit Gates Robust to Parameter Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art single-qubit gates on superconducting transmon qubits can achieve the fidelities required for error-corrected computations. However, parameter fluctuations due to qubit instabilities, environmental changes, and control inaccuracies make it difficult to maintain this performance. To mitigate the effects of these parameter variations, we numerically derive gates robust to amplitude and frequency errors using gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE). We analyze how fluctuations in qubit frequency, drive amplitude, and coherence affect gate performance over time. The robust pulses suppress coherent errors from drive amplitude drifts over 15 times more than a Gaussian pulse with derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) corrections. Furthermore, the robust gates, originally designed to compensate for quasi-static errors, also demonstrate resilience to stochastic, time-dependent noise, which is reflected in the dephasing time. They suppress added errors during increases in dephasing by up to 1.7 times more than DRAG.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Framework for Constructing Lie-Algebra Generator Pools: Application to Variational Quantum Eigensolvers for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22593v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie Algebras are powerful mathematical structures used in physics to describe sets of operators and associated combinations. A central task is to identify a minimal set of generators from which the algebra can be constructed. The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits. The presented mathematical framework is general and applicable well beyond chemistry in fields including quantum error correction, quantum control, quantum machine learning, and more universally wherever compact Pauli basis are required.</description>

      <title>High-yield engineering of modified divacancies in 4H-SiC via oxygen-ion implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified divacancies in the 4H polytype of silicon carbide (SiC) exhibit enhanced charge stability and spin addressability at room temperature, making them highly attractive for quantum applications. However, their low formation yield, both at the single-defect and ensemble levels, has limited further progress. Here, we demonstrate a controllable and efficient method for generating modified divacancy color centers in 4H-SiC via oxygen-ion implantation. Based on their distinct optical signatures and spin-resonance characteristics, we experimentally resolve four types of modified divacancies. Remarkably, single modified divacancies constitute above 90% of the total defect population and exhibit superior optical properties and spin coherence compared with defects created through conventional carbon- or nitrogen-ion implantation. We characterize the zero-phonon lines of these modified divacancies and reveal a distinct temperature-dependent behavior in the spin-readout contrast. By systematically optimizing the implantation dose and annealing temperature, we further achieve high-density ensembles and observe clear Rabi-oscillation beating patterns associated with different orientations of basal-type defects. These results establish oxygen-ion implantation as a powerful and versatile approach to engineering high-quality spin-active defects in SiC, representing a significant advance toward scalable solid-state quantum technologies. Furthermore, our findings provide key insights into the atomic configurations of modified divacancies in 4H-SiC.</description>

      <title>Recursive Clifford noise reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clifford noise reduction (CliNR) is a partial error correction scheme that reduces the logical error rate of Clifford circuits at the cost of a modest qubit and gate overhead. The CliNR implementation of an $n$-qubit Clifford circuit of size $s$ achieves a vanishing logical error rate if $snp^2\rightarrow 0$ where $p$ is the physical error rate. Here, we propose a recursive version of CliNR that can reduce errors on larger circuits with a relatively small gate overhead. When $np \rightarrow 0$, the logical error rate can be vanishingly small. This implementation requires $\left(2\left\lceil \log(sp)\right\rceil+3\right)n+1$ qubits and at most $24 s \left\lceil(sp)^4\right\rceil $ gates. Using numerical simulations, we show that the recursive method can offer an advantage in a realistic near-term parameter regime. When circuit sizes are large enough, recursive CliNR can reach a lower logical error rate than the original CliNR with the same gate overhead. The results offer promise for reducing logical errors in large Clifford circuits with relatively small overheads.</description>

      <title>A reconciliation of the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina statistics for semi-classical simulations of annihilation photons correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two photons from the ground state para-positronium annihilation are emitted in a maximally entangled singlet state of orthogonal polarizations. In case of the Compton scattering of both photons the phenomenon of quantum entanglement leads to a measurable increase in the azimuthal correlations of scattered photons, as opposed to a classical description treating the two scattering events as independent. The probability of the scattering of the system of the entangled photons is described by the Pryce-Ward cross section dependent on a difference of the azimuthal scattering angles in the fixed coordinate frame, while the independent scattering of single photons is described by the Klein-Nishina cross section dependent on the azimuthal angle relative to each photon's initial polarization. Since the singlet state of orthogonal polarizations is rotationally invariant, it does not carry any physical information on the initial polarizations of the single annihilation photons. In such bipartite state the angular origin for the Klein-Nishina cross section is undefined, making the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina descriptions mutually exclusive. However, semi-classical simulations of the joint Compton scattering of entangled photons - implementing the Pryce-Ward cross section, but still treating the two photons as separate entities - can reconcile the Pryce-Ward correlations with the Klein-Nishina statistics for single photons by implementing a modified version of a scattering cross section presented in this work.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Time-Order Correlator Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) are central probes of quantum scrambling, and their generalizations have recently become key primitives for both benchmarking quantum advantage and learning the structure of Hamiltonians. Yet their behavior has lacked a unified algorithmic interpretation. We show that higher-order OTOCs naturally fit within the framework of quantum signal processing (QSP): each $\mathrm{OTOC}^{(k)}$ measures the $2k$-th Fourier component of the phase distribution associated with the singular values of a spatially resolved truncated propagator. This explains the contrasting sensitivities of time-ordered correlators (TOCs) and higher-order OTOCs to causal-cone structure and to chaotic, integrable, or localized dynamics. Based on this understanding, we further generalize higher-order OTOCs by polynomial transformation of the singular values of the spatially resolved truncated propagator. The resultant signal allows us to construct frequency-selective filters, which we call \emph{OTOC spectroscopy}. This extends conventional OTOCs into a mode-resolved tool for probing scrambling and spectral structure of quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Quantum Granular Computing with Effect-Based Granules, Algebraic Properties and Reference Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the foundations of Quantum Granular Computing (QGC), extending classical granular computing including fuzzy, rough, and shadowed granules to the quantum regime. Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>OPI x Soft Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a particularly interesting line of research has focused on designing quantum algorithms for code and lattice problems inspired by Regev's reduction. The core idea is to use a decoder for a given code to find short codewords in its dual. For example, Jordan et al. demonstrated how structured codes can be used in this framework to exhibit some quantum advantage. In particular, they showed how the classical decodability of Reed-Solomon codes can be leveraged to solve the Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) problem quantumly. This approach was further improved by Chailloux and Tillich using stronger soft decoders, though their analysis was restricted to a specific setting of OPI. In this work, we reconcile these two approaches. We build on a recent formulation of the reduction by Chailloux and Hermouet in the lattice-based setting, which we rewrite in the language of codes. With this reduction, we show that the results of Jordan et al. can be recovered under Bernoulli noise models, simplifying the analysis. This characterization then allows us to integrate the stronger soft decoders of Chailloux and Tillich into the OPI framework, yielding improved algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum architecture search using multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design of parameterized quantum circuits for variational quantum algorithms. The framework finds a well-suited problem-specific structure of a variational ansatz. Among possible implementations of QAS the reinforcement learning (RL) stands out as one of the most promising. Current RL approaches are single-agent-based and show poor scalability with a number of qubits due to the increase of the action space dimension and the computational cost. We propose a novel multi-agent RL algorithm for QAS with each agent acting separately on its own block of a quantum circuit. This procedure allows to significantly accelerate the convergence of the RL-based QAS and reduce its computational cost. We benchmark the proposed algorithm on MaxCut problem on 3-regular graphs and on ground energy estimation for the Schwinger Hamiltonian. In addition, the proposed multi-agent approach naturally fits into the set-up of distributed quantum computing, favoring its implementation on modern intermediate scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Qubit Reuse Beyond Reorder and Reset: Optimizing Quantum Circuits by Fully Utilizing the Potential of Dynamic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit reuse offers a promising way to reduce the hardware demands of quantum circuits, but current approaches are largely restricted to reordering measurements and applying qubit resets. In this work, we present an approach to further optimize quantum circuits by fully utilizing the potential of dynamic quantum circuits-more precisely by moving measurements and introducing dynamic circuit primitives such as classically controlled gates in a way that forges entirely new pathways for qubit reuse. This significantly reduces the number of required qubits for a variety of circuits, creating new opportunities for running complex circuits on near-term devices with limited qubit counts. We show that the proposed approach drastically outperforms existing methods, reducing qubit requirements where previous approaches are unable to do so for popular quantum circuits such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Fourier Transform~(QFT), and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ans\"atze, as well as leading to improvements of up to 95% for sparse random circuits.</description>

      <title>Raising the Cavity Frequency in cQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic element of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is a cavity resonator strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit. Since the inception of the field, the choice of the cavity frequency was, with a few exceptions, been limited to a narrow range around 7 GHz due to a variety of fundamental and practical considerations. Here we report the first cQED implementation, where the qubit remains a regular transmon at about 5 GHz frequency, but the cavity's fundamental mode raises to 21 GHz. We demonstrate that (i) the dispersive shift remains in the conventional MHz range despite the large qubit-cavity detuning, (ii) the quantum efficiency of the qubit readout reaches 8%, (iii) the qubit's energy relaxation quality factor exceeds $10^7$, (iv) the qubit coherence time reproducibly exceeds $100~\mu\rm{s}$ and can reach above $300~\mu\rm{s}$ with a single echoing $\pi$-pulse correction. The readout error is currently limited by an accidental resonant excitation of a non-computational state, the elimination of which requires minor adjustments to the device parameters. Nevertheless, we were able to initialize the qubit in a repeated measurement by post-selection with $2\times 10^{-3}$ error and achieve $4\times 10^{-3}$ state assignment error. These results encourage in-depth explorations of potentially transformative advantages of high-frequency cavities without compromising existing qubit functionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer significant advancements in information processing and communication, notably in the domain of random number generation (RNG). The use of Bell inequalities enables users to certify the randomness of outputs produced by untrusted quantum RNG devices. We present a method for quantitatively analyzing Bell expressions used to certify randomness in quantum systems. Using this method, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on more than half a million Bell expressions involving configurations with four measurement settings for one party and three for the other. We identified five notable examples based on entropy scores under varying levels of white noise. As an extension of these results, we further incorporate the concept of self-testing for boxes (Banacki et al 2022, New J. Phys. 24 083003), enabling a more comprehensive characterization of quantum correlations through the evaluation of $Boxes(\alpha, B)$ and the corresponding measure $Flex(\alpha, B)$.</description>

      <title>Delayed Choice Quantum Erasure Experiment Revisited: Causality and Informational Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an operationally well-defined delayed-choice quantum-erasure experiment that realizes, for the first time, a genuine delayed choice within presently available quantum-optical technology. A multimode quantum memory supplies a controlled and verifiable delay, ensuring that the choice operation is applied strictly after the observation event. Electronic single-photon interference detection measurements then furnish a direct statistical discriminator between the causal and informational coherence hypotheses, based solely on marginal detection statistics and without any post-selection. The Poissonian structure of the detection statistics allows accumulation of statistics across repeated operational units, rendering the proposal practical and experimentally feasible.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal transmission in a cavity-magnon system by rotational Sagnac effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Single-Photon Transport in a Multi-mode Waveguide via a $\Lambda$-Type Emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of photon transport in waveguide quantum electrodynamics is fundamental to advancing quantum information processing. We investigate the manipulation of single-photon scattering via a driven $\Lambda$-type emitter coupled to a rectangular waveguide, examining both single- and multi-mode regimes. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism, we derive the scattering matrix and identify two distinct control mechanisms: Fano resonances induce complete reflection, and electromagnetically induce transparency (EIT) induce perfect transmission. In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics. When the input photon is prepared in a specific coherent superposition, multi-mode effects restore single-mode-like behavior, enabling Fano-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input prevents complete reflection even at the Fano resonance, while EIT-driven transmission persists. These results demonstrate a versatile toolbox for photonic quantum control in multi-mode waveguides, paving the way for applications such as broadband dual-frequency filters and multi-mode spectrometers.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robustness for Delegated Quantum Computation in the Circuit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based quantum computing, coupled with the rapid progress in quantum algorithms, brings to the forefront the question of verifiability in delegated quantum computations. In the current landscape of noisy quantum devices, this question must be addressed alongside noise tolerance. In this work, we revisit the circuit-based framework for verifiable quantum computation introduced by Broadbent [Theory of Computing, 2018], and extend it to the setting of server-side noise. Our contribution is an improved upper bound on the noise-tolerance threshold, achieved through a protocol that interleaves computation and test rounds in an indistinguishable manner. This structure enables a concise security proof against arbitrary deviations by the server, while ensuring robustness to realistic noise.</description>

      <title>Escaping Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Algorithms Using Negative Learning Rate in Quantum Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are becoming the primary computational primitive for next-generation quantum computers, particularly those embedded as resource-constrained accelerators in the emerging Quantum Internet of Things (QIoT). However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Wave-Particle Complementarity as the Optimal Limit of Unambiguous Quantum-State Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a direct operational interpretation of wave-particle complementarity in induced-coherence interferometry by linking interference visibility to the optimal performance of unambiguous quantum-state discrimination. In the low-gain Zou-Wang-Mandel interferometer, the idler modes of the two SPDC crystals act as nonorthogonal which-crystal marker states, and we show that the single-photon visibility equals the minimal inconclusive probability of the optimal Ivanovic-Dieks-Peres (IDP) strategy, V = P_I^{opt}, so that the complementarity relation D^{2} + V^{2} = 1 expresses a measurement-optimality boundary rather than a geometric constraint. Our results reveal that wave-particle duality in induced coherence is not limited by interferometer geometry but by measurement optimality in zero-error discrimination on the idler, with experimentally testable consequences predicting distinguishability beyond that inferred from visibility alone. In the presence of thermal noise we derive the hierarchy V &lt;= F(rho_A, rho_B) &lt;= P_I^{opt}, linking visibility, fidelity, and optimal discrimination. These results identify distinguishability as fundamentally measurement-limited and motivate discrimination-enhanced induced-coherence imaging and sensing.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Quantum Simulations of Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum phases-of-matter at finite-temperature is essential for understanding complex materials and large-scale thermodynamic phenomena. Here, we develop algorithmic protocols for simulating quantum thermodynamics on quantum hardware through quantum kernel function expansion (QKFE), producing the free energy as an analytic function of temperature with uniform convergence. These protocols are demonstrated by simulating transverse field Ising and XY models with superconducting qubits. In both analogue and digital implementations of the QKFE algorithms, we exhibit quantitative agreement of our quantum simulation experiments with the exact results. Our approach provides a general framework for computing thermodynamic potentials on programmable quantum devices, granting access to key thermodynamic properties such as entropy, heat capacity and criticality, with far-reaching implications for material design and drug development.</description>

      <title>CO-QLink: Cryogenic Optical Link for Scalable Quantum Computing Systems and High-Performance Cryogenic Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic systems necessitate extensive data transmission between room-temperature and cryogenic environments, as well as within the cryogenic temperature domain. High-speed, low-power data transmission is pivotal to enabling the deployment of larger-scale cryogenic systems, including the scalable quantum computing systems and the high-performance cryogenic computing systems fully immersed in liquid nitrogen. In contrast to wireline and microwave links, optical communication links are emerging as a solution characterized by high data rates, high energy efficiency, low signal attenuation, absence of thermal conduction, and superior scalability. In this work, a 4K heat-insulated high-speed (56Gbps) low-power (1.6pJ/b) transceiver (TRX) that achieves a complete link between 4K systems and room temperature (RT) equipment is presented. Copackaged with a PIN photodiode (PD), the RX uses an inverter-based analog front-end and an analog half-rate clock data recovery loop. Connecting to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), the TX contains a voltage-mode driver with current-mode injection for low-power output-swing-boosting and 3-tap feed-forward equalization (FFE). This link has been demonstrated in the control and readout of a complete superconducting quantum computing system.</description>

      <title>Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutral atom-based quantum processors at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, neutral atom-based quantum computation has been established as a competing alternative for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, as with other quantum technologies, various sources of noise limit their performance. With processors continuing to scale up, new techniques are needed to characterize and compare them in order to track their progress. In this work, we present two systematic benchmarks that evaluate these quantum processors at scale. We use the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to solve maximal independent set (MIS) instances of random unit-disk graphs. These benchmarks are scalable, relying not on prior knowledge of the system's evolution but on the quality of the MIS solutions obtained. We benchmark quera_aquila and pasqal_fresnel on problem sizes up to 102 and 85 qubits, respectively. Overall, quera_aquila performs better on QAOA and QAA instances. Finally, we generate MIS instances of up to 1000 qubits, providing scalable benchmarks for evaluating future, larger processors as they become available.</description>

      <title>Quantum relative entropy for unravelings of master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores connections between the quantum relative entropy of two faithful states $\rho,\sigma$ (i.e. full-rank density matrices) and the Kullback-Leibler divergences of classical measures $\mu,\nu$. Here, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are measures on the space of pure states, realizing $\rho$ and $\sigma$ respectively. The motivation for this result is to establish a notion of quantum relative entropy in the space of pure state distributions, which are the resulting objects of unravelings of the Lindblad equation, such as the stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Our results show that the measures that achieve the minimal KL divergence are those supported on a (possibly non-orthogonal) common basis between $\rho$ and $\sigma$. Using the classical and quantum data-processing inequalities, our notion of quantum relative entropy is shown to be equivalent to the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy on states, revealing new insights on this quantity. Furthermore, the common basis is used to provide a novel proof of contraction of the relative entropy under Lindblad flow and offers insights into results from large deviation theory.</description>

      <title>Secret Entanglement, Public Geometry. Quantum Cryptography from a Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can a secret be hidden not in which quantum state is prepared, but in the way that state \emph{moves} through its space of possibilities? Motivated by this question, we propose an essential geometric perspective on quantum cryptography in which projective Hilbert space and its entanglement foliations play a central role. The basic ingredients are: (a) the Fubini-Study metric on the manifold of pure states, (b) a family of entanglement measures viewed as scalar functions on this manifold, and (c) controlled trajectories generated by unitary operations.
  The geometric structure -- state manifold, metric, and allowed moves -- is fully public, as is the functional form of the entanglement family. What remains secret is the choice of parameter $\theta$ that selects a specific entanglement functional $E_\theta$ and the corresponding foliation into constant-entanglement hypersurfaces. In this setting, classical messages are encoded not only in the sequence of states but also in the pattern of upward, downward, or tangential steps with respect to the hidden foliation. We formalize this idea in terms of geometric entanglement codes and illustrate it with two toy constructions in which incompatible foliations play the role of mutually unbiased bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite several approaches proposed to operationally characterize quantum states of light-those that cannot be sampled with a positive distribution over classical states-most existing formulations suffer from limited practicality or rely on convex optimization procedures that are computationally demanding. In this work, we develop a general convex resource-theoretic framework to quantify optical quantumness directly from the norms of linear functionals of quantum states, thereby avoiding any optimization. We further establish a no-go theorem demonstrating that no universal measure of quantumness can exist in the absence of optimization. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical result through explicit examples involving both Gaussian and non-Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Tunable dual-band atomic mirror based on subwavelength atomic arrays under electromagnetically induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays offer a powerful platform for engineering cooperative light-matter interactions and enabling quantum metasurfaces. We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.</description>

      <title>Algebraic power scaling in a slowly-quenched bosonic quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic modes provide a promising platform for quantum batteries as a result of their unbounded energy spectrum. However, the energy that can be stored during a coherent charging process is limited due to coherent oscillations between the charger and battery. In this Letter, we show that by introducing a slow quench in the interaction between a coherently driven quadratic oscillator battery and a charger system, the maximum battery power ($P_{B,m}$) scales algebraically with the quench duration ($\tau_Q$), i.e., $P_{B,m} \propto \tau_Q^\alpha$, where $0&lt;\alpha\leq2$ is a function of the quench ramp exponent. This finding implies that, counterintuitively, slower quenches lead to faster charging. Such a quench suppresses coherent energy oscillations between the battery and the charger, allowing an unbounded increase in power. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of charger dissipation, which imposes a finite limit on the maximum power. We also show that the temporal extensive scaling occurs in a broader context by mapping the system to a coherently driven Tavis-Cummings battery.</description>

      <title>Efficient Identification of Permutation Symmetries in Many-Body Hamiltonians via Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational cost of simulating quantum many-body systems can often be reduced by taking advantage of physical symmetries. While methods exist for specific symmetry classes, a general algorithm to find the full permutation symmetry group of an arbitrary Pauli Hamiltonian is notably lacking. This paper introduces a new method that identifies this symmetry group by establishing an isomorphism between the Hamiltonian's permutation symmetry group and the automorphism group of a coloured bipartite graph constructed from the Hamiltonian. We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time. The algorithm's validity is empirically confirmed on various physical models with known symmetries. We further show that the problem of deciding whether two Hamiltonians are permutation-equivalent is polynomial-time reducible to the graph isomorphism problem using our graph representation. This work provides a general, structurally exact tool for algorithmic symmetry finding, enabling the scalable application of these symmetries to Hamiltonian simulation problems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Minimal Hilbert Space in the Classical Dual States of Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum spectroscopy of topological dynamics via a supersymmetric Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) characterizes complex dynamics through global invariants, but classical computation becomes prohibitive for high-dimensional data. We reinterpret time-domain dynamics as the eigenvalue spectrum of a supersymmetric (SUSY) Hamiltonian and thereby estimate topological descriptors through quantum spectroscopy. While zero modes correspond to Betti numbers, we show that low-lying excited states quantify the stability of topological features. Using a Takens embedding of the Lorenz system together with a resource-efficient quantum phase estimation implemented on IBM quantum hardware, we observe that the spectral gap of the SUSY Laplacian tracks the persistence of homological structures. Notably, the minimum of this spectral gap coincides with the onset of chaos, whereas its reopening reflects the geometric maturation of the attractor. Validated on small complexes yet offering an exponential advantage over classical diagonalization (from $O(N^3)$ to $\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$), this framework suggests that quantum hardware can function as a spectrometer for data topologies beyond classical reach.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness Estimation using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to estimate nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, measured by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Systems that saturate the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of all finite-dimensional quantum states that saturate the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit at arbitrary Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity. Employing a purification-based approach, we prove that mixed-state saturation occurs precisely when three structural criteria are fulfilled: the state's support is confined to the sum of two energy eigenspaces (the ground level and a single excited level); each eigenvector of the state with nonzero weight is a fixed superposition of one ground- and one excited-state energy eigenvector (determined by the minimizer of the objective function identified by Giovannetti et al.) and all such eigenvectors evolve in mutually orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces. These requirements impose a strict rank bound, ruling out saturation by any faithful state. For qubit systems, we derive a purity-resolved and tight Margolus-Levitin bound that reduces to the pure-state result in the limit of unit purity. Through a time-reversal argument, we further extend the dual Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit to mixed states and establish the corresponding saturation conditions.</description>

      <title>Identifying genuine entanglement of lossy noisy very large scale continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine entanglement identification of large scale systems is crucial for quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum learning advantage. In contrast to experiments, where noisy intermediate-scale programmable photonic quantum processors have been developed, theoretically very limited results have been achieved for detecting genuine entanglement of continuous variable multipartite systems. We propose a quite general and efficient entanglement detection framework for all kinds of multipartite entanglement of continuous variable systems based on uncertainty relations and the sign matrix technique. Matrix criteria are demonstrated and can be applied to various entanglement depth and k-separability problems of multimode systems. We illustrate the genuine entanglement conditions of continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of more than a hundred million modes in a photon loss and noise environment.</description>

      <title>Unrepeated White Rabbit Time Synchronisation over a 300 km Optical Fibre Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White Rabbit (WR) technology provides a commercially-available off-the-shelf solution for time synchronisation with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision over optical fibre links typically spanning tens of kilometres. Such high-performance time dissemination can support a variety of applications, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), financial transactions, metrology, as well as entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD). Demonstrations of WR over significantly longer distances remain few and far between, particularly in scenarios where intermediate amplification is unavailable, such as stretches of long-haul underwater fibre. In this work, we report the longest unrepeated deployment of WR to date, achieving time synchronisation over a 300 km (51.34 dB) single-span optical fibre link, even in highly asymmetrical configurations, with 99.86% uptime, whilst maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy. This was achieved through careful selection and optimisation of the components deployed at the link's end points. By leveraging standard telecom fibre and off-the-shelf hardware, our results pave the way for a scalable and standardised timing backbone for large-scale quantum networks, offering a practical route toward time distribution in future heterogeneous quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Inhibited radiative decay enhances single-photon emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks and the modular scaling of quantum computers require efficient spin-photon interfaces. This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cubature Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic codes utilize the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information, offering a hardware-efficient approach to quantum error correction. Designing these codes requires precise geometric arrangements of quantum states in the phase space. Here, we introduce Quantum Cubature Codes (QCCs), a powerful and generalized framework for constructing bosonic codes based on superpositions of coherent states. This formalism utilizes cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, which connect the continuous geometry of the phase space to discrete, weighted point sets, ensuring the conditions for error correction are met. We demonstrate that this framework provides a unifying perspective, revealing that well-established codes, such as cat codes and the recently proposed quantum spherical codes (QSCs), are specific instances of QCCs corresponding to uniform weights on a single energy shell. The QCC formalism unlocks a vast new design space, encompassing non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations. We leverage this framework to discover several new families of codes derived from Euclidean designs, allowing for greater geometric separation between logical states, which correlates with improved performance under photon loss. Numerical simulations under a pure-loss channel show that our multi-shell QCCs can outperform their single-shell counterparts by maximizing geometric separation with optimal energy at fixed pure-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Error Quantum Simulation via Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog Quantum Simulators offer a route to exploring strongly correlated many-body dynamics beyond classical computation, but their predictive power remains limited by the absence of quantitative error estimation. Establishing rigorous uncertainty bounds is essential for elevating such devices from qualitative demonstrations to quantitative scientific tools. Here we introduce a general framework for bounded-error quantum simulation, which provides predictions for many-body observables with experimentally quantifiable uncertainties. The approach combines Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning--a statistically rigorous inference of the coherent and dissipative generators governing the dynamics--with the propagation of their uncertainties into the simulated observables, yielding confidence bounds directly derived from experimental data. We demonstrate this framework on trapped-ion quantum simulators implementing long-range Ising interactions with up to 51 ions, and validate it where classical comparison is possible. We analyze error bounds on two levels. First, we learn an open-system model from experimental data collected in an initial time window of quench dynamics, simulate the corresponding master equation, and quantitatively verify consistency between theoretical predictions and measured dynamics at long times. Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage. The learned models reproduce the experimental evolution within the predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and internal consistency. Bounded-error quantum simulation provides a scalable foundation for trusted analog quantum computation, bridging the gap between experimental platforms and predictive many-body physics. The techniques presented here directly extend to digital quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation in driven-dephasing Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact renormalisation scheme for fermionic cellular automata on hypercubic lattices. By grouping neighbouring cells into tiles and selecting subspaces within them, multiple evolution steps on the original system correspond to a single step of an effective automaton acting on the subspaces. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalisability and fully characterise the renormalisation flow for two-cell tiles and two time steps of nearest-neighbour fermionic automata on a chain of spinless modes, identifying all fixed points.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Quantum Triality Relations in Open Qubit and Qutrit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the complementarity among coherence (visibility), predictability, and entanglement for qubit and qutrit systems subjected to noisy quantum channels. Using the system-path entanglement framework, analytical expressions for all three quantities are derived for two- and three-slit interferometric setups. The study first establishes the validity of the triality relation in ideal conditions and then investigates its behavior under amplitude and phase damping. We find that amplitude damping redistributes coherence and population imbalance without violating complementarity, while phase damping reduces coherence but leaves predictability unchanged. These results demonstrate that the complementarity relation remains preserved even in open quantum systems, highlighting its robustness against decoherence and providing a unified analytical understanding of noisy quantum interferometry in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Time Crystal as a light source for quantum enhanced sensing beyond the Heisenberg Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern precision measurements, such as interferometry for detecting gravitational waves, rely on the estimation of optical phases encoded in light fields. Here, we propose to exploit the collectively enhanced output field of a driven-dissipative many-body open quantum system as a light source in order to improve the precision of estimating optical phases. Pronounced temporal correlations of such output fields benefit the sensitivity of measurement protocols, which we show theoretically by employing a boundary time crystal as a light source. The fundamental bound on the precision of such estimation shows scaling with system size that surpasses the Heisenberg limit and obeys the standard quantum limit in the measurement time. This scaling can be partially harnessed by a protocol, in which the phase shifted light field is guided into an auxiliary replica system, which serves as a detector that is sensitive to non-trivial temporal correlations of the light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited number of qubits per chip remains a critical bottleneck in quantum computing, motivating the use of distributed architectures that interconnect multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). However, executing quantum algorithms across distributed systems requires careful co-design of algorithmic primitives and hardware architectures to manage circuit depth and entanglement overhead. We identify multivariate trace estimation as a key subroutine that is naturally suited for distribution, and broadly useful in tasks such as estimating R\'enyi entropies, virtual cooling and distillation, and certain applications of quantum signal processing. In this work, we introduce COMPAS, an architecture that realizes multivariate trace estimation across a multi-party network of interconnected modular and distributed QPUs by leveraging pre-shared entangled Bell pairs as resources. COMPAS adds only a constant depth overhead and consumes Bell pairs at a rate linear in circuit width, making it suitable for near-term hardware. Unlike other schemes, which must choose between asymptotic optimality in circuit depth or GHZ width, COMPAS achieves both at once. Additionally, we analyze network-level errors and simulate the effects of circuit-level noise on the architecture.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic for Matrix Product State Simulation of Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics of Two-Dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of non-integrable Hamiltonian many-body quantum systems are characterized by highly entangled wave functions. Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $\chi = 4096$ on a single A100 GPU. We compared our results to similar TFIM simulations on a digital quantum processor.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum polymorphisms to the complexity theory of non-local games. We use this notion to give a full characterisation of the existence of commutativity gadgets for relational structures, introduced by Ji as a method for achieving quantum soundness of classical CSP reductions. Prior to our work, a classification was only known in the Boolean case [Culf--Mastel, STOC'25]. As an application of our framework, we prove that the entangled CSP parameterised by odd cycles is undecidable. Furthermore, we establish a quantum version of Galois connection for entangled CSPs in the case of non-oracular quantum homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Random purification channel made simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23470v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Covert Communication and Key Generation Over Quantum State-Dependent Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study covert communication and covert secret key generation with positive rates over quantum state-dependent channels. Specifically, we consider fully quantum state-dependent channels when the transmitter shares an entangled state with the channel. We study this problem setting under two security metrics. For the first security metric, the transmitter aims to communicate covertly with the receiver while simultaneously generating a covert secret key, and for the second security metric, the transmitter aims to transmit a secure message covertly and generate a covert secret key with the receiver simultaneously. Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel. Additionally, we show that our results are optimal when the channel is classical and the state is available non-causally at both the transmitter and the receiver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) when the final state is a superposition of two non-degenerate states. The system consists of four states coupled by two light fields. We find the relative phase of the final superposition depends on relative amplitude, width and timing of the adiabatic transfer pulses. We discuss these results in the context of experiments measuring symmetry violation in atomic and molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Categorical Framework for Quantum-Resistant Zero-Trust AI Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of AI models necessitates robust, quantum-resistant security, particularly against adversarial threats. Here, we present a novel integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and zero trust architecture (ZTA), formally grounded in category theory, to secure AI model access. Our framework uniquely models cryptographic workflows as morphisms and trust policies as functors, enabling fine-grained, adaptive trust and micro-segmentation for lattice-based PQC primitives. This approach offers enhanced protection against adversarial AI threats. We demonstrate its efficacy through a concrete ESP32-based implementation, validating a crypto-agile transition with quantifiable performance and security improvements, underpinned by categorical proofs for AI security. The implementation achieves significant memory efficiency on ESP32, with the agent utilizing 91.86% and the broker 97.88% of free heap after cryptographic operations, and successfully rejects 100% of unauthorized access attempts with sub-millisecond average latency.</description>

      <title>Obstruction to Ergodicity from Locality and $U(1)$ Higher Symmetries on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the presence of \emph{any} exact $U(1)$ higher-form symmetry, under mild assumptions, presents a fundamental obstruction to ergodicity under unitary dynamics in lattice systems with local interactions and finite on-site Hilbert space dimension. Focusing on the two-dimensional case, we show that such systems necessarily exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation and explicitly construct Krylov sectors whose number scales exponentially with system size. While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them. Our symmetry-based approach is insensitive to details of the Hamiltonian and the lattice, providing a systematic explanation for ergodicity-breaking in a range of systems, including quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and spectral cusps from density-wave fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report two types of singularities that arise from fluctuations during the formation of charge- or spin-density waves. The first is the exceptional point (EP), corresponding to a higher-order pole of the retarded Green's function. Such EPs lead to algebraic corrections in the decay of quasiparticle occupations and are observable through time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES). The second is a spectral cusp, defined by the coalescence of three extrema in the real-frequency spectral function $A(\mathbf{k}, \omega)$. This cusp enforces the formation of Fermi arcs and induces a "threading" structure in the nearby band structure, both of which are directly observable in ARPES.</description>

      <title>Zoo of Correlation Inequalities in Holography and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study information-theoretic inequalities for holographic correlation measures $J_W$ and $D_W$, establishing rigorous topological frameworks that prove monotonicity, monogamy, and strong superadditivity. While earlier work proposed bulk duals of classical correlation and quantum discord, their information-theoretic properties were unclear. We derive multiple inequalities involving entanglement wedge cross sections (EWCS) and show that monotonicity holds for both measured and unmeasured parties in $J_W$ and for the unmeasured party in $D_W$. Unlike their original counterparts, we find that $J_W$ is monogamous for both parties and obeys one-way strong superadditivity, whereas $D_W$ is polygamous for the unmeasured party in pure tripartite states. These results highlight distinctive features of holographic states and support a conjectured duality between $J_W$ and distillable entanglement. Motivated by the relation between EWCS and reflected entropy, we introduce boundary analogues $J_R$ and $D_R$, which serve as computable proxies for classical and quantum correlations without optimization. We analyze their inequalities, proving several and presenting counterexamples. Overall, we provide a systematic "zoo" of correlation inequalities in and beyond holography, clarifying connections among bulk geometry, discord-type correlations, and distillable entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Escalating cyber threats and the high-dimensional complexity of IoT traffic have outpaced classical anomaly detection methods. While deep learning offers improvements, computational bottlenecks limit real-time deployment at scale. We present a quantum autoencoder (QAE) framework that compresses network traffic into discriminative latent representations and employs quantum support vector classification (QSVC) for intrusion detection. Evaluated on three datasets, our approach achieves improved accuracy on ideal simulators and on the IBM Quantum hardware demonstrating practical quantum advantage on current NISQ devices. Crucially, moderate depolarizing noise acts as implicit regularization, stabilizing training and enhancing generalization. This work establishes quantum machine learning as a viable, hardware-ready solution for real-world cybersecurity challenges.</description>

      <title>Shaping Causality: Emergence of Nonlocal Light Cones in Long-Range Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While for non-relativistic short-range interactions, the spread of information is local, remaining confined in an effective light cone, long-range interactions can generate either nonlocal (faster-than-ballistic) or local (ballistic) spread of correlations depending on the initial conditions. This makes long-range interactions a rich platform for controlling the spread of information. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian analytically and identify the specific interaction term that drives nonlocality in a wide class of long-range spin chains. This allows us to understand the conditions for the emergence of local behavior in the presence of nonlocal interactions and to identify a regime where the causal space-time landscape can be precisely designed. Indeed, we show that for large long-range interaction strength or large system size, initial conditions can be chosen in a way that allows a local perturbation to generate nonlocal signals at programmable distant positions, which then propagate within effective light cones. The possibility of engineering the emergence of nonlocal Lieb-Robinson-like light cones allows one to shape the causal landscape of long-range interacting systems, with direct applications to quantum information processing devices, quantum memories, error correction, and information transport in programmable quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: We study how to recover timelike worldlines in AdS from CFT data as a toy model for holographically reconstructing realistic observers. We give a bulk extremization procedure that determines composite timelike-spacelike geodesics that connect timelike-separated boundary points. The total geodesic length matches the length extracted from CFT correlators at the timelike-separated points. We show agreement in Poincar\'e AdS, for generic boundary points in global AdS, and also for the BTZ solution, in which the timelike segment probes behind the horizon. We refine related methods to compute timelike entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and recover known results.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions of the anisotropic Dicke-Ising model in driven Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a generalized Dicke-Ising model realized with an array of Rydberg atoms, driven by microwave electric fields and coupled to an optical cavity. As this platform allows for a precisely tunable anisotropy parameter, the model exhibits a rich landscape of phase transitions and critical phenomena, induced by the interplay of rotating-wave, counter-rotating-wave, and Ising interactions. We develop an improved quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the stochastic series expansion that explicitly tracks the Fock state of the quantum cavity. In the superradiant (SR) phase, this allows us to determine, through data collapse, the scaling laws of the photon number. We also demonstrate the vanishing of parity symmetry in finite-size simulations and show that the Rydberg blockade leads to a significant suppression of cavity occupation. Notably, stronger quantum fluctuations induced by the counter-rotating wave terms slightly favor the superradiant solid (SRS) phase over the Solid-1/2 state. Finally, we confirm that the SR phase transition and the transition from the Solid-1/2 to the SRS are second-order. In contrast, the transitions from the Solid-1/2 or SRS to the SR phase are both first-order for any value of the normalized anisotropy parameter.</description>

      <title>Twisted (co)homology of non-orientable Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.</description>

      <title>A programming language combining quantum and classical control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two main notions of control in quantum programming languages are often referred to as "quantum" control and "classical" control. With the latter, the control flow is based on classical information, potentially resulting from a quantum measurement, and this paradigm is well-suited to mixed state quantum computation. Whereas with quantum control, we are primarily focused on pure quantum computation and there the "control" is based on superposition. The two paradigms have not mixed well traditionally and they are almost always treated separately. In this work, we show that the paradigms may be combined within the same system. The key ingredients for achieving this are: (1) syntactically: a modality for incorporating pure quantum types into a mixed state quantum type system; (2) operationally: an adaptation of the notion of "quantum configuration" from quantum lambda-calculi, where the quantum data is replaced with pure quantum primitives; (3) denotationally: suitable (sub)categories of Hilbert spaces, for pure computation and von Neumann algebras, for mixed state computation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</description>

Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tensor network ansatz for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.</description>

      <title>Integrated polarization-entangled photon source for wavelength-multiplexed quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled photons are fundamental resources for quantum communication, computing, and networking. Among them, polarization-entangled photon pairs play an important role due to their straightforward state manipulation and direct use in quantum key distribution, teleportation, and network protocols. However, realizing compact, efficient, and scalable polarization-entangled sources that meet the requirements of practical deployment remains a major challenge. Here, we present a simple yet high-performance on-chip polarization-entangled photon-pair source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our device employs dual quasi-phase matching (D-QPM) that sequentially supports type-0 and type-I spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a single nanophotonic waveguide, eliminating the need for interferometers, polarization rotators, or other complex circuits. The source directly produces high-fidelity Bell states with broad bandwidth, high brightness, and low noise. Using this integrated platform, we realize wavelength-multiplexed entanglement distribution in a four-user quantum network deployed over metropolitan fiber links up to 50 km. These results establish a robust and scalable pathway toward practical quantum communication systems and multi-user quantum mesh networks based on integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Odd Viscoelastic Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a class of nonlinear odd viscoelastic effects in three spatial dimensions. We show that these dissipationless effects arise upon combining strains in two orthogonal directions, yielding momentum flow in the third direction. We demonstrate that the effect arises from nontrivial geometric tensors in quantum states, and can be scaled up with integer topological invariants. We further demonstrate that the effect fingerprints the multiband Hilbert-space geometry of underlying quantum states, as encoded in three-state geometric tensors. Our findings unravel the role of multistate geometry in viscoelastic phenomena, paving a path for experimental observation of uncharted nonlinear odd viscoelastic responses in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Denotational semantics for stabiliser quantum programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stabiliser fragment of quantum theory is a foundational building block for quantum error correction and the fault-tolerant compilation of quantum programs. In this article, we develop a sound, universal and complete denotational semantics for stabiliser operations which include measurement, classically-controlled Pauli operators, and affine classical operations, in which quantum error-correcting codes are first-class objects. The operations are interpreted as certain affine relations over finite fields. This offers a conceptually motivated and computationally-tractable alternative to the standard operator-algebraic semantics of quantum programs (whose time complexity grows exponentially as the state space increases in size). We demonstrate the power of the resulting semantics by describing a small, proof-of-concept assembly language for stabiliser programs with fully-abstract denotational semantics.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>

      <title>Generation of concurrence in a generalized central spin model with a three-spin interacting environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the three-spin Ising model to study the effect of three-spin interacting term on bi-partitie entanglement between adjacent spins. The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced frequency shift in semiconductor spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits have proven to be a feasible candidate for quantum computation, and some realizations of spin qubits already benefit from advanced device manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</description>

      <title>Refinements of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis under Local Rotational Invariance via Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling Dissipative Topology Through Floquet Driving: From Transient Diagnostics to Boundary States Isolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.</description>

Abstract: Non-classical states of light play a fundamental role in quantum technology. From photonic quantum computers and simulators, to quantum communication and sensing, quantum states of light enable performing tasks that may outperform their best classical counterparts. Semiconductor quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures offer the most advanced classes of quantum light sources. Importantly, the underlying physics processes determining device performance are today fully understood, and dedicated engineering projects are currently advancing these sources towards real-world quantum technology applications. We review the performance of deterministic single-photon sources based on quantum dots in photonic crystal waveguides, the approach with the highest performance specs since it intrinsically combines suppression of leaky modes and Purcell enhancement to slow-light waveguide mode. Furthermore, we present prototype data from sources that today are commercially available and with performance metrics approaching the ideal.</description>

      <title>A permanent-magnet Zeeman slower and magneto-optical trap for calcium atoms for ultracold Rydberg physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the construction and characterization of an experimental setup for producing a cold gas of $^{40}$Ca atoms and excite them to high Rydberg states with a resonant three-photon-excitation scheme. The apparatus comprises four stages, each designed in-house. An oven heated to $\sim 500^\circ$C generates an atomic beam that is collimated by a capillary stack. The beam is sent into a passive, permanent-magnet-based Zeeman slower that reduces the atomic velocity to $30$ m/s. The slow atoms are captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and cooled to $1.0(3)$ mK with a trapping time of $16(2)$ ms. Ground-state atoms in the cold gas are excited to high Rydberg states via resonant excitation through the intermediate $4s4p\, ^1P_1$ and $4s4d\, ^1D_2$ states. The MOT is operated at the center of an electrode stack, which serves to apply continuous and pulsed electric fields and field-ionize the Rydberg atoms for detection. We benchmark our MOT against previous implementations and find its performance consistent with state-of-the-art results in terms of temperature and trapping lifetime. Finally, we demonstrate Rydberg spectroscopy of calcium, confirming the system's suitability for ultracold Rydberg physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: A quantitative description of the exchange interaction in quantum dots is relevant for modeling gate operations of spin qubits. By measuring the amplitude and frequency of exchange-driven qubit state oscillations, we measure the detuning dependence of the exchange coupling in a GaAs double quantum dot over three orders of magnitude. Both 1D and 3D full configuration interaction simulations can replicate the observed behavior. Extending a Hubbard model by including excited states increases the range of detuning where it provides a good fit, thus elucidating the underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Probing the Fermi Sea Topology in a Quantum Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pauli's exclusion principle forces fermions to occupy distinct quantum states, creating a filled region of momentum space at low temperature, the Fermi sea, whose topology governs the system's response to perturbations and the nature of its correlation functions. Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological invariant that describes its shape -- is encoded in its ($D$+1)-point density correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate this connection in a two-dimensional degenerate gas of neutral $^{6}$Li atoms using single-atom-resolved imaging. By measuring three- and four-point connected density correlations in real space, we directly extract topological invariants of the underlying Fermi sea, including the Euler characteristic. Our results are in remarkable agreement with ideal-gas predictions, despite the presence of sizeable interactions, and establish a new pathway for probing many-body topology through correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement features of primordial non-gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss some entanglement features associated with cubic non-Gaussian perturbations in single-field inflationary scenarios. We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll.</description>

      <title>Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.
  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.
  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary control of the temporal waveform of photons during spontaneous emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control of the temporal waveform and Fock state statistics of photons produced during spontaneous emission from single quantum emitters provides a crucial tool in the establishment of hybrid quantum systems, optimal state transfer and interferometric stability of network architectures based on flying qubits. We describe a method to generate photons of any temporal waveform from emitters of any lifetime. Our broadly applicable approach has only two requirements for a candidate qudit: (1) control of the phase-parity and (2) modulation of the amplitude of a field coupling a ground state to an excited manifold which produces a photon during relaxation. We detail how to find optimal excitation pulse shapes, both numerically and experimentally, by employing variational algorithms to feedback on atomic populations. Additionally, we develop Quantum Monte Carlo based tools to determine emission statistics and establish techniques for optimal post-selection to ensure maximum fidelity of photon generation protocols. We situate our work in the context of other prior research on bespoke single photon sources and networking including post-emission pulse shaping, temporal gating and cavity-based methods. In comparison, our free-space process has greater flexibility in producing any waveform, requires less infrastructure and can be readily applied across a wide domain of emitters of any frequency or lifetime. We demonstrate temporal waveform shaping in $^{174}$Yb$^+$ trapped ions. Using feedforward validation of photon waveforms, we estimate an achievable process fidelity of at least $\approx$0.996.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05790v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization of constrained quantum control problems powers quantum technologies. This task becomes very difficult when these control problems are nonconvex and plagued with dense local extrema. For such problems current optimization methods must be repeated many times to find good solutions, each time requiring many simulations of the system. Here, we present quantum control via polynomial optimization (QCPOP), a method that eliminates this problem by directly finding globally optimal solutions. The resulting increase in speed, which can be a thousandfold or more, makes it possible to solve problems that were previously intractable. This remarkable advance is due to global optimization methods recently developed for polynomial functions. We demonstrate the power of this method by showing that it obtains an optimal solution in a single run for a problem in which local extrema are so dense that gradient methods require thousands of runs to reach a similar fidelity. Since QCPOP is able to find the global optimum for quantum control, we expect that it will not only enhance the utility of quantum control by making it much easier to find the necessary protocols, but also provide a key tool for understanding the precise limits of quantum technologies. Finally, we note that the ability to cast quantum control as polynomial optimization resolves an open question regarding the computability of exact solutions to quantum control problems.</description>

Abstract: We present tools and methods to generalize parity compilation to digital quantum computing devices with arbitrary connectivity graphs and construct circuit implementations for the constraint Hamiltonian of higher-order constrained binary optimization problems. In particular, we show how even non-local constraints can be efficiently implemented without expensive SWAP gates. We show how the presented tools can be used to optimize the total circuit depth and CNOT count of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in the parity architecture and highlight the advantages of the flexible compilation using various examples. We derive the relation between the developed gate sequences and the traditional approach that uses SWAP gates. The result can be applied to improve the implementation of many other non-local operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity compilation is the challenge of laying out the required constraints for the parity mapping in a local way. We present the first constructive compilation algorithm for the parity architecture using plaquettes for arbitrary higher-order optimization problems. This enables adiabatic protocols, where the plaquette layout can natively be implemented, as well as fully parallelized digital circuits. The algorithm builds a rectangular layout of plaquettes, where in each layer of the rectangle at least one constraint is added. The core idea is that each constraint, consisting of any qubits on the boundary of the rectangle and some new qubits, can be decomposed into plaquettes with a deterministic procedure using ancillas. We show how to pick a valid set of constraints and how this decomposition works. We further give ways to optimize the ancilla count and show how to implement optimization problems with additional constraints.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant quantum computing with the parity code and noise-biased qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fault-tolerant universal quantum computing architecture based on a code concatenation of biased-noise qubits and the parity architecture. The parity architecture can be understood as an LDPC code tailored specifically to obtain any desired logical connectivity from nearest-neighbor physical interactions. The code layout can be dynamically adjusted to algorithmic requirements on-the-fly. This allows for implementations with any desired code distance with a universal set of fault-tolerant gates. In addition to the previously explored tool-sets for concatenated cat codes, our approach features parallelizable interactions between arbitrary sets of qubits by directly addressing the parity qubits in the code. The proposed scheme enables codes with less physical qubit overhead compared to the repetition code with the same code distances, while requiring only weight-3 and weight-4 stabilizers and nearest-neighbor 2D square-lattice connectivity.</description>

      <title>Optically Hyperpolarized Materials for Levitated Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of levitating solids embedded with non-permanent, optically controllable electron spins, which can be used to hyperpolarize their nuclear spin environment with exceptionally long lifetimes. For example, pentacene-doped naphthalene, which will also serve as our prime example, can achieve bulk polarization exceeding $80\,\%$ at cryogenic temperatures with polarization lifetimes extending over weeks. These materials make a compelling case for applications such as matter-wave interferometry and novel uses of established NMR techniques. In that spirit, we design a multi-spin Stern-Gerlach-type interferometry protocol which, thanks to the homogeneous spin distribution and the absence of a preferential nuclear-spin quantization axis in such materials, avoids many of the limitations associated with solid state crystals hosting electronic spin defects, such as nanodiamonds containing NV centers. We assess the potential of our interferometer to enhance existing bounds on the free parameters of objective collapse models. Beyond matter-wave interferometry, we analyze the prospects for implementing magic angle spinning at frequencies surpassing the current standard in NMR, capitalizing on the exceptional rotational capabilities offered by levitation. Additionally, we outline a novel protocol for measuring spin ensemble polarization via the position of the nanoparticle and conduct an analysis of dominant noise sources, benchmarking the required isolation levels for various applications.</description>

      <title>Anti-Concentration for the Unitary Haar Measure and Applications to Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Carbery-Wright style anti-concentration inequality for the unitary Haar measure, by showing that the probability of a polynomial in the entries of a random unitary falling into an $\varepsilon$ range is at most a polynomial in $\varepsilon$. Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum circuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at least inverse exponential in depth, on any output qubit touched by its lightcone. Our result on scrambling speed works with high probability over the choice of a circuit from an ensemble, as opposed to just working in expectation.
  As an application, we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning log-depth random quantum circuits with Haar random gates up to polynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit. Other applications of this new scrambling speed lower bound include:
  $\bullet$ An optimal $\Omega(\log \varepsilon^{-1})$ depth lower bound for $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary designs on any circuit architecture;
  $\bullet$ A polynomial-time quantum algorithm that computes the depth of a bounded-depth circuit, given oracle access to the circuit.
  Our learning and depth-testing algorithms apply to architectures defined over any geometric dimension, and can be generalized to a wide class of architectures with good lightcone properties.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing crosstalk in large-scale QPUs using zero-entropy classical shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum processing units (QPUs) scale toward hundreds of qubits, diagnosing noise-induced correlations (crosstalk) becomes critical for reliable quantum computation. In this work, we introduce Zero-Entropy Classical Shadows (ZECS), a diagnostic tool that uses information of a rank-one quantum state tomography (QST) reconstruction from classical shadow (CS) information to make a crosstalk diagnosis. We use ZECS on trapped ion and superconductive QPUs, including ionq_forte (36 qubits), ibm_brisbane (127 qubits), and ibm_fez (156 qubits), using from 1,000 to 6,000 samples. With these samples, we use the ZECS to characterize crosstalk among disjoint qubit subsets across the full hardware. This information is then used to select low-crosstalk qubit subsets on ibm_fez for executing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a 20-qubit problem. Compared to the best qubit selection via Qiskit transpilation, our method improves solution quality by 10% and increases algorithmic coherence by 33%. ZECS offers a scalable and measurement-efficient approach to diagnosing crosstalk in large-scale QPUs.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Mpemba-like patterns in effective temperature dynamics of strongly coupled dissipative quantum chaotic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalous thermalization, particularly the crossings of temperature trajectories from different initial states termed Mpemba crossings (MPCs), have intrigued scientists for decades. While recent studies in quantum systems suggest that initial conditions play a decisive role in its emergence, they offer limited insight into MPCs in complex, highly nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we investigate temperature dynamics in the strongly coupled, quantum chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is dual to the low-energy dynamics of 2D dilaton gravity. Our findings reveal a dynamically driven nonequilibrium mechanism underlying MPCs during rapid thermalization, with implications for gravitational systems. We explore quench dynamics in SYK systems under three conditions: coupling to a single SYK thermal bath, coupling to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. We find that strong system-bath coupling induces oscillating effective temperatures and trajectory crossings in transient states due to nonequilibrium statistics, phenomena absent in quasi-static thermodynamics and Lindbladian SYKs. These MPCs highlight a unique feature of anomalous thermalization of strongly coupled quantum chaotic systems driven far from equilibrium. Besides, the results also provide qualitative insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes strongly interacting with their environment, such as primordial black holes in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing the non-classical correlations of a complex many-body system is an important part of quantum technologies. A versatile tool for such a task is one that scales well with the size of the system and which can be both easily computed and measured. In this work we focus on graph states, that are promising platforms for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. We consider four topologies, namely the star graph states with edges, Tur\'an graphs, $r$-ary tree graphs, and square grid cluster states, and provide a method to characterise their quantum content: the many-body Bell correlations, non-separability and entanglement depth for an arbitrary number of qubits. We also relate the strength of these many-body correlations to the usefulness of graph states for quantum sensing. Finally, we characterize many-body entanglement depth in graph states with up to $8$ qubits in $146$ classes non-equivalent under local transformations and graph isomorphisms. The technique presented is simple and does not make any assumptions about the multi-qubit state, so it could find applications wherever precise knowledge of many-body quantum correlations is required.</description>

      <title>The composition rule for quantum systems is not the only possible one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory provides a significant example of two intermingling hallmarks of science: the ability to consistently combine physical systems and study them compositely; and the power to extract predictions in the form of correlations. A striking consequence of this facet is the violation of Bell inequalities, which has been experimentally demonstrated via Bell tests, thus attesting a classical/quantum divide. The prediction of this phenomenon originates as quantum systems are prescribed to combine according to the composition postulate, i.e., the tensor-product rule. This rule has also an operationally salient formulation -- rather than just a purely mathematical one -- given in terms of discriminability of composite states via local measurements. Yet, both the theoretical and the empirical status of such a postulate have been constantly challenged over the decades: is it possible to deduce it from the remaining postulates? Here, this long-standing problem is solved by answering in the negative. A family of operational theories is presented, differing from standard quantum theory solely in their system-composition rule, while, at the same time, being indistinguishable from it via Bell-like or more general correlation experiments. Quantum theory is thus established to embody genuinely more than quantum correlations. As a result, foundational programmes based on single-system principles only, or on mere Bell-like correlations, are operationally incomplete. On the experimental side, ascertaining the independence of postulates is a fundamental step to adjudicate between quantum theory and alternative physical theories: hence, the composition postulate calls for experimental scrutiny independently of the other features of quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for Floquet prethermalization under strong resonant driving, emphasizing the pivotal role of dynamical space-time symmetries. Our approach demonstrates how dynamical space-time symmetries map onto the projective static symmetry group of the prethermal Hamiltonian governing the prethermal regime. We introduce techniques for detecting dynamical symmetries through the time evolution of local observables, facilitating a detailed analysis of micromotion within each period and surpassing the limitations of conventional stroboscopic Floquet prethermal dynamics. To implement this framework, we present a prethermal protocol that preserves order-two dynamical symmetry in a spin-ladder model, confirming the predicted relationships between the expectation values of local observables at distinct temporal points in the Floquet cycle, linked by this symmetry.</description>

      <title>Programming tools for Analogue Quantum Computing in the High-Performance Computing Context -- A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16943</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have brought us closer to realizing the potential of this transformative technology. While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way:
  Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities.
  Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration.
  Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for laser models producing a beam with sub-Poissonian photon statistics and coherence scaling as the Heisenberg limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in laser theory have demonstrated that a quantum enhancement is possible for the production of coherence $\mathfrak{C}$ by a continuous-wave laser device. Curiously, natural families of laser models that achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling for coherence produce the most coherence when the beam exhibits sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In this work, we provide an analytical treatment of those novel families of laser models by specializing to a parameter regime that permits a linearization. We characterize the dynamics of each laser system, and find that some of the intuitions from standard laser theory may be applied here. Specifically, the intracavity number dynamics are well-described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the intracavity phase dynamics are well-described in terms of a physically realizable ensemble of pure states, which evolve according to pure phase diffusion. Unlike a standard laser, however, we find that the pure states comprising the ensemble in the Heisenberg-limited lasers are substantially phase squeezed. From our dynamical analysis, we deduce various quantities of the beam for each laser family, including the first- and second-order Glauber coherence functions, intensity noise spectrum, Mandel-Q parameter and coherence $\mathfrak{C}$. In addition, inspired from these phase diffusion dynamics, we derive an upper bound on laser coherence $\mathfrak{C} \lesssim 1.1156 \mu^4$ -- which is tighter by a factor of $3/8$ when compared to that derived in [Baker et al., Nat. Phys. 17 179 (2021)] -- by making one of the assumptions of that paper slightly stronger.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement is not necessary for standard device-independent conference key agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conference key agreement aims to establish shared, private randomness among many separated parties in a network. Device-independent conference key agreement (DICKA) is a variant in which the source and the measurement devices used by each party need not be trusted. So far, DICKA protocols largely fall into two categories: those that rely on violating a joint Bell inequality using genuinely multi-partite entangled states, and those that concatenate many bipartite protocols. The question of whether a hybrid protocol exists, where a multi-partite Bell inequality can be violated using only bipartite entanglement, was asked by Grasselli et al. in [Quantum 7, 980, (2023)]. We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing an asymptotically secure DICKA protocol achieving the same rate as the concatenation of bipartite device-independent quantum key distribution, yet relying on a single joint Bell violation. Our results prompt further discussion on the benefits of multi-partite entanglement for DICKA over its bipartite alternative, and we give an overview of different arguments for near-term devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically addressable solid-state spins have been extensively studied for quantum technologies, offering unique advantages for quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Advancing these applications is generally limited by finding materials that simultaneously provide lifetime-limited optical and long spin coherences. Here, we introduce $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$ ions doped into a CaWO$_4$ crystal. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy of the excited state, and demonstrate all-optical coherent control of the electron-nuclear spin ensemble. We find narrow inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions of 185 MHz and radiative-lifetime-limited coherence time up to 0.75~ms. Next to this, we measure a spin-transition ensemble line width of 5 kHz and electron-nuclear spin coherence time reaching 0.15~seconds at zero magnetic field between 50~mK and 1~K temperatures. These results demonstrate the potential of $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ as a low-noise platform for building quantum technologies with ensemble-based memories, microwave-to-optical transducers, and optically addressable single-ion spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Topological response in open quantum systems with weak symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, the interaction of the system with its environment gives rise to two types of symmetry: a strong one, where the system's symmetry charge is conserved exactly, and a weak one, where the system can exchange symmetry charge with the environment but still preserve symmetry at the ensemble level. While generic open quantum systems feature weak symmetries only, the symmetry protected topological response for bosonic/spin systems has only been considered in the stricter setup with additional strong symmetries. Here, we address the generic case and demonstrate that weak symmetries alone can protect topological responses that distinguish different phases of matter. For bosonic systems, focusing on one-dimensional mixed states described by locally purifiable density operators, we propose a quantized response characterizing qualitatively distinct phases. It is detectable via the decay behavior of different string order parameters. We illustrate our general results through a noisy Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. In particular, we show that the coupling to the environment can induce a phase transition to a state protected by weak symmetries, without a pure-state or strong-symmetry analog.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Transformers integrate the representational power of classical Transformers with the computational advantages of quantum computing. Since 2022, research in this area has rapidly expanded, giving rise to diverse technical paradigms and early applications. To address the growing need for consolidation, this paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth survey of quantum Transformer models. First, we delineate the research scope, focusing on improving Transformer parts with quantum methods, and introduce foundational concepts in classical Transformers and quantum machine learning. Then we organize existing studies into two main paradigms: PQC-based and QLA-based, with PQC-based paradigm further divided into QKV-only Quantum Mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Holistic Attention. and Quantum-Assisted Optimization, analyzing their core mechanisms and architectural traits. We also summarize empirical results that demonstrate preliminary quantum advantages, especially on small-scale tasks or resource-constrained settings. Following this, we examine key technical challenges, such as complexity-resource trade-offs, scalability and generalization limitations, and trainability issues including barren plateaus, and provide potential solutions, including quantumizing classical transformer variants with lower complexity, hybrid designs, and improved optimization strategies. Finally, we propose several promising future directions, e.g., scaling quantum modules into large architectures, applying quantum Transformers to domains with inherently quantum data (e.g., physics, chemistry), and developing theory-driven designs grounded in quantum information science. This survey will help researchers and practitioners quickly grasp the overall landscape of current quantum Transformer research and promote future developments in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Native-oxide-passivated trilayer junctions for superconducting qubits</title>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits in today's quantum processing units are typically fabricated with angle-evaporated aluminum--aluminum-oxide--aluminum Josephson junctions. However, there is an urgent need to overcome the limited reproducibility of this approach when scaling up the number of qubits and junctions. Fabrication methods based on subtractive patterning of superconductor--insulator--superconductor trilayers, used for more classical large-scale Josephson junction circuits, could provide the solution but they in turn often suffer from lossy dielectrics incompatible with high qubit coherence. In this work, we utilize native aluminum oxide as a sidewall passivation layer for junctions based on aluminum--aluminum-oxide--niobium trilayers, and use such junctions in qubits. We design the fabrication process such that the few-nanometer-thin native oxide is not exposed to oxide removal steps that could increase its defect density or hinder its ability to prevent shorting between the leads of the junction. With these junctions, we design and fabricate transmon-like qubits and measure time-averaged coherence times up to 30 $\mu$s at a qubit frequency of 5 GHz, corresponding to a qubit quality factor of one million. Our process uses subtractive patterning and optical lithography on wafer scale, enabling high throughput in patterning. This approach provides a scalable path toward fabrication of superconducting qubits on industry-standard platforms.</description>

Abstract: The discrepancy between quantum distinguishability in Hilbert space and classical distinguishability in probability space is expressed by the gap between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices (QFIM and CFIM, respectively). This intrinsic quantum obstruction is generally not saturable and plays a central role in both fundamental insights and practical applications in modern quantum physics. Here, we develop a geometrical framework for this gap by introducing the notion of semi-classical geometric tensor (SCGT). We relate this quantity to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real part equals the QFIM. We prove the matrix inequality between QGT and SCGT, which sharpens the standard inequality between QFIM and CFIM and provides novel multiparameter information bounds: the real part of the SCGT reproduces the CFIM plus an additional nonnegative contribution capturing quantum obstruction. This further motivates a natural extension of the Berry phase to the semi-classical setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To find practical application as photon sources for entangled optical resource states or as spin-photon interfaces in entangled networks, semiconductor emitters must produce indistinguishable photons with high efficiency and spectral stability. Nanophotonic cavity integration increases efficiency and bandwidth, but it also introduces environmental charge instability and spectral diffusion. Among various candidates, silicon colour centres have emerged as compelling platforms for integrated-emitter quantum technologies. Here we investigate the dynamics of spectral wandering in nanophotonics-coupled, individual silicon T centres using spectral correlation measurements. We observe that spectral fluctuations are driven predominantly by the near-infrared excitation laser, consistent with a power-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and show that the spectrum is stable for up to 1.5 ms in the dark. We demonstrate a 35x narrowing of the emitter linewidth to 110 MHz using a resonance-check scheme and discuss the advantage for pairwise entanglement rates and optical resource state generators. Finally, we report laser-induced spin-mixing in the excited state and discuss potential mechanisms common to both phenomena. These effects must be considered in calibrating T centre devices for high-performance entanglement generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian singularities associated with the coalescence of individual eigenvectors accompanied by the degeneracy of their complex energies. Here, we report the discovery of a generalization to the concept of EP called exceptional deficiency (ED), which features the complete coalescence of two eigenspaces with identical but arbitrarily large dimensions and the coincidence of entire spectral continua. The characteristics of the ED are studied using one-way coupled Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices. The ED can induce an anomalous absence and presence of non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that transcends the topological bulk-edge correspondence of NHSE, resulting in unexpected synergistic skin-propagative dynamics. The conditions of the ED are also explored for unprecedented control of localization and propagation in non-Hermitian systems. These effects are experimentally observed using active mechanical lattices. The discovery of ED opens multiple new frontiers in non-Hermitian physics and can potentially resolve long-standing challenges in related applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in the weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase covariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital (dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we explore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit, quantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the measures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC dynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the spin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through metrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We further examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in shaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson model's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in quantum thermodynamic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00872v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field electron emission (FE) and electrostatic field ionization (ESFI) are quantum-mechanical tunnelling processes that provide basic theory for important technologies. However, the basic theories of FE and ESF1 are not yet completely understood. This paper attempts to identify related fundamental quantum mechanical issues, problems and relevances. The following topics have been identified as deserving closer investigation or discussion. (a) The implication that if a "real electron" cannot have negative kinetic energy, then this necessarily implies that a "real electron" is a distributed object rather than a point object. (b) The implication that the language we use to discuss quantum mechanics needs to be changed in order to avoid referring to the "position of a (point) electron". (c) The idea that "quantum mathematics" (i.e., the mathematics of quantum mechanics) has different utilisations, namely the "matter distribution" and "pathway choice" utilisations, with "measurement" being observed pathway choice. (d) Difficulties with the present formulations of the uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality. (e) Fundamental difficulties in the exact calculation of exchange-and-correlation effects in both FE and ESFI theory. (f) Conceptual problems associated with "seeing electrons" in the field electron (emission) microscope. (g) Field emission tunnelling and the arrow of time. (h) The choice between tunnelling-integral and overlap-integral formulations of tunnelling theory, and the apparent incompleteness of both types of formulation.</description>

      <title>A mathematical justification to apply the secular approximation to the Redfield equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum master equations are widely used to describe the dynamics of open quantum systems. All these different master equations rely on specific approximations that may or may not be justified. Starting from a microscopic model, applying the standard Born and Markov approximations results in the Redfield equation that does not guarantee to preserve positivity. The latter is typically achieved by additionally applying the secular approximation resulting in a quantum master equation in Lindblad form. There are other ways to obtain an equation in Lindblad form, one of which is the recently proposed Universal Lindblad Equation. It has been shown that it is in the same equivalence class of approximations as the Redfield master equation although avoiding the heuristic secular approximation [arXiv:2004.01469]. In this work, we prove that the solutions of the master equation obtained by applying the secular approximation are also obtained by an approximation of the same order as the one performed to obtain the Redfield equation. We hereby provide a mathematical justification for the secular approximation. We show that the result of applying the secular approximation is obtained naturally by applying a self-consistency argument. This shows that the resulting master equation is also in the same equivalence class of approximations as the Redfield master equation and the Universal Lindblad Equation. We furthermore compare it to the Universal Lindblad Equation numerically and show numerical evidence that the master equation obtained through the secular approximation yields more accurate solutions.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Quantum Violation of Macrorealism in Large-spin Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of macroscopic classical behavior from quantum foundations via the entropic Leggett--Garg inequality. We introduce a geometric framework for deriving entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities with higher-order temporal correlations and demonstrate their advantages over conventional formulations. Numerical analyses show that entropic Leggett--Garg inequalities offer a robust and complementary criterion to standard approaches, providing a transparent information theoretic interpretation that facilitates the characterization of coherent quantum processes. By applying the WKB approximation, we prove that violations for maximally mixed states remain bounded by a constant in the macroscopic limit, indicating that macrorealism dominates in generic parameter regimes. We further explain previously reported maximal violations at specific parameter regimes as a consequence of the breakdown of the WKB approximation. Our findings indicate that quantum and classical descriptions remain macroscopically incompatible, while violations persist only in fine-tuned regimes, clarifying the conditions for detecting macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exponential distillation of dominant eigenproperties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating observable expectation values in eigenstates of quantum systems has a broad range of applications and is an area where early fault-tolerant quantum computers may provide practical quantum advantage. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian and remarkably, can be compared to phase estimation combined with amplitude estimation in terms of its scaling with respect to a target precision. We demonstrate in a broad range of numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early fault-tolerant settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a 100-qubit example that direct classical simulation of our approach enables the prediction of ground and excited state properties of quantum systems using tensor network techniques, which we recognize as a quantum-inspired classical approach.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Superradiant Peak Emission in Spatially Extended Emitter Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity exactly for many spatially separated emitters remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Based on third-order cumulant expansion methods, we present general scaling laws for the expononent of the peak emission rate as a function of the emitter number in free-space emitter arrays and arrays coupled to one-dimensional waveguide reservoirs. We find, that for 1D chains in free-space the peak emission rate scales linearly with $N$, while for 2D and 3D arrays with finite emitter spacing it scales superlinearly but sub-quadratically. For emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs we find that the peak emission rate scales quadratically with $N$.</description>

      <title>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13689v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</description>

      <title>Certified randomness from quantum speed limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum speed limits are usually regarded as fundamental restrictions, constraining the amount of computation that can be achieved within some given time and energy. Complementary to this intuition, here we show that these limitations are also of operational value: they enable the secure generation of certified randomness. We consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with some (experimentally determined or promised) upper bound on the energy uncertainty of the average prepared quantum state, but without any further assumptions on the devices, Hilbert space or Hamiltonian. Given that we can freely choose the time at which to apply the untrusted preparation procedure, we show that this scenario admits the generation of randomness that is secure against adversaries with additional classical information. We show how to determine the amount of certified randomness given the observed correlations, discuss how interactions with the environment are taken into account, and sketch a conceivable experimental implementation. In particular, we show that single-mode coherent states admit this kind of certification of non-zero randomness in some parameter regimes, reinforcing existing demonstrations of nonclassicality in the simple harmonic oscillator. Our results extend earlier efforts to devise semi-device-independent protocols grounded in reasonable physical assumptions, and they contribute to the understanding of time-energy uncertainty relations via their operational consequences.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule and under the additional assumptions of the integrability and unitarity of the Tomonaga-Schwinger dynamics and the foliation-independence of rays on acausal Cauchy hypersurfaces, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated precompact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures, where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the instantaneous-measurement idealisation, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. These results reaffirm the consistency of the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture of relativistic quantum theory, for which unitarity, integrability and foliation-independence of the states exclude superluminal signalling despite the ``instantaneity" of a side-cone measurement collapse rule. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal rectification via state-dependent two-photon dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling heat flow at the quantum level is essential for the development of next-generation thermal devices. We investigate thermal rectification in a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to two thermal baths via both single-photon (linear) and two-photon (nonlinear) exchange processes. At low temperatures, rectification arises from a state-dependent suppression of two-photon emission: when the cold bath dominates, it drives the oscillator into low-occupancy states, inhibiting emission and creating a thermal bottleneck. At higher temperatures, rectification is governed by the asymmetric scaling of higher-order moments associated with two-photon absorption and emission. We systematically explore various bath coupling configurations and identify the conditions under which nonlinear dissipation leads to directional heat flow. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on coupling an auxiliary two-level system to the oscillator, enabling effective two-photon dissipation. These results contribute to the understanding of quantum heat transport in the presence of nonlinear dissipation and may support future efforts in nanoscale thermal rectification design.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum tomography from incomplete measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit quantum tomography in an informationally incomplete scenario and propose improved state reconstruction methods using deep neural networks. In the first approach, the trained network predicts an optimal linear or quadratic reconstructor with coefficients depending only on the collection of (already taken) measurement operators. This effectively refines the undercomplete tomographic reconstructor based on pseudoinverse operation. The second, based on an LSTM recurrent network performs state reconstruction sequentially. It can also optimize the measurement sequence, which suggests a no-free-lunch theorem for tomography: by narrowing the state space, we gain the possibility of more efficient tomography by learning the optimal sequence of measurements. Numerical experiments for a 2-qubit system show that both methods outperform standard maximum likelihood estimation and also scale to larger 3- and 4-qubit systems. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively learn the underlying geometry of multi-qubit states using this for their reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing in capacitively coupled Kerr parametric oscillators using frequency-chirped drives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parametric oscillations of two capacitively coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with frequency-chirped two- and one-photon drives. The two-KPO system adiabatically evolves from the initial vacuum state to an oscillation state corresponding to a solution state in quantum-annealing applications. Frequency chirping dynamically changes the detuning between resonance and oscillation frequencies during parametric modulation and reduces unwanted population transfer to excited states caused by pure dephasing and photon loss. We observe that frequency chirping increases the success probability to obtain the solution state and that simulations taking into account pure dephasing reproduce experiments with and without frequency chirping. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of frequency chirping to a KPO-based quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Security of the BB84 protocol with passive biased basis choice by the receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol (BB84 protocol) is one of the simplest protocols for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD). In the protocol, the sender and the receiver iteratively choose one of two complementary measurement bases. Regarding the basis choice by the receiver, a passive setup has been adopted in a number of its implementations including satellite QKD and time-bin encoding one. However, conventional theoretical techniques to prove the security of BB84 protocol are not applicable if the receiver chooses his measurement basis passively, rather than actively, with a biased probability, followed by the measurement with threshold detectors. Here we present a fully analytical security proof against coherent attacks for such a decoy-state BB84 protocol with receiver's passive basis choice and measurement with threshold detectors. The numerical simulations under practical situations show that the difference in secure key rate between the active and the passive implementations of the protocol is negligible except for long communication distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a two-step protocol for quantum measurement tomography that is light on classical co-processing cost and still achieves optimal sample complexity in the system dimension. Given measurement data from a known probe state ensemble, we first apply least-squares estimation to produce an unconstrained approximation of the POVM, and then project this estimate onto the set of valid quantum measurements. For a POVM with $L$ outcomes acting on a $d$-dimensional system, we show that the protocol requires $\mathcal{O}(d^3 L \ln(d)/\epsilon^2)$ samples to achieve error $\epsilon$ in worst-case distance, and $\mathcal{O}(d^2 L^2 \ln(dL)/\epsilon^2)$ samples in average-case distance. We further establish two almost matching sample complexity lower bounds of $\Omega(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(d^2 L/\epsilon^2)$ for any non-adaptive, single-copy POVM tomography protocol. Hence, our projected least squares POVM tomography is sample-optimal in dimension $d$ up to logarithmic factors. Our method admits an analytic form when using global or local 2-designs as probe ensembles and enables rigorous non-asymptotic error guarantees. Finally, we also complement our findings with empirical performance studies carried out on a noisy superconducting quantum computer with flux-tunable transmon qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type van der Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques, we construct time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin squeezing, and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, significantly outperforming conventional quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states, opening pathways to enhanced quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>A Logic for Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial local observables and impermeable and permeable boundary conditions for 1D KFGM particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real solutions of the 1D Klein-Fock-Gordon (KFG) equation automatically cancel out the usual two-vector current density; consequently, the respective continuity equation is trivially satisfied, and a globally conserved quantity cannot be obtained. Additionally, distinguishing between impermeable and permeable boundary conditions (BCs) at a given point is not possible. We address these first-quantized conflicts by using the simplest nontrivial local observables, i.e., an energy density and an energy current density, which allows us to characterize a strictly neutral 1D KFG particle, i.e., a 1D KFG-Majorana (KFGM) particle, when it is confined to an interval and when it is restricted, e.g., in an interval with transparent walls. All the BCs for this system are extracted from the pseudo self-adjointness of the Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian plus two Majorana conditions. We show that these energy densities can satisfy a continuity equation; in addition, they lead to a conserved quantity for all available impermeable and permeable BCs. Moreover, the energy current density can characterize all available BCs. Despite this, the two-vector constructed with these two densities is not Lorentz covariant. In contrast, the commonly used energy current density -- a component of the energy-momentum tensor of the system -- cannot characterize all the BCs. Additionally, this quantity and its respective energy density -- another component of the energy-momentum tensor -- may not lead to a conserved quantity. However, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the BCs; thus, the abovementioned densities and those commonly used are equally satisfactory. For example, this occurs only for four impermeable BCs and a one-parameter set of permeable BCs. Our results highlight the important role played by the BCs when they are imposed on a system in which particles occupy a finite region.</description>

      <title>Numerical implementation of the partial secular approximation and unified master equation in structured open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is typically described through Lindblad equations, which are derived from the Redfield equation via the full secular approximation. The latter neglects the rotating terms in the master equation corresponding to pairs of jump operators with different Bohr frequencies. However, for many physical systems this approximation breaks down, and thus a more accurate treatment of the slowly rotating terms is required. Indeed, more precise physical results can be obtained by performing the partial secular approximation, which takes into account the relevant time scale associated with each pair of jump operators and compares it with the time scale arising from the system-environment coupling. In this work, we introduce a general code for performing the partial secular approximation in the Redfield equation for structured open quantum systems. The code can be applied to a generic Hamiltonian of any multipartite system coupled to bosonic baths. Moreover, it can also reproduce the unified master equation, which captures the same physical behavior as the Redfield equation under the partial secular approximation, but is mathematically guaranteed to generate a completely positive dynamical map. Finally, the code can compute both the local and global version of the master equation for the same physical problem. We illustrate the code by studying the steady-state heat flow in a structured open quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, each coupled to a bosonic mode, which in turn interacts with a thermal bath. The results in this work can be employed for the numerical study of a wide range of complex open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Time Symmetry, Retrocausality and the Emergent: Arrow of Time the Quantum Time-Symmetric Interpretation (QTSI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopic quantum laws are time-symmetric: nothing in the Schr\"odinger equation or its relativistic extensions distinguishes future from past. Yet measurements produce irreversible records, an apparently one-way causal flow, and the familiar notion that causes precede effects. Within the Quantum Time-Symmetric Interpretation (QTSI), this asymmetry is not fundamental but emergent. Isolated quantum systems are described by a two-component temporal state containing forward- and backward-propagating amplitudes. Their mixing, governed by a parameter $\Delta(\phi)$, defines a retrocausal coherence time $\tau_{RC}(\phi)$ beyond which advanced components are suppressed. As the system couples to amplifying environments characterized by a macroscopic parameter $\phi$, $\Delta(\phi)$ decreases and the backward component is dynamically eliminated, giving rise to classical causality and effective collapse. QTSI aligns naturally with time-symmetric approaches from Wheeler--Feynman, Aharonov, and Price, agrees with all weak-measurement and quantum eraser results in their operational regimes, and predicts specific signatures in temporal echoes and chaotic cavities. Detailed formal and experimental developments appear in the Supplementary Addenda.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a generic framework to bound the phase error rate for quantum key distribution protocols using passive detection setups with imperfections and memory effects. This framework can be used in proof techniques based on the entropic uncertainty relation or phase error correction, to prove security in the finite-size regime against coherent attacks. Our framework can incorporate on-the-fly announcements of click/no-click outcomes on Bob's side. In the case of imperfections without memory effects, it can be combined with proofs addressing source imperfections in a modular manner. We apply our framework to compute key rates for the decoy-state BB84 protocol, when the beam splitting ratio, the detection efficiency, and dark counts of the detectors are only known to be within some ranges. We also compute key rates in the presence of memory effects in the detectors. In this case, our results allow for protocols to be run at higher repetition rates, resulting in a significant improvement in the secure key generation rate.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), the quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues of a given Hermitian matrix and preparing its eigenvectors, is considered the most promising approach to finding the ground states and their energies of electronic systems using a quantum computer. It requires, however, to be warm--started from an initial state with sufficiently high overlap with the ground state. For strongly-correlated states, where QPE is expected to have advantage over classical methods, preparation of such initial states requires deep quantum circuits and/or expensive hybrid quantum-classical optimization. It is well-known that orbital-optimized paired Coupled Cluster Doubles (oo-pCCD) method can describe the static correlation features of many strongly correlated singlet states. We show that pCCD and its unitary counterpart, UpCCD, become equivalent in the limit of small amplitudes or if the number of large amplitudes is below 5. We demonstrate that substituting leading oo-pCCD amplitudes into the UpCCD Ansatz allows to prepare high-fidelity singlet states for models of multiple-bond dissociation in ethene, ethyne and dinitrogen, as well as for 1D Hubbard models at half-filling, with very shallow circuits. We envisage our method to be of general use for approximate preparation of singlet states for Quantum Phase Estimation and related algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards Compact Wavefunctions from Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent direction in quantum computing for molecular electronic structure sees the use of quantum devices as configuration sampling machines integrated within high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. This appeals to the strengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is classically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in the selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final molecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is therefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an algorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference perturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration subspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising 42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy curve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis set, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. We assess the resulting wavefunctions for compactness, a point on which QSCI has previously been criticised. At large separations, where static correlation dominates, we find a configuration space more than 200 times smaller than that obtained from a conventional SCI selection criterion yields comparable energies. We also compare against the best-in-class Heatbath Configuration Interaction algorithm and observe similar wavefunction compactness at convergence. This result is achieved with a configuration sampling scheme that uses the experimental orbital occupancies of a time-evolved quantum state to predict likely single and double excitations away from existing configurations to bias the subspace expansion procedure.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</description>

      <title>Introduction to modelling radical pair quantum spin dynamics with tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of energy barriers in the state space of a physical system can lead to exponentially slow convergence for sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In the classical setting, replica exchange (or parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a similar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time of quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue of the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of two replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of Hamiltonians with local energy barriers. We provide a rigorous lower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which leads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier height. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples, including the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and defected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature.</description>

Abstract: We present two complementary approaches to the GKSL equation for an open qubit. The first, based on linearity, yields solutions illustrated by mixed states trajectories in the Bloch ball, including non-random asymptotic fixed points, and exceptional points. The second, exploiting the SU(2) symmetry, leads to a nonlinear dynamical system that separates angular dynamics from radial dissipation. This symmetry-based perspective offers a promising route toward generalisation to open qudits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy for locally squeezed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.</description>

Abstract: Long distance entanglement generation at a high rate is a major quantum technological goal yet to be fully realized, with the promise of many interesting applications, such as secure quantum computing on remote servers and quantum cryptography. One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the foundational pillars of modern physics, yet experimental tests that combine the two frameworks remain rare. Measuring optical phase shifts of massless photons in a gravitational potential provides a unique quantum platform to probe gravity beyond Newtonian descriptions, but laboratory-based interferometers have not yet reached the sensitivity needed to access this regime. Here, we report the realization of a 50-km table-top Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer operating at the single-photon level, achieving a phase sensitivity of $4.42\times10^{-6}$ rad root-mean-square (RMS) within the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz. We demonstrate that this sensitivity is sufficient to resolve a phase-shift signal of $(6.18 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-5}$ rad RMS at 0.1 Hz, associated with a modulated gravity-induced signal. Our results establish a milestone for quantum sensing with large-scale optical interferometry, demonstrating the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, thereby paving the way for testing quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of electrically levitated nanoparticle-ion systems: Motional dynamics and sympathetic cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the Markovian approximation in the harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a central ingredient in the construction of quantum dynamics of Brownian motion which necessarily is non-Markovian. Yet, often Markovian approximations to quantum dynamics are studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate the limitations of the Markovian approximation within two paradigmatic models describing a single damped harmonic oscillator. These models are governed by distinct quantum Langevin equations, although both are constructed to satisfy the same set of phenomenological criteria: the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum, the Kubo response relation, the virial theorem, and the equilibrium quantum variance. The limitations of the Markovian approximation are underscored by the classical limit, violations of the Ehrenfest theorem, the breakdown of complete and simple positivity in the reconstructed master equations, and anomalies in thermalisation behaviour. Further phenomenological differences between the two models are illustrated through their quantum relaxation dynamics and phase diagrams, derived from their reinterpretation as mean-field approximations of a many-body interacting magnet. Our analysis explicitly reveals intrinsic inconsistencies introduced by the Markovian approximation, emphasising the need for non-Markovian frameworks for a consistent description of open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the theoretical description of the role of quantum geometry in superfluidity and superconductivity of multiband systems, with focus on flat bands where quantum geometry is wholly responsible for supercurrents. This review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of disordered planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</description>

      <title>Focused Sampling for Low-Cost and Accurate Ehrenfest Modeling of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An economic modeling approach for cavity quantum electrodynamics is provided by mean-field dynamics, wherein the optical field is described classically while a self-consistent interaction with quantum emitters is incorporated through the Ehrenfest theorem. However, conventional implementations of mean-field dynamics are known to suffer from a catastrophic leakage of zero-point energy, to lose accuracy in the short-cavity limit, and to require large numbers of trajectories to be sampled. Here, we address these three shortcomings within a single integrated approach. This approach builds on our recently-proposed modification of the Ehrenfest theorem, referred to as decoupled mean-field (DC-MF) dynamics, in combination with a focused sampling scheme that enforces zero-point energy at the single-trajectory level. The approach is shown to yield high accuracy in both short and long-cavity limits while reaching convergence within a minimal amount of trajectories.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding operation of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics characterized by an exotic nonlinear transformation, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in classifying non-Abelian Berry phases for braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy involves a reflection operation. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction with or without the aid of a controlled defect. The topological zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. We demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. Finally, we propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the validity of reflection positivity in the classification of invertible phases of quantum spin systems. We provide a mathematical model in which every 2d invertible state admits a reflection-positive representative. We prove that reflection positivity provides a canonical lift from the set of invertible phases to the set of invertible phases protected by a $\mathbb{Z}/N$-rotational symmetry. Using this, we define a refined version of the index recently introduced by the author. This refined version conjecturally provides a microscopic characterization of an invariant that coincides with the chiral central charge $c_-$ when conformal field theory effectively describes the boundary modes.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh--Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode in disordered superconductors, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity in dirty-limit superconductors can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit, i.e., the optical region. We present comprehensive details and method validation studies for our approach based on dipole imaginary-time autocorrelation functions. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we use the Drude model as the long-wavelength limit of the Lindhard response, presenting its analytical continuation into the imaginary time and Matsubara series. We demonstrate great agreement within $1\%$ between PIMC and the reference model, indicating negligible numerical biases and physical many-body effects in metallic densities. The approach is amenable to nonlinear optical response, quantum confinements, dispersion forces, and to inform applications such as plasmonics and epsilon-near-zero materials.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum entanglement with Generalized Parton Distributions at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the collinear factorization framework based on Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), we calculate the spin density matrix of exclusively produced quark and antiquark pairs $u\bar{u}$, $d\bar{d}$, $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, $b\bar{b}$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering. The presence of both real and imaginary parts in the GPD amplitudes leads to a rich pattern of entanglement between the quark and the antiquark. We map out kinematical regions where the pairs exhibit entanglement, Bell nonlocality and non-stabilizerness (`magic'). We also predict that massive quarks and antiquarks are transversely polarized, similar to the well-known transverse hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions. In strangeness, charm and bottom productions, the polarization can reach 50-80% in certain kinematic regions in the low-energy runs of the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

Abstract: We study a transport phenomenon in certain coined quantum walks where a subspace of states localized at a vertex gets transferred to another vertex. We first develop characterizations for perfect and pretty good subspace state transfer using the spectral properties of a Hermitian weighted digraph obtained from the underlying graph. We then provide a polynomial-time algorithm that tests whether pointwise perfect subspace state transfer occurs at an integer step, given that the subspace and coins are rational. Finally, we construct several infinite families of examples that admit pointwise perfect $d$-dimensional subspace state transfer where $d\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement degradation of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information science has been broadly explored in Einstein gravity and in various modified gravity theories; however, its extension to quantum gravity settings remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$, the mode frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\tilde{\zeta}$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of categorical symmetries in (Non-) Unitary Rational CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities without invoking any SymTFT construction, relying instead on a purely 2d RCFT analysis. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent dynamics of quasiclassical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.</description>

      <title>New quasi-exactly solvable systems from SUSYQM and Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a systematic construction of new quasi-exactly solvable systems via Bethe ansatz and supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM). Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schr\"odinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.</description>
