      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres--Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators which have the same polynomial factor. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.
  We also prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Delta as a Singular Potential for the 2D Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of distributionally generalized quantum theory, the object $H\psi$ is defined as a distribution. The mathematical significance is a mild generalization for the theory of para- and pseudo-differential operators (as well as a generalization of the weak eigenvalue problem), where the $\psi$-do symbol (which is not a proper linear operator in this generalized case) can have its coefficient functions take on singular distributional values. Here, a distribution is said to be singular if it is not L$^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any $p\geq 1$. Physically, the significance is a mathematically rigorous method, which does not rely upon renormalization or regularization of any kind, while producing bound state energy results in agreement with the literature. In addition, another benefit is that the method does not rely upon self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace operator. This is important when the theory is applied to non-Schrodinger systems, as is the case for the Dirac equation and a necessary property of any finite rigorous version of quantum field theory. The distributional interpretation resolves the need to evaluate a wave function at a point where it fails to be defined. For $d=2$, this occurs as $K_o(a|x|)\delta(x)$, where $K_o$ is the zeroth order MacDonald function. Finally, there is also the identification of a missing anomalous length scale, owing to the scale invariance of the formal symbol(ic) Hamiltonian, as well as the common identity for the logarithmic function, with $a,\,b\in\mathbb{R}^+$, $\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)$, which loses unitlessness in its arguments. Consequently, the energy or point spectrum is generalized as a family (set indexed by the continuum) of would-be spectral values, called the C-spectrum.</description>

      <title>Interface Modes in Honeycomb Topological Photonic Structures with Broken Reflection Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical theory for Dirac points and interface modes in honeycomb topological photonic structures consisting of impenetrable obstacles. Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining $120^\circ$-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the boundary integral equation method to show the existence of Dirac points for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone. We then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with Dirac points differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the Dirac points and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the quantum valley Hall effect in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay exponentially away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the zigzag interface, the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces. Using the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.</description>
