      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves and Laboratory Searches as Complementary Probes of Right-handed Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the damping of inflationary gravitational waves (GW) that re-enter the Hubble horizon before or during a post-inflationary era dominated by a meta-stable, right-handed neutrino (RHN), whose out-of-equilibrium decay releases entropy. Within a minimal type-I seesaw extension of the Standard Model (SM), we explore the conditions under which the population of thermally produced RHNs remain long-lived and cause a period of matter-domination. We find that the suppression of the GW spectrum occurs above a characteristic frequency determined by the RHN mass and active-sterile mixing. For RHN masses in the range $0.1$ - $10$ GeV and mixing $10^{-12} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-5}$, we estimate such characteristic frequencies and the signal-to-noise ratio to assess the detection prospects in GW observatories such as THEIA, $\mu$-ARES, LISA, BBO and ET. We find complementarity between GW signals and laboratory searches in SHiP, DUNE and LEGEND-1000. Notably, RHN masses of $0.2$ - $2$ GeV and mixing $10^{-10} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-7}$ are testable in both laboratory experiments and GW observations. Additionally, GW experiments can probe the canonical seesaw regime of light neutrino mass generation, a region largely inaccessible to laboratory searches.</description>

      <title>Light front holographic QCD theory in the generalized uncertainty principle framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop the framework of light-front holographic QCD in the presence of a minimal length scale by incorporating the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) into the QCD Lagrangian. From this modified theory, we derive a GUP-corrected light-front holographic QCD (LFH QCD) equation and obtain the corresponding hadronic mass spectrum. Our results show that the hadronic mass spectrum acquires an additional GUP-dependent term that increases the masses. This mass enhancement leads to significantly improved agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories from $S$- and $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^*$ interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the $S$- and $P$-wave interactions of the $D\bar{D}^*$ system within the framework of the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation, with the aim of exploring possible molecular states and their corresponding pole trajectories. The interaction potentials are constructed using the one-boson-exchange model, incorporating the exchanges of $\pi$, $\eta$, $\rho$, $\omega$, $\sigma$, and $J/\psi$ mesons, based on heavy quark effective Lagrangians. The poles of the scattering amplitude are analyzed and their evolution on two Riemann sheets is systematically traced as the cutoff parameter increases up to 5 GeV. We identify four molecular states arising from the $S$-wave $D\bar{D}^*$ interaction. Among them, the bound state with quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC}) = 0^+(1^{++})$ corresponds well to the experimentally observed $X(3872)$, while its isovector partner with $I^G(J^{PC}) = 1^-(1^{++})$ is found to exist only as a virtual state. Additionally, a $0^-(1^{+-})$ state appears as a bound state. The isovector $1^{+-}$ state, which may be associated with the $Z_c(3900)$, is observed to evolve from a bound state to a virtual state as the interaction strength decreases. For the $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^*$ interaction, the structure $G(3900)$ recently observed at BESIII is likely connected to a $0^-(1^{--})$ state. A $0^+(0^{-+})$ state is also predicted in this channel. Both can appear as either resonance or bound/virtual state depending on the interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Warm multi natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of parameters.</description>

      <title>Experimental Aspects of Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of modern physics, yet its possible violation remains both theoretically intriguing and experimentally significant. In this work, using quantum electrodynamics as an example, we explore how Lorentz invariance violation, introduced into a specific sector of the theory, spreads through loop corrections, modifying the propagation and dispersion relations of other particles. Self-energy and vacuum polarization graphs reveal how LIV effects transfer across sectors, influencing particle kinematics. Due to these loop effects, constraints from cosmic-ray observations and other Earth-based experiments impose limits on induced LIV parameters that would otherwise be less constrained. We show that while interaction-based LIV effects require unrealistically large parameters for detection, modifications to dispersion relations can be probed down to $\delta \sim 10^{-8} \text{ to } 10^{-9}$ at the LHC. This suggests that accelerator-based resonance studies provide a promising avenue for stringent LIV constraints, potentially rivaling astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of GRB data to test Lorentz-invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz-invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime serves as a critical probe for understanding quantum gravity phenomenology. Astrophysical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising avenue for testing LV-induced spectral lag phenomena; however, interpretations are complicated by degeneracies between LV effects and intrinsic emission delays. This study systematically investigates three competing time delay models: Model A (LV delay combined with a constant intrinsic delay), Model B (energy-dependent intrinsic delay without LV), and Model C (LV delay combined with energy-dependent intrinsic delay). We utilize mock GRB datasets generated under distinct delay mechanisms and employ Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated observations of 10 GRBs. Our findings demonstrate that Model C consistently recovers input parameters across all datasets. In contrast, Models A and B struggle to reconcile data generated under alternative mechanisms, particularly when confronted with high-energy TeV photons from GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A. Our analysis confirms that the incorporation of energy-dependent intrinsic delays in Model C is essential for establishing robust LV constraints, effectively resolving prior ambiguities in the interpretation of multi-GeV and TeV photon emissions. The results validate Model C as a generalized framework for future LV searches, yielding a subluminal LV scale of \(E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3 \times 10^{17}\) GeV based on realistic datasets. These findings are consistent with earlier constraints derived from Fermi-LAT datasets. This work underscores the necessity for joint modeling of LV and astrophysical emission processes in next-generation LV studies utilizing observatories such as LHAASO and CTA.</description>

      <title>Susceptibilities of conserved charges of hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective description of hadronic matter in terms of "effective free particles" is presented. Repulsive interactions among the hadrons have been modelled by Excluded volume correction by considering the hadrons as liquid drops, whose volume is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass of the species. The only adjustable parameter in the model is pion radius. We get better agreement to the lattice results as compared to the previous studies.</description>

      <title>Spin structure of spin-1 charmonium states near $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin structure of the $1^{--}$ and $1^{++}$ charmonium states near the critical temperature using QCD sum rules. To this end, we compute the contribution of the dimension-4 twist-2 gluon operator to the two-point function of heavy vector and axial vector currents in a rotating frame. As temperature increases, the quark spin contribution slightly increases, while the quark orbital angular momentum decreases by a comparable amount. The gluon contribution remains nearly unchanged. These thermal changes cancel each other, ensuring that the total spin is preserved even at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Doubly-charmed pentaquark states in a mass splitting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentrating on the mass differences relative to $P_{\psi}^{N}(4312)^+$, we systematically investigate the spectra of doubly-charmed pentaquark states in the compact $ccqq\bar{q}$ ($q=u, d, s$) configuration. The assumption that the observed $P_{\psi}^{N}(4312)^+$ is a compact hidden-charm pentaquark with $I(J^P)=\frac12(\frac32^-)$ is adopted. We also study the properties of strong decays within a simple rearrangement scheme. The results indicate that the $I(J^P)=\frac12(\frac12^-)$ $ccnn\bar{n}$ with $I_{nn}=0$ where $n$ denotes $u$ or $d$ quark, $I(J^P)=0(\frac12^-)$ $ccnn\bar{s}$, and $I(J^P)=0(\frac12^-)$ $ccns\bar{n}$ ground states should be stable.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Autodistillation in Baryon Pair Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin-entangled mixed state of a spin-1/2 baryon-antibaryon pair produced in the process e+e- to J/psi, psi(2S) to BBbar. We demonstrate that the spin entanglement of the system can increase following the decays B to b + M and Bbar to bbar + Mbar, where b and bbar are spin-1/2 baryons and M, Mbar are spin-0 mesons. This phenomenon, known as entanglement autodistillation, represents a probabilistic amplification of entanglement during the decay process. We analyze the underlying mechanism and show that it depends only on the initial state of the BBbar system and the decay parameter alphaD, but not on the phase parameter phiD.</description>

      <title>Searching for heavy vector-like B quark via pair production in fully hadronic channels at the CLIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector-like quarks (VLQs) are introduced in many new physics senarios beyond the Standard Model (SM) to address some problems faced by SM. In this paper, we explore the pair production of TeV-scale vector-like B quark (VLQ-$B$) at the future 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) in simplified effective lagrangian framework. We consider the decay modes of $B\rightarrow bZ$ and $B\rightarrow bh$ followed by hadronic decay of $Z$ and $h$ bosons. The large mass of VLQ-$B$ will induce highly boosted bosons $Z$ or $h$ which are more likely to form as fat-jets. By performing a rapid detector simulation of the signal and background events and clustering the jets with a large radius R, signal-background analyses are carried out. And the exclusion limit at the 95\% confidence level and the 5$\sigma$ discovery prospects are obtained with an integrated luminosity of 5$\text{ab}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>New rare meson decay constraints on a light vector in $U(1)_{B-L}, U(1)_R$ and the dark photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate constraints from flavor changing rare meson decays to a light vector boson $X$, followed by the decay of the on-shell $X$ into the SM fermions. The flavor changing meson decay emitting the light $X$ is induced by loop processes where the up-type quarks, the $W$ boson, or charged scalar bosons are running inside loops. We calculate all one-loop diagrams with neglecting all masses of light quarks except for the top quark in a general anomaly free extra $U(1)$ model. Our theoretical evaluation of the branching ratio of charged $B$ meson decay and charged kaon decay is compared to experimental results, and we derive new constraints for dark photon, $U(1)_{B-L}$ and $U(1)_R$ models.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Matter Potential at One-Loop Level on Neutrino Oscillations in Long-Baseline Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that one-loop corrections to the matter potential for neutrino oscillations can significantly impact the sensitivity to neutrino mass ordering in long-baseline accelerator experiments. Using numerical simulations for the future experiment DUNE, we find that the statistical significance for excluding the incorrect mass ordering can be enhanced by $1.0\sigma$--$1.2\sigma$ if a one-loop correction of $5.8\%$ -- predicted by the Standard Model in the on-shell renormalization scheme -- is included. Even with a smaller correction of $2.0\%$, based instead on the Fermi coupling constant $G^{}_\mu$ derived from measurements of muon lifetime, we show that the enhancement remains notable at about $0.4\sigma$. In contrast, the sensitivity to leptonic CP violation in DUNE is essentially unchanged. Finally, we emphasize that one-loop corrections should be incorporated into analyses of future neutrino oscillation data in a consistent and systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics Through CP Violation in $B_{(s)}\to V\mu^+\mu^-$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare decays of the kind $B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B_s\to \phi\mu^+\mu^-$ are key players for testing the Standard Model. The current experimental data for their decay rates and angular observables show tensions with the theoretical predictions that may be indications of New Physics. We present a strategy to extract the relevant short-distance coefficients in the presence of new sources of CP violation, utilizing a synergy with $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. Using the current data as a guideline, we illustrate the new method to determine the complex coefficients $C_9^{(\prime)}$ and $C_{10}^{(\prime)}$ using only four angular observables. Interestingly, the current experimental picture leaves significant room for CP-violating New Physics. We discuss also the link to leptonic $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. We are looking forward to the implementation of these strategies at the future high-precision frontier of flavour physics.</description>

      <title>Non-Renormalizable SU(5) GUTs: Leptoquark-Induced Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the doublet-triplet splitting problem within the $SU(5)$ gauge group framework to advocate a viable regime with the light scalar leptoquark of the doublet-triplet splitting notoriety that is compatible with the current experimental bounds on partial proton decay lifetimes. We explicitly demonstrate, through a consistent use of higher-dimensional operators, how to implement suppression of baryon number violating interactions of the aforementioned color triplet. Our study thus offers an alternative approach to the doublet-triplet splitting problem as it removes a need for an extreme mass hierarchy between the partners residing in the same representation. We furthermore pursue two different extensions of two distinct symmetry breaking scenarios of $SU(5)$, one with a $24$-dimensional representation and the other one with a $75$-dimensional representation, to produce comparative study of novel consequences for the gauge coupling unification and the one-loop level neutrino mass generation. Our results point towards qualitatively novel $SU(5)$ scenarios, where the light scalar leptoquarks, responsible for the neutrino mass generation, might be even accessible at colliders and thus serve as an accelerator accessible portal to the high-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Linking the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event to Dark Matter Decay and Gravitational Waves Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino event, dubbed KM3-230213A. This is the first observed neutrino event with energy of the order of $\mathcal{O}(100)$PeV, the origin of which remains unclear. We interprete this high energy neutrino event results from the Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) $\chi$ decay through the right-handed (RH) neutrino portal assuming the Type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses and mixings. Fruthermore, dark matter $\chi$ is assumed to charged under $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, which is sponetaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of the dark Higgs $\Phi$. In this scenario, the DM can decay into a pair of Standard Model (SM) particles for $v_\Phi \gg m_\chi$, which we assume is the case. If the DM mass is around $440$ PeV with a lifetime $5\times 10^{29}$ sec, it can account for the KM3-230213A event. However, such heavy DM cannot be produced through the thermal freeze-out mechanism due to overproduction and violation of unitarity bounds. We focus on the UV freeze-in production of DM through a dimension-5 operator, which helps in producing the DM dominantly in the early Universe. We have also found a set of allowed parameter values that can correctly account for the DM relic density and decay lifetime required to explain the KM3NeT signal. Moreover, we have generated the neutrino spectra from the two-body decay using the HDMSpectra package, which requires the dark Higgs vacuum expectations value (VEV) to be much larger than the DM mass. Finally, the large value of the dark Higgs field VEV opens up the possibility of generating GW spectra from cosmic strings. We have found a reasonable set of parameter values that can address the KM3NeT signal, yield the correct value of the DM relic density through freeze-in mechanism, and allow for possible detection of GW at future detectors.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning and Metaheuristics for Feynman Integral Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new methods for optimizing the integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals, an important computational bottleneck in modern perturbative calculations in quantum field theory. Using the simple example of one-loop massive bubble integrals, we pose the problem of minimizing the number of arithmetic operations in reducing a target integral to master integrals via the Laporta algorithm. This is a nontrivial combinatorial optimization problem over the ordering of IBP equation generation (from pairs of seed integrals and IBP operators) and the ordering of integral elimination. Our first proposed method is reinforcement learning, which involves an agent interacting with an environment in a step-by-step manner and learning the best actions to take given an observation of the environment (in this case, the current state of the IBP reduction process). The second method is using metaheuristics, e.g. simulated annealing, to minimize the computational cost as a black-box function of numerical priority values that control the orderings. For large-scale problems, the number of free parameters can be compressed by using a small neural network to assign priority values. Remarkably, both methods lead to IBP reduction schemes that are more efficient than human-designed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Modeling frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern resonant sensing tools can achieve increasingly high quality factors, which correspond to extremely narrow linewidths. In such systems, time-variation of the resonator's natural frequency can potentially impact its ability to accumulate power and its resulting sensitivity. One such example is the Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with quality factors of $Q\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of the cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with amplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a large suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the effects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing the Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of jittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely, when the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates power as if there were no jittering at all. In the case of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\sim 10\%$ loss in power. Our results imply that the dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run can potentially be refined to be an order of magnitude stronger. We also study the impact of jittering on the sensitivity of resonant experiments more broadly. Interestingly, we find that, depending on the nature of the relevant noise sources, jittering can actually enhance the sensitivity by introducing distinct spectral features into the response of the system. In future work, we will explore how resonant experiments may benefit from introducing frequency modulation into their system.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.</description>

      <title>Discovering $\mu$Hz gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter with binary resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a weak gravitational wave (GW) background, astrophysical binary systems act as high-quality resonators, with efficient transfer of energy and momentum between the orbit and a harmonic GW leading to potentially detectable orbital perturbations. In this work, we develop and apply a novel modeling and analysis framework that describes the imprints of GWs on binary systems in a fully time-resolved manner to study the sensitivity of lunar laser ranging, satellite laser ranging, and pulsar timing to both resonant and nonresonant GW backgrounds. We demonstrate that optimal data collection, modeling, and analysis lead to projected sensitivities which are orders of magnitude better than previously appreciated possible, opening up a new possibility for probing the physics-rich but notoriously challenging to access $\mu\mathrm{Hz}$ frequency GWs. We also discuss improved prospects for the detection of the stochastic fluctuations of ultra-light dark matter, which may analogously perturb the binary orbits.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Extended Parameter Space with DESI DR2 BAO: A 2$\sigma$+ Detection of Non-zero Neutrino Masses with an Update on Dynamical Dark Energy and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain constraints in a 12 parameter cosmological model using the recent DESI Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra (Planck Public Release (PR) 4) and lensing (Planck PR4 + Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release (DR) 6) data, uncalibrated type Ia Supernovae (SNe) data from Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL: DES Year 1) data. The cosmological model consists of six $\Lambda$CDM parameters, and additionally, the dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\textrm{eff}}$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\textrm{lens}}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). Our major findings are the following: i) With CMB+BAO+DESY5+WL, we obtain the first 2$\sigma$+ detection of a non-zero $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.19^{+0.15}_{-0.18}$ eV (95%). Replacing DESY5 with Pantheon+ still yields a $\sim$1.9$\sigma$ detection. ii) The cosmological constant lies at the edge of the 95% contour with CMB+BAO+Pantheon+, but is excluded at 2$\sigma$+ with DESY5, leaving evidence for dynamical dark energy inconclusive, contrary to claims by DESI collaboration. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, $A_{\textrm{lens}} = 1$ is excluded at $&gt;2\sigma$, while it remains consistent with unity without WL data - suggesting for the first time that the existence of lensing anomaly may depend on non-CMB datasets. iv) The Hubble tension persists at 3.6-4.2$\sigma$ with CMB+BAO+SNe; WL data has minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Universality of entanglement in gluon dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement of fundamental degrees of freedom in particle physics is generated ab initio in scattering processes. In the case of a pure $SU(N)$ gauge theory, two gluons in a product state can be entangled in their polarizations as the result of three- and four-gluon vertex interactions. We find that entanglement is only produced when the initial product state have opposite polarizations, and that maximal entanglement is generated when the outgoing particles form an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ with respect to the incoming ones. A surprising result is that the amount of entanglement among gluon polarizations is independent of the gauge group at any angle and, thus, of the color degree of freedom. Universality of entanglement for any gauge group emerges. It is also found that a small deviation of the relative weight between three- and four-gluon vertices would prevent the generation of maximal entanglement. This can be seen as a small piece of a possible it from qubit principle underlying fundamental interactions, that is a principle that requires physics to be quantum in origin.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way, FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.</description>

      <title>Minimal Magnetogenesis: The Role of Inflationary Perturbations and ALPs, and Its Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the present universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For large-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not necessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary magnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In this paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field is generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal coupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these primordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the small amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between this large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass $&lt;10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the photon decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark age, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the axion-photon coupling parameter $\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale magnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic resonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique spectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the upcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be sufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\alpha \lesssim 80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day magnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at $\Mpc$ scale, consistent with observation.</description>

      <title>Angular structure of many-body correlations in atomic nuclei: From nuclear deformations to diffractive vector meson production in $\gamma A$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that high-energy scattering processes involving nuclei can offer unique insights into the many-body correlations present in nuclear ground states, in particular those of deformed nuclei. These processes involve, for instance, the collective anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions, or the diffractive production of vector mesons in photo-nuclear ($\gamma A$) interactions. In this paper, we use a classical approximation and simple analytical models in order to exhibit characteristic and universal features of ground-state correlation functions that result from the presence of a deformed intrinsic state. In the case of a small axial quadrupole deformation, we show that the random rotation of the intrinsic density of the nucleus leads to a specific quadrupole modulation of the lab-frame two-body density as a function of the relative azimuthal angle. As a phenomenological, albeit academic application, we analyze the diffractive production of vector mesons in high-energy $\gamma+^8$Be collisions. This demonstrates with the simplest deformed nucleus how the two-body correlations impact the $|t|$ dependence of the incoherent cross sections.</description>

Abstract: Renaud Parentani has given a vast contribution to the development of gravitational analogue models as tools to explore various important aspects of general relativity and of quantum field theory in curved space-time. In these systems, two-point correlation functions are of the utmost importance for the characterization of processes taking place close to the acoustic horizon. In the present paper, dedicated to him, we present a study of path integral methods that allow to determine two-point correlation functions by a perturbative expansion, in a way that -- beyond its generality -- is especially suited to analyze these processes. Our results apply to non-relativistic superfluids, realizable in terrestrial experiments, as well as to relativistic superfluids, relevant for compact stellar objects.</description>

Abstract: There are evidences that the properties of the hadrons are modified in a nuclear medium. Information about the medium modifications of the internal structure of the hadrons are fundamental for the study of dense nuclear matter and high energy processes including heavy-ion and nucleus-nucleus collisions. At the moment, however, the empirical information about the medium modifications of the hadrons is limited, therefore, theoretical studies are essential for the progress in the field. In the present work we review theoretical studies of the electromagnetic and axial form factors of octet baryons in symmetric nuclear matter. The calculations are based on a model that takes into account the degrees of freedom revealed on experimental studies of the low and intermediate square transfer momentum $q^2=-Q^2$: valence quarks and meson cloud excitations of the baryon cores. The formalism combines a covariant constituent quark model, developed for the free space (vacuum) with the quark-meson coupling model for the extension to the nuclear medium. We conclude that the nuclear medium modifies the baryon properties differently according to the flavor content of the baryons and the medium density. The effects of the medium increase with the density, and are stronger (quenched or enhanced) for light baryons than for heavy baryons. In particular, the in-medium neutrino-nucleon and antineutrino-nucleon cross sections are reduced compared to the values in free space. The proposed formalism can be extended to densities above the normal nuclear density and applied to neutrino-hyperon and antineutrino-hyperon scattering in dense nuclear matter.</description>

Abstract: J-PARC E05 reported recently a hint of a $\Xi^--{^{11}{\rm B}}$ nuclear state in the ${^{12}}{\rm C}(K^-,K^+){^{12}_{\Xi}}{\rm Be}$ spectrum, bound by $B_{\Xi^-}=8.9\pm 1.4 {^{+3.8}_{-3.1}}$ MeV. Using a density-dependent $\Xi$-nuclear optical potential $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$ we explore to what extent a $\Xi^-_{1s}$ assignment of this nuclear state is compatible with $\Xi^-_{1s}$ and $\Xi^-_{1p}$ nuclear-state interpretations of $\Xi^-$ capture events in light emulsion-nuclei experiments. We find that the only acceptable $\Xi^-_{1s}$ assignment at present, barring an abnormally strong repulsive $\rho^2$ component of $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$, is that for the $\Xi^--{^{11}{\rm B}}$ signal. This finding supports reassigning $\Xi^-$ capture events in $^{14}$N, originally assigned as $\Xi^-_{1s}-{^{14}{\rm N}}$ nuclear states, to $\Xi^0_{1p}-{^{14}{\rm C}}$ nuclear states. The depth of $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho)$ at nuclear-matter density $\rho_0=0.17$ fm$^{-3}$ is then $V_{\rm opt}^{\Xi}(\rho_0)\sim 21$ MeV (attractive).</description>

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}E$ and fallback rate $\mathrm{d}M/\mathrm{d}T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>RGUP Corrections to Scalar and Fermionic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Relativistic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (RGUP) effects on scalar and fermionic fields using the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation. Modified equations of motion, Hamiltonians, and stress-energy tensors are derived in Minkowski spacetime, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections that ensure a minimal observable length and revert to standard dynamics when corrections are absent. For fermionic fields in curved spacetime, spin connections maintain gravitational consistency. This framework, applicable to high-energy physics, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmology, integrates quantum gravity into relativistic field theories.</description>

      <title>Sub-Horizon Amplification of Curvature Perturbations: A New Route to Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), also referred to as scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). This process also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant approach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period -- marking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection points or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we challenge the conventional assumption that $\epsilon_2 \lesssim -6$ is a prerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can indeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth, establishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification. Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs. To illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is embedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying $\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the amplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs production, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological missions.</description>

      <title>Increase of $n_s$ in regularized pole inflation &amp; Einstein-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the regularization of the second order pole in the pole inflation can induce the increase of $n_s$, which may be important after the latest data release of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Pole inflation is known to provide a unified description of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for inflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a larger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs inflation, and the $\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the modification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second order pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for all field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the large field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this type of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan formalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT data without spoiling the success of the $\alpha$-attractor models.</description>

      <title>Towards the finite quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.07195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel regularization/renormalization scheme that utilizes an auxiliary Feynman parameterization. This approach is employed to align a specified loop diagram with a designated unit of the form $1=\lambda/\lambda$. Within the proposed regularization technique, we formulate the standard renormalization scheme and demonstrate conditions under which it yields symmetry preserving results. It is demonstrated that its minimal form yields renormalized diagrams that are equivalent to those of the dimensional renormalization scheme, with the exception of their counterterms. Furthermore, a novel procedure for taking the soft limit $\lambda\rightarrow 0$, where a properly defined order of computational actions provides the field theory completely finite, is presented.The qualitative and quantitative distinctions between this approach and the standard scheme are highlighted. Both schemes are elucidated in the scalar model in 3+1D for pedagogical reasons. Subsequently, the proposed schemes are applied to the Standard Model at one loop level, e.g. we calculate photon and gluon polarizations. QCD effective charge is calculated in the finite QCD, exhibiting a clear evidence that the finite QCD is not ruled out but supported by experiment. In the final section, we offer a concise discussion on the softening of anomalies and the treatment of overlapping divergences, accompanied by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Exploring hidden sectors with two-particle angular correlations at future $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future $e^+e^-$ colliders are called to play a fundamental role in measuring Standard Model (SM) parameters with unprecedented precision and discovering physics beyond the SM (BSM). This study scrutinises two-particle angular correlation distributions involving final-state SM charged hadrons. Unexpected correlation structures in these distributions could be a hint for new physics perturbing the QCD partonic cascade and modifying azimuthal and (pseudo)rapidity correlation. Using \textsc{Pythia8} and detector fast simulation tools we study unexpected structures arising in the two-particle angular correlation function, including selection cuts and detector effects. We have chosen the QCD-like Hidden Valley (HV) scenario as implemented in \textsc{Pythia8}, with relatively light $v$-quarks ($\lesssim 100$~GeV), to illustrate the potential of this method.</description>

Abstract: We present MAPPDFpol1.0, a new determination of the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton from a set of longitudinally polarised inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering data. The determination includes, for the first time, next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to both processes, and is carried out in a framework that combines a neural-network parametrisation of PDFs with a Monte Carlo representation of their uncertainties. We discuss the quality of the determination, in particular its dependence on higher-order corrections, on the choice of data set, and on theoretical constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose symbolic regression as a powerful tool for studying Beyond the Standard Model physics. As a benchmark model, we consider the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which has a four-dimensional parameter space defined at the GUT scale. We provide a set of analytical expressions that reproduce three low-energy observables of interest in terms of the parameters of the theory: the Higgs mass, the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the cold dark matter relic density. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we employ the symbolic expressions in a global fits analysis to derive the posterior probability densities of the parameters, which are obtained extremely rapidly in comparison with conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: We show that various nucleon "radii" that appear in the literature, e.g."charge", "gravitational", "mass" or "mechanical, do not have a direct geometric meaning and do not give an idea of the physical size of the nucleon.
  In the framework of the Gribov parton scheme we also show that at high enough energy a gluon cloud appears beyond the valence core of the nucleon and begins to determine the region of interaction of elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering and the growth of its cross-section.</description>

      <title>Detecting meV-Scale Dark Matter via Coherent Scattering with an Asymmetric Torsion Balance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter with mass in the crossover range between wave dark matter and particle dark matter, around $(10^{-3},\, 10^3)\,$eV, remains relatively unexplored by terrestrial experiments. In this mass regime, dark matter scatters coherently with macroscopic objects. The effect of the coherent scattering greatly enhances the accelerations of the targets that the dark matter collisions cause by a factor of $\sim 10^{23}$. We propose a novel torsion balance experiment with test bodies of different geometric sizes to detect such dark matter-induced acceleration. This method provides the strongest constraints on the scattering cross-section between the dark matter and a nucleon in the mass range $(10^{-3}, 1)\,$eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of domain walls arising from non-Abelian discrete symmetries, which we refer to as non-Abelian domain walls. We focus on $S_4$, one of the most commonly used groups in lepton flavour mixing models. The spontaneous breaking of $S_4$ leads to distinct vacua preserving a residual $Z_2$ or $Z_3$ symmetry. Five types of domain walls are found, labelled as SI, SII, TI, TII, and TIII, respectively, the former two separating $Z_2$ vacua and the latter three separating $Z_3$ vacua. We highlight that SI, TI and TIII may be unstable for some regions of the parameter space and decay to stable domain walls. Stable domain walls can collapse and release gravitational radiation for a suitable size of explicit symmetry breaking. A symmetry-breaking scale of order 100 TeV may explain the recent discovery of nanohertz gravitational waves by PTA experiments. For the first time, we investigate the properties of these domain walls, which we obtain numerically with semi-analytical formulas applied to compute the tension and thickness across a wide range of parameter space. We estimate the resulting gravitational wave spectrum and find that, thanks to their rich vacuum structure, non-Abelian domain walls manifest in a very interesting and complex phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations for the hadronic VVA correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive two types of dispersion relations for the hadronic vector-vector-axial-vector (VVA) correlator: one in generic three-point kinematics with fixed photon virtualities, the second in the kinematic limit of one soft photon. The VVA correlator enters in the electroweak contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and it also emerges as the leading term in the operator-product expansion for hadronic light-by-light scattering in the limit of two large photon momenta. Previously, this correlator was only described in terms of hadronic models. Our new dispersive treatments are in analogy to the established and the newly proposed dispersive approaches to hadronic light-by-light. The VVA correlator allows us to investigate the relation between the two types of dispersion relations in a simpler example and to elucidate the reshuffling of different hadronic contributions in this comparison. As a byproduct, we reduce the theoretical uncertainties on the first-family VVA contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment by combining the dispersive representation with both asymptotic and low-energy constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singlet scalar dark matter (DM) model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM). This model features only two free parameters: the singlet scalar mass $m_S$ and the quartic coupling $a_2$ between the singlet scalar and the SM Higgs doublet. Previous studies have suggested that only the resonant region remains viable under combined constraints. In this work, we revisit and refine the constraints using data from the direct detection experiment LZ, invisible Higgs decay measurements, and gamma-ray line observations conducted by Fermi-LAT and DAMPE. Our findings indicate that the latest results from LZ have significantly strengthened the constraints on the model parameters. We demonstrate that only a narrow parameter region remains viable, specifically $60.5\,\text{GeV}&lt; m_S &lt; 62.5\,\text{GeV}$ and $1.7\times10^{-4}&lt;a_2&lt; 4.7\times10^{-4}$. This suggests that a three-fold improvement in the current LZ results would thoroughly examine the parameter space below $1\,\rm{TeV}$ for the singlet scalar DM model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The system of light electroweakinos and heavy squarks gives rise to one of the most challenging signatures to detect at the LHC. It consists of missing transverse energy recoiled against a few hadronic jets originating either from QCD radiation or squark decays. The analysis generally suffers from the large irreducible Z + jets $(Z \to \nu \bar \nu)$ background. In this study, we explore Machine Learning (ML) methods for efficient signal/background discrimination. Our best attempt uses both reconstructed (jets, missing transverse energy, etc.) and low-level (particle-flow) objects. We find that the discrimination performance improves as the pT threshold for soft particles is lowered from 10 GeV to 1 GeV, at the expense of larger systematic uncertainty. In many cases, the ML method provides a factor two enhancement in $S/\sqrt{(S + B)}$ from a simple kinematical selection. The sensitivity on the squark-elecroweakino mass plane is derived with this method, assuming the Run-3 and HL-LHC luminosities. Moreover, we investigate the relations between input features and the network's classification performance to reveal the physical information used in the background/signal discrimination process.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the Belle and LHCb data on the interference of the amplitudes of the $S$ and $D$ partial waves in the decays $D_{s1}(2536 )^+\to D^{*+}K^0_S$ and $D_{s1}(2536)^-\to\bar D^{*0}K^-$ allow us to obtain an estimate of the $S$-wave $D^*K$ scattering length in the channel with isospin $I=0$: $|a^{(0)}_{D^*K}|=(0.94\pm0.06)$ fm. The possibility of explaining the found value by the contribution of the $D_{s1}(2460)$ resonance is discussed. The decay of $B_{s1}(5830)\to B^*\bar K$ is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A tale of $Z$+jet: SMEFT effects and the Lam-Tung relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive constraints on dimension-six light-quark dipole operators within the Standard Model (SM) effective field theory, based on measurements of $Z$ production at SLC and LEP, as well as $Z$+jet production at the LHC. Our new constraints exclude the parameter space that could potentially explain the observed discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental data for the Lam-Tung relation. With these updated limits, we model-independently determine the maximum possible influence that beyond-SM contributions could have on the angular coefficients $A_0$ and $A_2$, which enter the Lam-Tung relation.</description>

      <title>On the EFT validity for Drell-Yan tails at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the validity range of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) description of high-energy Drell-Yan processes at the LHC. To this purpose, we consider explicit mediators that contribute to these processes in the $s$- and $t$-channels, comparing their effects in Drell-Yan distributions with the ones obtained by matching onto the corresponding EFT. We determine the conditions for the EFT results to accurately describe these scenarios. In particular, we explore the impact of including dimension-eight $(d=8)$ operators in the faster convergence of the EFT series, at the analytical and numerical level, considering contributions to the cross section up to the square of $d=8$ EFT operator insertions. Moreover, we discuss the possible implications of clipping LHC data and illustrate results for a specific New-Physics scenario motivated by low-energy flavor data.</description>

      <title>Precise Predictions for Event Shapes in Diphoton Production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon pair production is an important benchmark process at the LHC, entering Higgs boson studies and new physics searches. It has been measured to high accuracy, allowing for detailed studies of event shapes in diphoton final states. To enable precision physics with diphoton event shapes, we compute the second-order QCD corrections, ${\cal O} (\alpha_s^3)$, to them and study their phenomenological impact.</description>

      <title>'t Hooft model in the temporal gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider QCD$_2$ in the $N_c \to \infty$ limit at fixed $g^2N_c$. The derivation starts from equal-time $q\bar q$ bound states in coordinate space and temporal ($A^0=0$) gauge, avoiding the use of quark and gluon propagators. The wave function is given analytically by a $_1F_1$ function with an explicit frame dependence. In the infinite momentum frame the Fourier transformed wave function satisfies the 't~Hooft equation, however with contributions also from quarks with negative kinetic energy. Such contributions are present also in the rest frame, and do not vanish under boosts.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Chiral Magnetic Effect in the heavy-ion collisions using AVFD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework is utilized to generate $^{197}_{79}Au+^{197}_{79}Au$, $^{96}_{44}Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$, and $^{96}_{40}Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$ collision events at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). The CME signal is modulated through the axial charge per entropy density ($n_5/s$) in each event to produce data sets with varying CME signal strengths. Additionally, a 33$\%$ local charge conservation (LCC) is implemented in each event. These data sets are analyzed using CME-sensitive two- and three-particle correlators. Furthermore, the Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) is employed to identify potential CME-like events within each data set. The identified events selected using the SDM exhibit characteristics consistent with CME. The CME fraction in these events is quantified while accounting for background contributions.</description>

Abstract: We present a two-loop analysis of the contributions to Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion arising from the triple-gluon operator in the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT). Our discussion covers all aspects of renormalization group (RG) improved perturbation theory, including matching and running within the SMEFT. This study can therefore be seen as a blueprint of the intricacies and subtleties that arise in RG improved SMEFT calculations for collider processes beyond the leading order.</description>

      <title>Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognised earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</description>

      <title>A two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-component dark matter model with $Z_2 \times Z_4$ symmetry, where a singlet scalar $S$ and a Majorana fermion $\chi$ are introduced as dark matter candidates. We also introduce another singlet scalar $S_0$ with a non-zero vacuum expectation value to the SM so that the fermion dark matter can obtain mass after spontaneous symmetry breaking. We have a new Higgs boson in the model and in the case of the decoupling limit, the fermion dark matter production is only determined by $S$ and the new Higgs boson. The mass hierarchy of these new particles can make a difference in the reaction rate of dark matter annihilation processes, contributing to different viable parameter spaces for different mass orderings. We randomly scanned the parameter space with six various cases under relic density constraint and found that when $\chi$ is the lightest among the dark sector, $\chi$ production is generated via the so-called forbidden channels. Moreover, we consider the combined limits arising from Higgs invisible decay, dark matter relic density and direct detection constraints. Within the chosen parameter space, direct detection results put the most stringent constraint, and we have a more flexible value for the scalar dark matter mass when the mass of $\chi$ is not smaller than the new Higgs boson mass.</description>

      <title>An analysis on doubly bottom molecular tetraquarks composed of $H_{(s)}$ and $T_{(s)}$ doublets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the doubly bottom $H_{(s)}\bar{T}_{(s)}$ and $H_{(s)}T_{(s)}$ systems by adopting the one-boson-exchange model, where $H_{(s)}$ and $T_{(s)}$ represent $S$-wave $B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ and $P$-wave $B^{(*)}_{(s)1,2}$ doublets, respectively. For the $H\bar{T}$ systems, we predict some loosely bound states in the $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{-\pm})$ $B\bar{B}_{1}$, $I(J^{PC})=0(2^{--})$ $B\bar{B}_{2}^{*}$, $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{-\pm})$ $B^*\bar{B}_{1}$ and $I(J^{PC})=0(2^{-\pm})$ $B^*\bar{B}_{2}^{*}$ channels, which are the most promising hidden bottom molecular tetraquarks. For the $HT$ systems, the $I(J^{P})=0(1^{-})$ $B^*B_1$ and $I(J^{P})=0(2^{-})$ $B^{*}B^{*}_2$ channels are also likely to form molecular tetraquarks. In contrast, no molecular candidates have been identified in the bottom-strange sectors. One can hope that our predictions will provide valuable insights to the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations as they continue to explore this fascinating field through experimental research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.</description>

      <title>Polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs: generative machine learning applications for lattice QCD matrix elements at short distance and large momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations share a defining challenge by requiring a small finite range of spatial separation $z$ between quark/gluon bilinears for controllable power corrections in the perturbative QCD factorization, and a large hadron boost $p_z$ for a successful determination of collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs). However, these two requirements make the determination of PDFs from lattice data very challenging. We present the application of generative machine learning algorithms to estimate the polarized and unpolarized gluon correlation functions utilizing short-distance data and extending the correlation up to $zp_z \lesssim 14$, surpassing the current capabilities of lattice QCD calculations. We train physics-informed machine learning algorithms to learn from the short-distance correlation at $z\lesssim 0.36$ fm and take the limit, $p_z \to \infty$, thereby minimizing possible contamination from the higher-twist effects for a successful reconstruction of the polarized gluon PDF. We also expose the bias and problems with underestimating uncertainties associated with the use of model-dependent and overly constrained functional forms, such as $x^\alpha(1-x)^\beta$ and its variants to extract PDFs from the lattice data. We propose the use of generative machine learning algorithms to mitigate these issues and present our determination of the polarized and unpolarized gluon PDFs in the nucleon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open string amplitudes at tree level have been studied for over fifty years, but there is no known analytic form for general $n$-point amplitudes, and their conventional representation in terms of worldsheet integrals does not make many of their most basic physical properties manifest. Recently, a formulation of these amplitudes exposing the underlying "binary geometry" via the use of "$u$" variables has given us many insights into their basic features. In this paper, we initiate a systematic exploration of fundamental aspects of open string amplitudes from this new point of view. We begin by giving explicit expressions for the factorization of amplitudes at general massive levels. We then study the asymptotic behavior when subsets of kinematic variables become large, delineating regimes with exponential (generalized hard scattering) and power-law (generalized Regge) behavior. We also give precise expressions for the asymptotics, which reveal another example of the recently observed property of factorization away from poles. We finally derive new recursion relations and infinite series representations for the amplitude, and for five points, we present a new closed-form expression for the amplitude that for the first time gives its analytic continuation to all of kinematic space.</description>

      <title>A proposal for removing $\pi N$-state contamination from the nucleon induced pseudoscalar form factor in lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the PACS10 project, the PACS collaboration has generated three sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\;{\rm fm})^4$ and three different lattice spacings. The isovector nucleon form factors had been already calculated by using two sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations. In our strategy, the smearing parameters of the nucleon interpolation operator were highly optimized to eliminate as much as possible the contribution of excited states in the nucleon two-point function. This strategy was quite successful in calculations of the electric ($G_E$), magnetic ($G_M$) and axial-vector ($F_A$) form factors, while the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) and pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors remained strongly affected by residual contamination of $\pi N$-state contribution. In this work, we propose a simple method to remove the $\pi N$-state contamination from the $F_P$ form factor, and then evaluate the induced pseudoscalar charge $g_P^\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{\pi NN}$ from existing data in a new analysis. Applying this method to the $G_P$ form factor is also considered with a help of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in QCD influence nucleon structure and interactions, with pion production serving as a key probe of chiral dynamics. In this study, we present a lattice QCD calculation of multipole amplitudes at threshold, related to both pion electroproduction and weak production from a nucleon, using two gauge ensembles near the physical pion mass. We develop a technique for spin projection and construct multiple operators for analyzing the generalized eigenvalue problem in both the nucleon-pion system in the center-of-mass frame and the nucleon system with nonzero momentum. The numerical lattice results are then compared with those extracted from experimental data and predicted by low-energy theorems incorporating one-loop corrections.</description>

Abstract: We present a measurement of the production of $\Xi^-$ and $\Lambda\Lambda$ in the $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+)$ reaction at an incident beam momentum of 1.8 GeV/$\mathit{c}$, based on high-statistics data from J-PARC E42. The cross section for the $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+\Xi^-)$ reaction, compared to the inclusive $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+)$ reaction cross section, indicates that the $\Xi^-$ escaping probability peaks at 70\% in the energy region of $E_\Xi=$100 to 150 MeV above the $\Xi^-$ emission threshold. A classical approach using eikonal approximation shows that the total cross sections for $\Xi^-$ inelastic scattering ranges between 42 mb and 23 mb in the $\Xi^-$ momentum range from 0.4 to 0.6 GeV/c. Furthermore, based on the relative cross section for the $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+\Lambda\Lambda)$ reaction, the total cross section for $\Xi^-p\to\Lambda\Lambda$ is estimated in the same approach to vary between 2.2 mb and 1.0 mb in the momentum range of 0.40 to 0.65 GeV/c. Specifically, a cross section of 1.0 mb in the momentum range of 0.5 to 0.6 GeV/c imposes a constraint on the upper bound of the decay width of the $\Xi^-$ particle in infinite nuclear matter, revealing $\Gamma_\Xi&lt; \sim 0.6$ MeV.</description>
