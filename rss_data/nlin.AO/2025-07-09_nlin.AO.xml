      <title>Average Action Efficiency Rises Monotonically in Self-Organizing Systems via Stochastic Least-Action Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-organizing systems convert noisy motion into efficient structure, yet a universal, dimensionless measure of this transformation is lacking. We derive the Average Action Efficiency (AAE) - events per total action - from a stochastic path-integral least-action principle. A Lyapunov identity links its monotonic rise to the action variance and the rate of noise reduction, defining growth, saturation, and decay regimes. Agent-based ant foraging and single-molecule ATP-synthase data confirm the predicted sigmoidal rise and plateau. Because AAE needs only an event count and an integrated action, it offers a lightweight metric and design rule for feedback-controlled self-organization across physics, chemistry, biology, and active matter.</description>

      <title>An AI Theory of Mind Will Enhance Our Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective intelligence plays a central role in many fields, from economics and evolutionary theory to neural networks and eusocial insects, and is also core to work on emergence and self-organisation in complex-systems theory. However, in human collective intelligence there is still much to understand about how specific psychological processes at the individual level give rise to self-organised structures at the social level. Psychological factors have so far played a minor role in collective-intelligence studies because the principles are often general and applicable to agents without sophisticated psychologies. We emphasise, with examples from other complex adaptive systems, the broad applicability of collective-intelligence principles, while noting that mechanisms and time scales differ markedly between cases. We review evidence that flexible collective intelligence in human social settings is improved by a particular cognitive tool: our Theory of Mind. We then hypothesise that AIs equipped with a theory of mind will enhance collective intelligence in ways similar to human contributions. To make this case, we step back from the algorithmic basis of AI psychology and consider the large-scale impact AI can have as agential actors in a 'social ecology' rather than as mere technological tools. We identify several key characteristics of psychologically mediated collective intelligence and show that the development of a Theory of Mind is crucial in distinguishing human social collective intelligence from more general forms. Finally, we illustrate how individuals, human or otherwise, integrate within a collective not by being genetically or algorithmically programmed, but by growing and adapting into the socio-cognitive niche they occupy. AI can likewise inhabit one or multiple such niches, facilitated by a Theory of Mind.</description>
