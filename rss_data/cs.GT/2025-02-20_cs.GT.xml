      <title>How to Sell a Service with Uncertain Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent popularity of machine learning training services, we introduce a contract design problem in which a provider sells a service that results in an outcome of uncertain quality for the buyer. The seller has a set of actions that lead to different distributions over outcomes. We focus on a setting in which the seller has the ability to commit to an action and the buyer is free to accept or reject the outcome after seeing its realized quality. We propose a two-stage payment scheme where the seller designs a menu of contracts, each of which specifies an action, an upfront price and a vector of outcome-dependent usage prices. Upon selecting a contract, the buyer pays the upfront price, and after observing the realized outcome, the buyer either accepts and pays the corresponding usage price, or rejects and is exempt from further payment. We show that this two-stage payment structure is necessary to maximize profit: only upfront prices or only usage prices is insufficient. We then study the computational complexity of computing a profit-maximizing menu in our model. While computing the exact maximum seller profit is NP-hard even for two buyer types, we derive a fully-polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the maximum profit for a constant number of buyer types. Finally, we prove that in the single-parameter setting in which buyers' valuations are parametrized by a single real number that seller revenue can be maximized using a menu consisting of a single contract.</description>

      <title>Diversity-seeking swap games in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schelling games use a game-theoretic approach to study the phenomenon of residential segregation as originally modeled by Schelling. Inspired by the recent increase in the number of people and businesses preferring and promoting diversity, we propose swap games under three diversity-seeking utility functions: the binary utility of an agent is 1 if it has a neighbor of a different type, and 0 otherwise; the difference-seeking utility of an agent is equal to the number of its neighbors of a different type; the variety-seeking utility of an agent is equal to the number of types different from its own in its neighborhood. We consider four global measures of diversity: degree of integration, number of colorful edges, neighborhood variety, and evenness, and prove asymptotically tight or almost tight bounds on the price of anarchy with respect to these measures on both general graphs, as well as on cycles, cylinders, and tori that model residential neighborhoods. We complement our theoretical results with simulations of our swap games starting either from random placements of agents, or from segregated placements. Our simulation results are generally consistent with our theoretical results, showing that segregation is effectively removed when agents are diversity-seeking; however strong diversity, such as measured by neighborhood variety and evenness, is harder to achieve by our swap games.</description>

      <title>Tell Me Why: Incentivizing Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common sense suggests that when individuals explain why they believe something, we can arrive at more accurate conclusions than when they simply state what they believe. Yet, there is no known mechanism that provides incentives to elicit explanations for beliefs from agents. This likely stems from the fact that standard Bayesian models make assumptions (like conditional independence of signals) that preempt the need for explanations, in order to show efficient information aggregation. A natural justification for the value of explanations is that agents' beliefs tend to be drawn from overlapping sources of information, so agents' belief reports do not reveal all that needs to be known. Indeed, this work argues that rationales-explanations of an agent's private information-lead to more efficient aggregation by allowing agents to efficiently identify what information they share and what information is new. Building on this model of rationales, we present a novel 'deliberation mechanism' to elicit rationales from agents in which truthful reporting of beliefs and rationales is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Concentration and maximin fair allocations for subadditive valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fair allocation of $m$ indivisible items to $n$ agents of equal entitlements, with submodular valuation functions. Previously, Seddighin and Seddighin [{\em Artificial Intelligence} 2024] proved the existence of allocations that offer each agent at least a $\frac{1}{c \log n \log\log n}$ fraction of her maximin share (MMS), where $c$ is some large constant (over 1000, in their work). We modify their algorithm and improve its analysis, improving the ratio to $\frac{1}{14 \log n}$.
  Some of our improvement stems from tighter analysis of concentration properties for the value of any subadditive valuation function $v$, when considering a set $S' \subseteq S$ of items, where each item of $S$ is included in $S'$ independently at random (with possibly different probabilities). In particular, we prove that up to less than the value of one item, the median value of $v(S')$, denoted by $M$, is at least two-thirds of the expected value, $M \geq \frac{2}{3}\E[v(S')] - \frac{11}{12}\max_{e \in S} v(e)$.</description>

      <title>On the Subsidy of Envy-Free Orientations in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fair division problem in (multi)graphs where $n$ agents (vertices) are pairwise connected by items (edges), and each agent is only interested in its incident items. We consider how to allocate items to incident agents in an envy-free manner, i.e., envy-free orientations, while minimizing the overall payment, i.e., subsidy. We first prove that computing an envy-free orientation with the minimum subsidy is NP-hard, even when the graph is simple and the agents have bi-valued additive valuations. We then bound the worst-case subsidy. We prove that for any multigraph (i.e., allowing parallel edges) and monotone valuations where the marginal value of each good is at most \$1 for each agent, \$1 each (a total subsidy of $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of agents) is sufficient. This is one of the few cases where linear subsidy $\Theta(n)$ is known to be necessary and sufficient to guarantee envy-freeness when agents have monotone valuations. When the valuations are additive (while the graph may contain parallel edges) and when the graph is simple (while the valuations may be monotone), we improve the bound to $n/2$ and $n-2$, respectively. Moreover, these two bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Hedonic Games with Enemy-Oriented Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hedonic games model settings in which a set of agents have to be partitioned into groups which we call coalitions. In the enemy aversion model, each agent has friends and enemies, and an agent prefers to be in a coalition with as few enemies as possible and, subject to that, as many friends as possible. A partition should be stable, i.e., no subset of agents prefer to be together rather than being in their assigned coalition under the partition. We look at two stability concepts: core stability and strict core stability. This yields several algorithmic problems: determining whether a (strictly) core stable partition exists, finding such a partition, and checking whether a given partition is (strictly) core stable. Several of these problems have been shown to be NP-complete, or even beyond NP. This motivates the study of parameterized complexity. We conduct a thorough computational study using several parameters: treewidth, number of friends, number of enemies, partition size, and coalition size. We give polynomial algorithms for restricted graph classes as well as FPT algorithms with respect to the number of friends an agent may have and the treewidth of the graph representing the friendship or enemy relations. We show W[1]-hardness or para-NP-hardness with respect to the other parameters.
  We conclude this paper with results in the setting in which agents can have neutral relations with each other, including hardness-results for very restricted cases.</description>

      <title>Quantile agent utility and implications to randomized social choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a novel direction in randomized social choice by proposing a new definition of agent utility for randomized outcomes. Each agent has a preference over all outcomes and a {\em quantile} parameter. Given a {\em lottery} over the outcomes, an agent gets utility from a particular {\em representative}, defined as the least preferred outcome that can be realized so that the probability that any worse-ranked outcome can be realized is at most the agent's quantile value.
  In contrast to other utility models that have been considered in randomized social choice (e.g., stochastic dominance, expected utility), our {\em quantile agent utility} compares two lotteries for an agent by just comparing the representatives, as is done for deterministic outcomes.
  We revisit questions in randomized social choice using the new utility definition. We study the compatibility of efficiency and strategyproofness for randomized voting rules, efficiency and fairness for randomized one-sided matching mechanisms, and efficiency, stability, and strategyproofness for lotteries over two-sided matchings. In contrast to well-known impossibilities in randomized social choice, we show that satisfying the above properties simultaneously can be possible.</description>

      <title>Simplifying imperfect recall games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In games with imperfect recall, players may forget the sequence of decisions they made in the past. When players also forget whether they have already encountered their current decision point, they are said to be absent-minded. Solving one-player imperfect recall games is known to be NP-hard, even when the players are not absent-minded. This motivates the search for polynomial-time solvable subclasses. A special type of imperfect recall, called A-loss recall, is amenable to efficient polynomial-time algorithms. In this work, we present novel techniques to simplify non-absent-minded imperfect recall games into equivalent A-loss recall games. The first idea involves shuffling the order of actions, and leads to a new polynomial-time solvable class of imperfect recall games that extends A-loss recall. The second idea generalises the first one, by constructing a new set of action sequences which can be "linearly combined" to give the original game. The equivalent game has a simplified information structure, but it could be exponentially bigger in size (in accordance with the NP-hardness). We present an algorithm to generate an equivalent A-loss recall game with the smallest size.</description>

      <title>Two Tickets are Better than One: Fair and Accurate Hiring Under Strategic LLM Manipulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of increasingly capable foundation models, job seekers are turning to generative AI tools to enhance their application materials. However, unequal access to and knowledge about generative AI tools can harm both employers and candidates by reducing the accuracy of hiring decisions and giving some candidates an unfair advantage. To address these challenges, we introduce a new variant of the strategic classification framework tailored to manipulations performed using large language models, accommodating varying levels of manipulations and stochastic outcomes. We propose a ``two-ticket'' scheme, where the hiring algorithm applies an additional manipulation to each submitted resume and considers this manipulated version together with the original submitted resume. We establish theoretical guarantees for this scheme, showing improvements for both the fairness and accuracy of hiring decisions when the true positive rate is maximized subject to a no false positives constraint. We further generalize this approach to an $n$-ticket scheme and prove that hiring outcomes converge to a fixed, group-independent decision, eliminating disparities arising from differential LLM access. Finally, we empirically validate our framework and the performance of our two-ticket scheme on real resumes using an open-source resume screening tool.</description>

      <title>Restricting Entries to All-Pay Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08104v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an all-pay contest in which players with low abilities are filtered out before competing for prizes. We consider a setting where the designer admits a certain number of top players. The admitted players update their beliefs based on the signal that their abilities are among the top, which leads to posterior beliefs that, even under i.i.d. priors, are correlated and depend on each player's private ability. We find that all effects of this elimination mechanism -- including the reduction in the number of admitted players and the resulting updated beliefs -- are captured by an inflated ability. A symmetric and strictly increasing equilibrium strategy exists if and only if this inflated ability is increasing in the player's true ability. Under this condition, we explicitly characterize the unique strictly increasing Bayesian equilibrium strategy. Focusing on a winner-take-all prize structure, we find that each admitted player's effort strictly decreases as the admitted number increases. As a result, it is optimal to admit only two players in terms of maximizing the expected highest effort. Finally, in a two-stage extension, we find that there does not exist a symmetric and strictly increasing equilibrium strategy.</description>

      <title>T\^atonnement in Homothetic Fisher Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A prevalent theme in the economics and computation literature is to identify natural price-adjustment processes by which sellers and buyers in a market can discover equilibrium prices. An example of such a process is t\^atonnement, an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by French economist Walras in which sellers adjust prices based on the Marshallian demands of buyers. A dual concept in consumer theory is a buyer's Hicksian demand. In this paper, we identify the maximum of the absolute value of the elasticity of the Hicksian demand, as an economic parameter sufficient to capture and explain a range of convergent and non-convergent t\^atonnement behaviors in a broad class of markets. In particular, we prove the convergence of t\^atonnement at a rate of $O((1+\varepsilon^2)/T)$, in homothetic Fisher markets with bounded price elasticity of Hicksian demand, i.e., Fisher markets in which consumers have preferences represented by homogeneous utility functions and the price elasticity of their Hicksian demand is bounded, where $\varepsilon \geq 0$ is the maximum absolute value of the price elasticity of Hicksian demand across all buyers. Our result not only generalizes known convergence results for CES Fisher markets, but extends them to mixed nested CES markets and Fisher markets with continuous, possibly non-concave, homogeneous utility functions. Our convergence rate covers the full spectrum of nested CES utilities, including Leontief and linear utilities, unifying previously existing disparate convergence and non-convergence results. In particular, for $\varepsilon = 0$, i.e., Leontief markets, we recover the best-known convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, and as $\varepsilon \to \infty$, e.g., linear Fisher markets, we obtain non-convergent behavior, as expected.</description>

      <title>Words are not Wind -- How Public Joint Commitment and Reputation Solve the Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To achieve common goals, we often use joint commitments. Our commitment helps us to coordinate with our partners and assures them that their cooperative efforts will benefit themselves. However, if one of us can exploit the other's cooperation (as in the Prisoner's Dilemma), our commitment appears less useful. It cannot remove the temptation for our partners to exploit us. Using methods from evolutionary game theory, we study the function of joint commitments in the Prisoner's Dilemma. We propose a reputation system akin to indirect reciprocity, wherein agents observe interactions even when not directly involved. They judge cooperation as good and defection as bad, but, crucially, only if the parties involved had committed to cooperate. This results in stable cooperation even though judgments are made privately, which had been a weakness in previous models of indirect reciprocity. Our work shows that joint commitments have utility beyond coordination problems, which could explain their prevalence. The proposed link between joint commitments and reputation could also explain why some joint commitments are pointedly public, like wedding vows. A reputation-based mechanism might have been particularly relevant in our distant past, in which no institutions existed to enforce commitments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Satisfying MXS and EFL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two standard fairness notions in the resource allocation literature are proportionality and envy-freeness. If there are n agents competing for the available resources, then proportionality requires that each agent receives at least a 1/n fraction of their total value for the set of resources. On the other hand, envy-freeness requires that each agent weakly prefers the resources allocated to them over those allocated to any other agent. Each of these notions has its own benefits, but it is well known that neither one of the two is always achievable when the resources being allocated are indivisible. As a result, a lot of work has focused on satisfying fairness notions that relax either proportionality or envy-freeness. In this paper, we focus on MXS (a relaxation of proportionality) and EFL (a relaxation of envy-freeness). Each of these notions was previously shown to be achievable on its own [Barman et al.,2018, Caragiannis et al., 2023], and our main result is an algorithm that computes allocations that simultaneously satisfy both, combining the benefits of approximate proportionality and approximate envy-freeness. In fact, we prove this for any instance involving agents with valuation functions that are restricted MMS-feasible, which are more general than additive valuations. Also, since every EFL allocation directly satisfies other well-studied fairness notions like EF1, 1/2-EFX, 1/2-GMMS, and 2/3-PMMS, and every MXS allocation satisfies 4/7-MMS, the allocations returned by our algorithm simultaneously satisfy a wide variety of fairness notions and are, therefore, universally fair [Amanatidis et al., 2020].</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Fisher Market Equilibrium and First-Price Pacing Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear Fisher market (LFM) is a basic equilibrium model from economics, which also has applications in fair and efficient resource allocation. First-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) is a model capturing budget-management mechanisms in first-price auctions. In certain practical settings such as advertising auctions, there is an interest in performing statistical inference over these models. A popular methodology for general statistical inference is the bootstrap procedure. Yet, for LFM and FPPE there is no existing theory for the valid application of bootstrap procedures. In this paper, we introduce and devise several statistically valid bootstrap inference procedures for LFM and FPPE. The most challenging part is to bootstrap general FPPE, which reduces to bootstrapping constrained M-estimators, a largely unexplored problem. We devise a bootstrap procedure for FPPE under mild degeneracy conditions by using the powerful tool of epi-convergence theory. Experiments with synthetic and semi-real data verify our theory.</description>
