      <title>Fracture Properties of Green Nano Fibrous Network with Random and Aligned Fibre Distribution: A Hierarchical Molecular Dynamics and Peridynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polylactic acid (PLA) nanofibrous networks have gained substantial interest across various engineering and scientific disciplines, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and filtration, due to their unique and multifunctional attributes, including biodegradability, tunable mechanical properties, and surface functionality. However, predicting their mechanical behaviour remains challenging due to their structural complexity, multiscale features, and variability in material properties. This study presents a hierarchical approach to investigate fracture phenomena in both aligned and randomly oriented nanofibrous networks by integrating atomistic modelling and nonlocal continuum mechanics, namely peridynamics. At the nanoscale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are employed to apply tensile loads to freestanding pristine and silver-doped PLA nanofibres, where key mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and critical energy release rate are determined. A new method is introduced to transfer data from molecular dynamics to peridynamics by ensuring convergence of the tensile response of a single fiber in both frameworks. This nano-to-micro coupling technique is then used to examine the Young's modulus, fracture toughness in modes I and II, and crack propagation in PLA nanofibrous networks. The proposed framework can also incorporate the effects of surface coating and fiber arrangements on the measured properties. This research paves the way for the development of stronger and more durable eco-friendly nanofibrous networks with optimised performance.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A generalized framework for automated discovery of interpretable inelastic material models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key problem of solid mechanics is the identification of the constitutive law of a material, that is, the relation between strain and stress. Machine learning has lead to considerable advances in this field lately. Here we introduce inelastic Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (iCKANs). This novel artificial neural network architecture can discover in an automated manner symbolic constitutive laws describing both the elastic and inelastic behavior of materials. That is, it can translate data from material testing into corresponding elastic and inelastic potential functions in closed mathematical form. We demonstrate the advantages of iCKANs using both synthetic data and experimental data of the viscoelastic polymer materials VHB 4910 and VHB 4905. The results demonstrate that iCKANs accurately capture complex viscoelastic behavior while preserving physical interpretability. It is a particular strength of iCKANs that they can process not only mechanical data but also arbitrary additional information available about a material (e.g., about temperature-dependent behavior). This makes iCKANs a powerful tool to discover in the future also how specific processing or service conditions affect the properties of materials.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of the Long-Time Asymptotics of the Diffusion Spreadability of Two-Phase Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent diffusion spreadability $\mathcal{S}(t)$ is a powerful dynamical probe of the microstructure of two-phase heterogeneous media across length scales [Torquato, S., \emph{Phys. Rev. E.}, 104 054102 (2021)]. It has been shown that when the spectral density takes the power-law form $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})\sim |\mathbf{k}|^\alpha$ as the wavenumber $|\mathbf{k}|$ tends to zero, the normalized excess spreadability $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ [proportional to $\mathcal{S}(\infty)-\mathcal{S}(t)$] scales as $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)\sim t^{-\frac{d+\alpha}{2}}$ in the long-time limit $t\to\infty$, enabling one to determine the infinite-wavelength scaling exponent $\alpha$. An algorithm that allows one to reliably extract the exponent $\alpha$ from long-time spreadability data was previously devised [Wang, H., Torquato, S., \emph{Phys. Rev. Appl.}, 17 034022 (2022)]. In this paper, we further improve this procedure to obtain $\alpha$ even more accurately by incorporating higher-order correction terms to the long-time asymptotics and by utilizing analyticity properties of $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$ at the origin. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing hyperuniform ($\alpha&gt; 0$), typical nonhyperuniform ($\alpha=0$), and antihyperuniform ($-d &lt; \alpha &lt;0$) models of two-phase media. In addition, by combining the large-$t$ asymptotic expansion of $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ with the small-$t$ expansion, we have devised a two-point Pad\'e approximant to approximate $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ for all $t$ with just a few parameters. Our findings facilitate the characterization of the microstructure of two-phase media across length scales as obtained from numerical spreadability data or experimental data obtained from NMR relaxation measurements. Our work can also be applied in the inverse design of two-phase microstructures with targeted spreadability behaviors.</description>

      <title>Leveraging mechanical resonances for the selection of promising materials in complex phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "high-entropy" paradigm has been applied to a central challenge in materials science, the design of new functional materials with enhanced performance for targeted applications, with some notable successes over the last twenty years. However, the immensity of the high-entropy design space remains a major impediment to discovering optimal compositions with tailored microstructures. Suites of high-throughput computational tools have been developed to address this problem, but there is a compelling need to inform these models with fast, economical, non-destructive, and versatile experimental guidance. In this work, we demonstrate mechanical resonance measurements can address this need. Mechanical resonance measurements enable the rapid, non-destructive assessment of materials created by novel syntheses and/or processes and provide high-accuracy determinations of elastic constants to directly benchmark models. We exemplify these capabilities on W-Ta-Cr-V-Hf and Mo-Nb-Ti-V-Zr refractory high-entropy alloys and suggest methodologies for the wider adoption and application of mechanical resonance measurements.</description>

      <title>El Agente S\'olido: A New Age(nt) for Solid State Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry calculations are a key component of the materials discovery process. The results from first-principles explorations enable the prediction of material properties prior to experimental validation. Despite their impact, the practical use of first-principles methods remains limited by the expertise required to design, execute, and troubleshoot complex computational workflows. Even when workflows are successfully built, they are sometimes rigid and not adaptable to different use cases. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems offer a pathway to flexibly automate these processes and lower barriers to entry. Here, we introduce El Agente S\'olido, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for automating solid-state quantum chemistry workflows using the open-source Quantum ESPRESSO simulation package. The framework translates high-level scientific objectives expressed in natural language into end-to-end computational pipelines that include structure generation, input file construction, workflow execution, and post-processing analysis. El Agente S\'olido integrates density functional theory with phonon calculations and machine-learning interatomic potentials to enable efficient and physically consistent simulations. Extensive benchmarking and case studies demonstrate that El Agente S\'olido reliably executes a wide range of solid-state calculations, highlighting its potential to improve reproducibility and accelerate computational materials discovery</description>

      <title>Ab initio Monte Carlo prediction of order-to-disorder transitions in multicomponent MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter predicts unprecedented order-to-disorder transition behaviors in multicomponent MXenes using an integrated and improved first-principles Monte Carlo (MC) framework. The improvements include (i) structural relaxation and (ii) selective atom swapping during MC iterations for more accurate and efficient predictions. Using (TiMo)-based double transition metal (DTM) carbide MXenes as a model system, ab initio MC simulations reveal that surface termination and coordination environments play critical roles in governing chemical ordering in MXenes. Specifically, the formation of out-of-plane MXene (o-MXenes) with Mo segregation to outermost metallic layers (M') is only driven by the oxygen (O) termination at prismatic sites. In contrast, O termination at octahedral sites and fluorine (F) termination at both prismatic and octahedral sites always promote the formation of o-MXenes with Ti-segregated to M' layers. Furthermore, changing the F/O ratio at prismatic termination sites or alternating the atomic coordination within the MXene lattices can induce an order-to-disorder transition in DTM MXenes.</description>

      <title>Efficient photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products with Pt1-xPdxSn4 Dirac Nodal Arc Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photochemical CO2 reduction reaction represents a zero-carbon pathway for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals, yet its industrial implementation has been constrained by low selectivity and product diversity. Dirac nodal arc semimetals characterized by ultrahigh carrier mobility with over 25000 cm2 V-1 s-1 offer a promising platform to search for efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion. Herein, we demonstrate that strategic Pt incorporation into PdSn4 optimizes the electronic structure and carrier dynamics of this Dirac semimetal. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the resulting Pd-Sn-Pt local electronic structure redistributes charge density around Pd and Pt atoms, which facilitates C-C coupling via *OC-COH and *OC-CHOH intermediates and enhances carrier mobility by 40% versus the pristine PdSn4 single crystal. The optimized Pd0.4Pt0.6Sn4 single crystal achieves C2H4 with formation rate of 0.000328 mol g-1 h-1, product selectivity of 73.1% and electron-based selectivity of 89%. This work establishes electronic-structure-tunable Dirac semimetals as a new paradigm for multi-carbon photochemical CO2 reduction, providing a design strategy for next-generation photocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Irradiation-Driven Recrystallization in Fusion-Grade Tungsten: A Mesoscale, Microstructure-Aware Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten (W) is the leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in fusion reactors, yet its upper operational temperature is limited by premature grain growth and recrystallization processes. Irradiation adds further complications by generating defect clusters and transmutation products that alter both the driving forces and kinetics of grain boundary motion. In this work, we develop a physics-based, multiscale framework that couples crystal plasticity, stochastic cluster dynamics, and discrete grain boundary dynamics to model the co-evolution of plastic deformation, irradiation damage, and grain growth in fusion-grade tungsten polycrystals. The approach enables simulations on realistic microstructures with arbitrary grain size and misorientation distributions, without recourse to mean-field simplifications. The model captures (i) the spatial heterogeneity of dislocation density distribution during hot working; (ii) irradiation-induced defect accumulation under fusion conditions, and (iii) the buildup of chemical and elastic driving forces for grain boundary migration and microstructural evolution. Parametric studies demonstrate the dominant influence that temperature has on thermally activated grain-boundary mobility, a weaker dependence on prior strain, and a pronounced retardation of recrystallization by rhenium segregation arising from neutron transmutation. Under fusion energy irradiation conditions, our framework predicts a substantial reduction of the effective recrystallization temperature relative to unirradiated microstructures, while Re production restores and even elevates this limit. By providing quantitative projections of recrystallization kinetics and in-service recrystallization temperatures, this work establishes a predictive tool for assessing the lifetime and operational envelope of W-based plasma-facing materials under fusion conditions.</description>

      <title>Lattice and Orbital-Resolved Fermiology of Metallenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes have emerged as a new member of the two-dimensional (2D) materials family. Recent experimental realization of metallenes in the {\AA}ngstr\"om limit has further intensified interest in this class of 2D materials. However, achieving sub-atomic insight into them demands the most detailed and systematic characterization of their electronic structure. Such understanding is essential for the rational design and exploitation of their properties in plasmonics, catalysis, and quantum optics. Existing electronic-structure studies are either scattered or focus on a few selected systems, and a comprehensive view of their band structures and Fermi surfaces remains missing. Here, we address this gap by studying 45 elemental metallenes in six monolayer lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled forms) using density-functional theory. We found that lattice type primarily fixes the shape and radial placement of the Fermi-lines, while out-of-plane buckling introduces controlled modifications: it shortens long straight Fermi-line segments, and occasionally creates, removes, or merges small Fermi-line pockets. The electronic configuration determines which orbital type dominates the Fermi level. We summarized Fermiology using a single score for each element, termed pocketness, derived from four descriptors that combine element properties (symmetry, coordination) with electronic characteristics (dispersion, Fermi-surface topology). This score enables targeted angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) tests, controlled Lifshitz transitions, and provides a predictive basis for transport and device applications.</description>

      <title>Achieving Robust Extrapolation in Materials Property Prediction via Decoupled Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized materials property prediction, yet fails catastrophically when extrapolating beyond training distributions-precisely the capability required for discovering unprecedented materials. Graph neural networks (GNNs) exhibit this collapse because end-to-end training fundamentally couples learned representations to target property distributions, preventing genuine extrapolation. We demonstrate that decoupled transfer learning-separating pretrained GNN feature extractors from simple regressors-overcomes this barrier. Pretrained features provide transferable structural knowledge, while simple regressors enable smooth extrapolation by maintaining learned trends beyond training boundaries. Benchmarked on layered intercalation compounds through four rigorous extrapolation scenarios and a temporal Materials Project split, our framework achieves 68% error reduction (RMSE: 0.881 vs. 2.778 eV/atom) versus end-to-end GNNs for extrapolation. Failure analysis reveals extrapolation succeeds for continuous chemical space but fails for discontinuous space, establishing clear design principles. Validated on Fermi energy prediction, this framework is immediately deployable using existing pretrained models, requiring no architectural innovations-transforming ML-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Physical Pictures for Quasisymmetry in Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) provides a novel route to understand and control near-degeneracies, Berry curvature, optical selection rules, and symmetry-protected phenomena in quantum materials. Here we give physical interpretations of the emergence of QS operators across multiple material families. Using density functional theory and the $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ formalism, we identify QS subspaces and calculate their representation matrices, quantifying the quasisymmetry via a metric $\epsilon$ that measures subspace invariance. For Sn/SiC and transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers, QS corresponds to an emergent mirror symmetry, whereas in wurtzite crystals it manifests as an emergent spatial inversion. By contrast, for AgLa the QS appearing in avoided crossings is inherited from a nearby high-symmetry point rather than being an emergent lattice symmetry. Combining group-theoretical analysis and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ modeling, our results establish concrete physical pictures for QS and provide practical criteria to diagnose it in first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Second-Coordination-Sphere Cation Substitution as a Tool for Controlling Phase Transitions and Performance of the Luminescence Thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the exceptionally high relative sensitivities achieved by luminescent thermometers based on first-order structural phase transitions, their principal limitation lies in the inherently narrow thermal operating range associated with the transition temperature. In this work, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Li+ by Na+ ions in the second coordination sphere of Eu3+ ions in LiYO2 enables a substantial shift of the phase transition temperature, thereby allowing controlled optimization of the thermometric performance. This approach represents a significantly more cost-effective and efficient strategy for tuning the phase transition temperature compared with the previously proposed substitution of Y3+ by other lanthanide ions. Importantly, we show that lowering the transition temperature through Na+ incorporation simultaneously introduces static compositional disorder and local lattice strain. As a consequence, the enthalpy difference between the competing structural phases decreases, and the cooperativity of the lattice distortion is reduced, indicating a gradual weakening of the first-order character of the phase transition. Our results demonstrate that such structural modifications, while effective in shifting the transition temperature, inevitably lead to a reduction in the relative sensitivity of phase-transition-based luminescent thermometers.</description>

      <title>A Computational Study of Organic Molecular Crystals for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic crystalline materials are potential candidates for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS). Although organic crystals have been heavily investigated for application in organic electronics, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and solar cells, there have been comparatively fewer studies into OWS in these materials. A major challenge is the large number of electronic and structural criteria that must be met for a material to make a viable OWS photocatalyst. Optical absorption, reduction and oxidation potentials and charge-transport properties are among the key considerations, and these are influenced both by molecular properties and the solid-state packing arrangement, making computational modelling challenging. Here, we investigate a series of known organic electronic materials that have published crystal structures using periodic density functional theory (DFT) and compare their calculated electronic properties of optical absorption and reduction and oxidation potentials with literature experimental data. Furthermore we perform a series of gas-phase molecular calculations which show a good agreement with literature data and periodic DFT for the optoelectronic properties of the organic molecular crystals studied, showing that gas-phase molecular calculations could be used to screen organic crystals for OWS at a reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>RHEED pattern classification by a convolutional neural network for the growth of chalcogenide thin films and nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) plays a critical role for in-situ characterization in molecular beam epitaxy, pulsed laser deposition and sputtering. While sensitive to crystal symmetries and morphology, it is used ubiquitously to determine the growth modes of thin films. However, analysis of RHEED patterns depends on skilled experts and is therefore difficult to incorporate into the growth strategy in real-time. The development of machine learning (ML) processes, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), presents a unique opportunity towards real-time RHEED pattern recognition. In this study, we develop a CNN model that can accurately classify four common and distinct RHEED patterns present in chalcogenide thin film growth. Its reached accuracy reached 94.9% for single run and 91.2% when averaged over 20 seeds. Our network is able to distinguish the nucleation of three common growth modes encountered in epitaxy, namely Volmer Weber, Stransky-Krastanov and Frank-van der Merwe, potentially enabling future automation of substrate temperature and shutter control informed by RHEED data. The network is material-agnostic and distinguishes the VW process with greater than 98% accuracy but is somewhat more limited in its ability to properly classify roughening and the initiation of Stransky-Krastanov growth. Our findings show that ML techniques can be successfully implemented even in cases where there is no detailed knowledge of growth chemistry providing an avenue towards real-time incorporation of ML to control nanostructure nucleation and thin film morphology.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole formation and coupling to magnetic and structural degrees of freedom in the $5d^1$ double perovskites Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between charge, magnetic, and structural degrees of freedom in the isostructural and isoelectronic $5d^1$ double-perovskites Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$. Using first-principles-based electronic structure calculations, we show that both materials exhibit a tendency toward spontaneous quadrupolar order in the cubic paramagnetic phase, which is slightly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ than in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$. Our analysis further reveals an intimate coupling between the local magnetic moments and charge quadrupoles, mediated by the strong spin-orbit interaction, that leads to the unusual canted configuration of magnetic moments observed in these systems. When structural degrees of freedom are included, the two materials exhibit pronounced differences. In Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ the strong coupling to Jahn-Teller distortions stabilizes the antiferroic $\mathcal{Q}_{x^2-y^2}$ order, yielding excellent agreement with available experimental data. In contrast, the Jahn-Teller coupling is significantly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ and appears insufficient to stabilize the antiferroic quadrupolar order. While this is consistent with the absence of any measurable long-range structural distortion above the magnetic transition temperature, it contrasts with experimental results indicating a strong canting of the magnetic moments. Our analysis thus successfully describes the mechanisms shaping the properties of the Re-compound while a full quantitative description of the magnetic ground state of Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ is still elusive.</description>

      <title>Phonon assisted light absorption and emission in cubic-Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is a wide-bandgap polymorph of boron nitride whose optical response remains only partially understood due to the coexistence of indirect electronic transitions and strong exciton-phonon coupling. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory, we investigate the optical properties of cBN by combining GW quasiparticle corrections with Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations of excitonic effects. Phonon-assisted absorption and emission processes are explicitly included through the exciton-phonon coupling formalism. We find that phonon-mediated optical transitions provide a dominant contribution to both absorption and luminescence spectra, partially reconciling the discrepancy between the theoretical optical gap ($\simeq$ 11 eV) and experimental emission around 6-7 eV. Our results demonstrate the importance of including exciton-phonon interactions for the correct interpretation of experimental spectra, offering new insights into light emission in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Large Pyroelectric Enhancement in Freestanding Epitaxial BaTiO3 Membranes on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric membranes transferred onto arbitrary substrates provide reduced mechanical clamping at the interfaces that can diminish the effective polarization-rotation barrier offering a pathway to engineer larger electromechanical and thermally driven responses in oxide electronics. Here, we report integration of single crystalline thin film BaTiO3 (BTO) ferroelectric membrane on Si and demonstrate a 4x at 30C and 34x at 60C enhancement of pyroelectric coefficient compared to clamped films. The BTO membrane is grown epitaxially on a water-soluble Sr3Al2O6 sacrificial layer, released by selective dissolution, and transferred onto Si, yielding a strain-relaxed membrane with robust intrinsic polarization. Temperature dependent piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) reveals pronounced thermally driven evolution of domain orientation, consistent with reduced barriers for dipolar modulation in the freestanding state. Variable-temperature Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) quantifies an effective pyroelectric coefficient of ~75 uC/m^2K at 30C and 450 uC/m^2K at 60C with a detectivity of 40 m^2K^-1at room temperature. These results establish lead-free freestanding BTO membranes as a promising silicon-integrable platform for cryogen-free infrared detection and waste-heat energy management.</description>

      <title>Martensitic laminate geometry controls electronic phase transitions in a Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-lowering structural phase transitions result in multiple degenerate structures whose coexistence is determined by macroscopic strain compatibility. In quantum materials, these structural transformations often couple to electronic degrees of freedom, yet how the structural arrangements influence electronic phase transitions remains poorly understood. By analyzing hundreds of diffraction peaks from X-ray reciprocal space mapping, we determine the lattice basis vectors and mutual orientations of all coexisting phases in epitaxial V2O3 thin films after a symmetry-lowering transformation coincident with a metal-insulator transition. We identify the orientations of interfaces between all coexisting structures using the theory of martensitic phase transformations and find that the low temperature structure comprises finely tuned layered mixtures of alternating twin variants, akin to metal alloys. By comparing films grown on various substrate orientations, we show that the metal-insulator transition temperature increases monotonically with the degree to which these layered mixtures satisfy macroscopic strain compatibility imposed by the substrate.</description>

      <title>Finely Tunable Thermal Expansion of NiTi by Stress-Induced Martensitic Transformation and Thermomechanical Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring the thermal expansion of martensitic materials by crystallographic texture and anisotropic variation of lattice parameters is a promising route to a flexible design of thermally stable systems. NiTi alloys are prototype materials in this respect, with shape-memory and superelastic properties owing to their thermoelastic martensitic transformations. Here, we propose a method to realize finely tunable coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) for the NiTi alloy based upon a special combination of mechanical and thermal training. We achieve a near-zero in-plane CTE that is smaller in value than that of the FeNi-based Invar alloy. Atomistic simulations and theoretical calculations guide the method design and clarify the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between the processing conditions, the microstructural evolution, and the thermal expansion behavior. The directions for further, finer adjustments of the CTE without constraints on the shape of the materials are indicated.</description>

      <title>A stochastic simulation of the dislocation-mediated etching of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) can be fabricated by electrochemically etching nitride epitaxial structures consisting of alternating layers of highly n-type doped and non-intentionally doped (NID) GaN. Threading dislocations (TDs) can be electrochemically etched into transport pipelines that can carry the etchant through the NID layers to access the doped material. Experimentally this has been shown to involve a mechanism where the etching pathway may follow one TD into a doped layer and then propagate sideways through the doped layer to continue via a different TD. Across multiple layers this process creates complex pore structures that have been described as 'cascades'. Here, we build a stochastic simulation for the DBR etching process that can reproduce some key features of the observed microstructures including the cascade morphology. By comparing the simulation output to samples etched at a range of voltages, we show that we can reproduce variations in experimental chronoamperometry data with applied bias by varying the probability of etching the doped layers within the simulation. The outputs of the resulting simulations replicate the experimentally observed cascade morphology. At higher voltages, experimental data reveal a lower proportion of cascade features, a trend that is also replicated by the simulations for relevant probability values. Outputs of the simulations also correlate well with experimental chronoamperometry data for samples where - unlike in a DBR - the thicknesses of the doped layers vary through the epitaxial multilayer, suggesting that the probabilistic simulation can be applied to a range of structures to help understand the dislocation-mediated electrochemical etching process.</description>

      <title>Phase-field simulations of nucleation, growth, and coarsening of $\beta_1$ precipitates in Mg-Nd alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution and morphology of precipitates formed during aging are key factors that determine the precipitation hardening response of various magnesium-rare earth alloys. In recent years, the use of high-performance computing clusters and massively parallel frameworks has enabled quantitative simulations of the evolution of individual and multiple precipitates at relevant length and time scales. However, predictive modeling of precipitate evolution remains challenging, in part because many key thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the underlying physics are either unknown or have a high degree of uncertainty. In this work, we developed a workflow in which experimental data were used to parameterize a phase-field model to perform two-dimensional (2D) simulations of concurrent nucleation and evolution of $\beta_1$ precipitates in magnesium-neodymium alloy during aging. Matrix composition and precipitate number density at different aging times were obtained from atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy measurements, respectively. We applied a stereological method to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) number densities from experimental cross-sectional transmission electron micrographs. The estimated 3D number density data were then converted to effective 2D number densities. The effective 2D number density and composition data were used to determine the required model parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between simulation and experimental results. The parameterized model allows for quantitative phase-field simulations of nucleation and growth of $\beta_1$ precipitates, which can be employed to optimize aging time to achieve a target number density of precipitates. This work highlights an approach to overcome the challenges associated with parameterizing a coupled phase-field and nucleation model.</description>

      <title>Identification of Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Species by Joint Characterization of Li-ion Battery Chemistry by Mass Spectrometry and Electro-Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) play a central role in determining the long-term performance and safety of modern electrochemical energy storage systems. Despite decades of research, the SEI's heterogeneous, dynamic, and multi-phase nature has defied comprehensive molecular-level characterization, creating a critical knowledge gap that limits rational battery design. In this work, we introduce a computational-experimental framework that integrates high-throughput quantum chemistry calculations, data-driven electro-chemical reaction networks (eCRNs), stochastic algorithms, and Laser Desorption/Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (LDI-FTICR-MS) to unravel SEI formation in carbonate-based electrolytes without imposing predefined mechanisms. We constructed the most comprehensive eCRN to date, spanning over 10,000 species and 209 million reactions. Through stochastic network analysis, we successfully recovered 27 species that were previously reported in literature and predicted 28 novel SEI species, nearly doubling our scientific knowledge in this area. Each new species was rigorously confirmed through advanced mass spectra analysis of its distinct molecular and isotopic signatures. We kinetically refined the formation pathways for a select set of both previously reported and novel SEI products, revealing kinetically feasible elementary reaction mechanisms with activation barriers below 1 eV. This computational-experimental approach deepens our molecular-level understanding of SEI chemistry and supports the rational design of advanced electrolytes and engineered interphases for next-generation lithium-based batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can accelerate materials discovery. Models perform impressively on many benchmarks. However, strong benchmark performance does not imply that a model learned chemistry. I test a concrete alternative hypothesis: that property prediction can be driven by bibliographic confounding. Across five tasks spanning MOFs (thermal and solvent stability), perovskite solar cells (efficiency), batteries (capacity), and TADF emitters (emission wavelength), models trained on standard chemical descriptors predict author, journal, and publication year well above chance. When these predicted metadata ("bibliographic fingerprints") are used as the sole input to a second model, performance is sometimes competitive with conventional descriptor-based predictors. These results show that many datasets do not rule out non-chemical explanations of success. Progress requires routine falsification tests (e.g., group/time splits and metadata ablations), datasets designed to resist spurious correlations, and explicit separation of two goals: predictive utility versus evidence of chemical understanding.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to track the evolution of charge density wave (CDW) correlations in Sn-doped Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum, we evidence robust signatures of CDW correlations at temperature and doping ranges far beyond the phase boundary of long-range CDW order. Remarkably, we unveil short-range CDW correlations survive up to room temperature in $x = 0.32$ Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, supported by synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. We point out the introduction of quenched disorder by Sn doping can pin the CDW and form static short-range CDW, which can explain the observed persistent CDW signatures. Our results thus corroborate the ubiquity and robustness of CDW correlations in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and provide new insights on the role of disorders on the CDW correlations in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.</description>

      <title>Dynamic topological exciton-polaritons enabling ultrafast logic operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological active materials have emerged as powerful paradigm bridging the discovery of exotic topological phases of matter with the development of functional topological devices. The recent extension of these material systems into dynamic regime, where topological properties can be actively manipulated at ultrafast timescales, promises unprecedented control over topological states and their functionalities. However, translating the static topological lasing signals into high-performance logic functions remain highly challenging, which imposes a far more stringent set of materials attributes. Here, leveraging the strong nonlinearity and pronounced spectral isolation of perovskite exciton-polaritons embedded in a Dirac vortex microcavity, we experimentally demonstrate the dynamic topological Majorana-like state polariton condensation with its ultrafast logic operations at room temperature. By actively coordinating pump and control beams in both spectral and temporal domain, we dynamically steer the topological polariton condensation process and demonstrate AND and NOT logic operations, achieving record extinction ratio (~20 dB), extremely low control fluence (~0.2 nJ/cm2) and sub-picosecond response time (~500 fs). Our results expand the frontier of dynamic topology and establish a novel pathway towards robust, ultrafast, and reconfigurable on-chip polaritonic logic circuits.</description>

      <title>Extended Mean-Field Theory for the 2D Hubbard Model in Degenerate Dilute Electron Gases: Fluctuations, Superconducting Dome, and Interaction Mechanisms in Strontium Titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3, STO}$) dome-shaped superconducting transition temperature as a function of chemical potential, consistent with STO experiments, and shows that tunable s-wave and d-wave symmetries are modulated by doping. Superconducting fluctuations validate the mean-field approximation at low temperatures but destroy pairing at higher temperatures. The charge-density-wave order competes with superconductivity, enhances the effective electron mass inversely with the chemical potential, and increases with the interaction strength $U$ and the temperature $T$. SDW order is rare and fragile, while an additional magnetic term induces subtle band splitting. These findings suggest e-e contributions to STO's transport anomalies and provide criteria to distinguish e-e from e-ph origins, offering insights for engineering higher $T_c$ in dilute systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>Bright-dark exciton splitting in lead halide perovskite crystals accessed via quantum beats in photon echoes</title>

Abstract: Understanding the fine structure of excitons is crucial for optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications of lead halide perovskites. It is demonstrated that polarization-sensitive photon echo spectroscopy in magnetic field provides a powerful method to access coherent exciton dynamics and reveal their energy level structure, which is hidden by inhomogeneous broadening. Exciton quantum beats observed in both Faraday and Voigt geometries offer a precise probe of the energy splittings among the four 1$s$ exciton states, enabling determination of the fine structure and bright-dark splittings. Application of this technique to bulk mixed halide perovskite crystals FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ reveals a bright-dark exciton splitting of $\Delta_\mathrm{X}=0.46~$meV, along with electron and hole Land\'{e} $g$ factors $g_\mathrm{e}=3.38$ and $g_\mathrm{h}=-1.14$, respectively. The quantum beats persist on timescales of 20--50$~$ps, demonstrating remarkably robust spin and optical coherences at cryogenic temperature of 2$~$K. The decay of the quantum beats of the outer doublet is governed by dephasing due to dispersion of the bright-dark splitting of $\sim0.06~$meV caused by localization potential fluctuations, while dephasing in the bright exciton inner doublet originates from a small zero field splitting of $\sim0.035~$meV due to anisotropic potentials.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of swift-electron momentum transfer to a large spherical nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swift electrons from highly focused beams produced in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes offer a powerful route for probing and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion. Our work establishes a robust reference framework for momentum transfer calculations and provides quantitative benchmarks relevant for electron-beam-based nanoscale manipulation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Force Imaging of 2D Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are central to our understanding of the connection between topological symmetries in a material and its band electronics. Within this class of materials, a breadth of complex quantum behaviors, such as persistent spin-polarized current states in the presence of a broken time reversal symmetry, and temperature-independent topological protection of quantum states, are thought to exist. However, current studies using photoemission and spectroscopic analyses or transport experiments fail to provide insight into the interplay between the physical 2D manifold and the band topology itself, since they do not provide spatial resolution of the phenomena to be understood. In this work, we develop a methodology for applying magnetic force microscopy to such systems to address this issue. Using well-characterized 2D crystallites of bismuth telluride ($Bi_2$$Te_3$), we image the magnetic signal directly associated with topological edge states. The observed phase contrast is remarkably robust at a temperature of 25{\deg}C and occurs across crystallite sizes and shapes. A detailed analysis of the magnetic imaging suggests that the current observed is composed of two parts: the first is a persistent current ($I_{Persistent}$) as predicted by theory, and the second is due to Faraday induction, $I_{Faraday}$. Damping dynamics of the cantilever during imaging further suggest that this Faraday EMF is established by spin accumulation along the 1D edge channel of the crystal, which then converts to a charge current in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, creating a novel form of rectification in the channel. This unexpected result can prompt new ideas for topology-based circuit elements with extremely low losses and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Responsive Disorder in a Metal-Organic Framework Enables Solid-State Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems with nonlinear response mechanisms can be applied as reservoir computers for energy-efficient machine learning tasks. Historically explored at the macro- and meso-scale, physical reservoir computing has recently been extended to the atomic scale via chemical mixtures with strong and dynamic heterogeneity. Here we explore the possibility that configurational degeneracy within disordered materials might form the basis for solid-state atomic-scale reservoirs. Our proof-of-concept uses the disordered metal-organic framework DUT-8, which undergoes a series of disorder-disorder transitions on exposure to different guest species. We show that variations in X-ray diffuse scattering associated with these transitions function as suitable readouts for machine learning applications. A combination of nonlinearity and memory effects in the DUT-8 response allows the system to carry out both classification and time-series machine learning tasks with accuracies comparable to those of mesoscale physical reservoir computers. Our results suggest a new avenue for exploiting correlated disorder in solid phases whenever the nature of that disorder can be modulated through external perturbations-a phenomenon we term `responsive disorder'.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of topological band structures and electronic correlations may lead to novel quantum phenomena with potential applications. First-principles calculations are critical for guiding experimental discoveries and interpretations, but often fail if electronic correlations cannot be properly treated. Here we show that this issue occurs also in the kagome altermagnets Mn$_3X$ ($X=$ Sn, Ge, Ga), which were believed to exhibit large anomalous Hall effect due to topological band structures with Weyl nodes near the Fermi energy. Our systematic investigations reveal critical importance of beyond-DFT treatments on three key aspects of their magnetic, electronic, and topological properties: (1) establishment of noncollinear altermagnetic orders, (2) weakly renormalized band structures in excellent agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment, and (3) sensitive tuning of the Weyl nodes. Our work provides a unified basis for understanding topological properties of the Mn$_3X$ family, which challenges previous experimental interpretations based on DFT band structures and predicts potentially higher anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Ga under electron doping. This underscores the importance of a correlation-aware framework beyond DFT in understanding topological magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: Density function theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure theory. However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, two-dimensional materials pose a special challenge, as all these materials and their heterostructures have a crucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially inhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in almost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description. We present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this problem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise linearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.</description>

      <title>The Plastic Origin of van der Waals material GaGeTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plastic inorganic semiconductors are promising candidates for high performance stable flexible electronics. Germanium based chalcogenide materials are well known for excellent semiconducting properties, specifically superior carrier mobility. However, these materials typically exhibit inherent brittleness, which in germanium tellurides originates from the intrinsic half bond nature of the metavalent Ge Te bond. Here, we report an ultra high plasticity germanium based chalcogenide of GaGeTe. Bulk GaGeTe can sustain a large engineering strain up to 7.5% without fracture. Through a comprehensive multi scale investigation ranging from macroscopic characterization to atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, we reveal that the exceptional plasticity is due to a synergistic effect of interlayer gliding and intralayer lattice distortion. DFT calculations further elucidate the chemical origin. The existence of Ga atoms avoids the formation of brittle metavalent Ge Te bonds. Instead, a robust honeycomb lattice formed by strong Ga Te, Ge Ge, and Ga Ge bonds preserves high bond strength under large tensile strains in simulations, thereby underpinning the macroscopic plastic behavior. This systematic study on the origin of the plasticity in GaGeTe introduces bond engineering as a potential approach for constructing plastic inorganic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Robust and tunable Floquet altermagnets in sliding A-type antiferromagnetic bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arranging the stacking orders of A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) bilayers offers a practical pathway to realizing two-dimensional altermagnets. Previous proposals, however, rely on stringent symmetry constraints, including layer groups and stacking registries. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling altermagnetism without these restrictions. Our comprehensive symmetry analysis reveals that inversionsymmetric A-AFM bilayer building blocks can host altermagnetism that is robust against stacking slides and variations in illumination direction, with rich and continuously tunable symmetry representations. Using bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a case study, we show that out-of-plane CPL stabilizes distinct $f$-wave or $p$-wave altermagnetic states in forward stacking, while reverse stacking manifests an even-odd parity conversion of altermagnetism based upon specific sliding configurations. These revealments broaden the scope of altermagnet design in inversion-symmetric A-AFM bilayers and establish CPL as a versatile control knob for engineering altermagnetic symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description>

      <title>Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain engineering, reliable methods for controlling ferroelectricity are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains in the nanoparticles are absent too. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the HfO2 nanoparticles was not explored. In this work, we study the influence of chemical stress on phase diagrams, dielectric and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional that includes higher-order contributions together with trilinear and biquadratic couplings involving polar, antipolar, and nonpolar order parameters. The ferroelectric phase exhibits reentrant behavior as a function of nanoparticle size, such that the spontaneous polarization exists only within a limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min&lt;R_c&lt;R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is primarily determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects; the maximal critical radius R_cr^max is primarily determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Thus, this work identifies a stress-driven mechanism for reentrant ferroelectricity stabilization in nanoscale hafnia-zirconia, arising from the competition between depolarization field-induced suppression of ferroelectricity and its support by shell-induced chemical stress.</description>

Abstract: Lithium (Li) plating on graphite is a significant degradation mechanism in Li-ion batteries. While numerous experimental techniques have been used to study Li plating in laboratory cells, investigations of commercial high-energy cells often rely on electrochemical methods. Here we present and classify various methods for detecting Li plating on a commercial A123 pouch cell. In a round robin study across multiple battery research laboratories, Li-plated graphitic electrode material was analyzed using electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic methods capable of detecting metallic Li deposits. After cell opening, their overall distribution on the anode surface was examined using a flatbed scanner to ensure comparability of the samples. Optical and electron microscopy provided detailed surface and, in combination with a focused ion beam, subsurface structure and morphology. Spectroscopic methods confirmed the presence and onset of plated Li with varying sensitivity. Moreover, spectroscopic and imaging techniques were combined correlatively where possible. Availability and measurement duration of each technique was compared. Optical methods are fast and easy to use; thus, they are recommended for most samples, with spectroscopic confirmation reserved for reference samples. This multimodal study demonstrates a range of methods that can be used alone or in combination to qualitatively or quantitatively detect Li-plating.</description>

      <title>Co-Evolution-Based Metal-Binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein-metal interactions is central to structural biology, with metal ions being vital for catalysis, stability, and signal transduction. Predicting metal-binding residues and metal types remains challenging due to the structural and evolutionary complexity of proteins. Conventional sequence- and structure-based methods often fail to capture co-evolutionary constraints that reflect how residues evolve together to maintain metal-binding functionality. Recent co-evolution-based methods capture part of this information, but still underutilize the complete co-evolved residue network. To address this limitation, we introduce the Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network (MBGNN), which leverages the complete co-evolved residue network to better capture complex dependencies within protein structures. Experimental results show that MBGNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art co-evolution-based method MetalNet2, achieving F1 score improvements of 2.5% for binding residue identification and 3.3% for metal type classification on the MetalNet2 dataset. Its superiority is further demonstrated on both the MetalNet2 and MIonSite datasets, where it outperforms two co-evolution-based and two sequence-based methods, achieving the highest mean F1 scores across both prediction tasks. These findings highlight how integrating co-evolutionary residue networks with graph-based learning advances our ability to decode protein-metal interactions, thereby facilitating functional annotation and rational metalloprotein design. The code and data are released at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent quasiparticle lifetimes in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body effects on the spin-split electron bands in altermagnets by computing the electron self-energy arising from interactions with magnons, phonons, and hybridized magnon-phonon modes. These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems. By including the temperature dependence of the self-energies, we also quantify how thermal fluctuations influence the broadening of the electronic states.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Thermodynamic, Elastic, and Optical properties of LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) low Tc Superconductors through First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) compounds crystallize in a tetragonal layered ThCr2Si2-type structure and belong to a family of low critical temperature superconductors. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations implemented in the CASTEP code, we systematically investigated their structural, mechanical, elastic, electronic, vibrational, thermophysical, and optical properties for the first time. The optimized structural parameters show good agreement with available experimental data. The Born stability criteria and negative formation energies confirm the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of these materials. Poisson and Pugh ratios indicate a ductile nature, while low Debye and melting temperatures together with low Vickers hardness suggest that the compounds are relatively soft. The electronic band structures and density of states reveal metallic behavior. Charge density distribution and Mulliken population analysis indicate mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding. The calculated Fermi surfaces contain both hole-like and electron-like sheets, suggesting possible multiband characteristics. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms the dynamical stability of LaRh2Al2 and LaRh2Ga2, while LaRh2In2 shows dynamical instability associated with a possible structural phase transition. Optical property analysis indicates that these superconductors may be promising candidates for high-density optical data storage applications. The estimated electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.56 indicates that LaRh2X2 compounds are weakly coupled low critical temperature superconductors.</description>
