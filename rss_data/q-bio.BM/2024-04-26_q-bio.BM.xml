      <title>ApisTox: a new benchmark dataset for the classification of small molecules toxicity on honey bees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global decline in bee populations poses significant risks to agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental stability. To bridge the gap in existing data, we introduce ApisTox, a comprehensive dataset focusing on the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). This dataset combines and leverages data from existing sources such as ECOTOX and PPDB, providing an extensive, consistent, and curated collection that surpasses the previous datasets. ApisTox incorporates a wide array of data, including toxicity levels for chemicals, details such as time of their publication in literature, and identifiers linking them to external chemical databases. This dataset may serve as an important tool for environmental and agricultural research, but also can support the development of policies and practices aimed at minimizing harm to bee populations. Finally, ApisTox offers a unique resource for benchmarking molecular property prediction methods on agrochemical compounds, facilitating advancements in both environmental science and cheminformatics. This makes it a valuable tool for both academic research and practical applications in bee conservation.</description>

      <title>Exact analytical algorithm for solvent accessible surface area and derivatives in implicit solvent molecular simulations on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present dSASA (differentiable SASA), an exact geometric method to calculate solvent accessible surface area (SASA) analytically along with atomic derivatives on GPUs. The atoms in a molecule are first assigned to tetrahedra in groups of four atoms by Delaunay tetrahedrization adapted for efficient GPU implementation and the SASA values for atoms and molecules are calculated based on the tetrahedrization information and inclusion-exclusion method. The SASA values from the numerical icosahedral-based method can be reproduced with more than 98% accuracy for both proteins and RNAs. Having been implemented on GPUs and incorporated into the software Amber, we can apply dSASA to implicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations with inclusion of this nonpolar term. The current GPU version of GB/SA simulations has been accelerated up to nearly 20-fold compared to the CPU version, outperforming LCPO, a commonly used, fast algorithm for calculating SASA, as the system size increases. While we focus on the accuracy of the SASA calculations for proteins and nucleic acids, we also demonstrate stable GB/SA MD mini-protein simulations.</description>
