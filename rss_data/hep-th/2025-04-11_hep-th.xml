      <title>Localizing Romans supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general formula for the on-shell action of six-dimensional Euclidean Romans supergravity using equivariant localization. Our results are obtained without the need for solving any of the equations of motion, instead working on the assumption of the existence of a solution. We show that the on-shell action is completely determined in terms of the R-symmetry Killing vector and topological data. We easily recover known results in the literature, make predictions for hitherto unknown solutions, and also match to holographic field theory duals.</description>

      <title>ER for typical EPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What do the typical entangled states of two black holes look like? Do they contain firewalls? We approach these questions constructively, providing ensembles of states which densely explore the black hole Hilbert space. None of the states contain firewalls. On the contrary, they contain very long Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities. Distinguishing these ensembles from the typical entangled states of the black holes is hard. We quantify this by deriving the correspondence between a microscopic notion of quantum randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole. This formalizes a "complexity = geometry'' relation.</description>

      <title>Spacetime $Lw_{1+\infty}$ Symmetry and Self-Dual Gravity in Plebanski Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of self-dual Einstein spacetimes in 4 dimensions is acted on by an infinite dimensional Lie algebra called the $Lw_{1+\infty}$ algebra. In this work we explain how one can ``build up'' self-dual metrics by acting on the flat metric with an arbitrary number of infinitesimal $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformations, using a convenient choice of gauge called Plebanski gauge. We accomplish this through the use of something called a ``perturbiner expansion,'' which will perturbatively generate for us a self-dual metric starting from an initial set of quasinormal modes called integer modes. Each integer mode corresponds to a particular $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformation, and this perturbiner expansion of integer modes will be written as a sum over ``marked tree graphs,'' instead of momentum space Feynman diagrams.
  We find that a subset of the $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformations act as spacetime diffeomorphisms, and the algebra of these diffeomorphisms is $w_{\infty} \ltimes f$. We also show all analogous results hold for the $Ls$ algebra in self-dual Yang Mills.</description>

      <title>Expanding on the double copy in null Fermi coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Weyl classical double copy for a Fermi normal coordinate expansion around null geodesics. To leading order in this "Penrose expansion", we recover a previously proposed double copy of the Penrose limit. For spacetimes with an exact double copy, this Penrose limit double copy is extended to all orders. For spacetimes without such a double copy, generic obstructions appear at second subleading order. We thus argue that for any spacetime, near any null geodesic there is a classical double copy structure at least up to first subleading order in the Penrose expansion. Finally, we point out a difficulty in identifying an appropriate flat space to extend our results to the Kerr-Schild double copy, related to the generic incompatibility between Kerr-Schild and Penrose-G\"uven gauge.</description>

      <title>Through the Looking-Glass, and What AdS Found There: quantum particle production with a Whittaker spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-inverted anti-de Sitter space -- ``flipped AdS'' -- is studied through the accelerating boundary correspondence of a moving mirror trajectory. The particle production exhibits positive energy flux and a finite total energy (both unlike AdS). The particle spectrum is of Whittaker form, with some similarities to a Planck thermal spectrum. We also derive the corresponding spacetime metric, with similarities to regular de Sitter space, but exhibiting a tower of repeated causal regions with horizons.</description>

      <title>An exceptional story: Symmetries and dualities between Maximal supergravity and General relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the historical path from General relativity to the construction of Maximal $\mathcal{N}_4 = 8$ Supergravity with a detour in D=10 and 11 dimensions. The supergravities obtained by toric dimensional reduction and/or by reducing the number of supersymmetry generators have large exceptional duality symmetry groups and exhibit a remarkably uniform pattern across all values of $\mathcal{N}_D$ and D. In particular (bosonic) General relativity fits in as the simplest case and anchors us to the Real world. Dimensional reduction to 2 dimensions brings us to affine Kac-Moody groups and their semi-direct products with a real form of the Witt algebra: there is "integrable Magics". Integrability of 4D Gravity and of its reduction to 2D is considered with their "Twisted self-duality". Hyperbolic Kac-Moody symmetries appear after reduction to 1D: this leads to "chaotic Magics". We then discover "Borcherds"-Kac-Moody symmetries that allow us to rewrite in any dimension all matter equations of motion as Twisted self-duality: "Algebraic geometric Magics". Finally a "BF" metasymmetry $\Sigma$ exchanges negative quartets of Fermionic dimensions with Bosonic ones inside two Magic triangles. A third ubiquitous triangle of symmetries from Invariant theory resists unification despite its strong resemblance to the others. The prospective remarks include seven Challenges.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group-like flows in randomly connected tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomly connected tensor networks (RCTN) are the dynamical systems defined by summing over all the possible networks of tensors. Because of the absence of fixed lattice structure, RCTN is not expected to have renormalization procedures. In this paper, however, we consider RCTN with a real tensor, and it is proven that a Hamiltonian vector flow of a tensor model in the canonical formalism with a positive cosmological constant has the properties which a renormalization group (RG) flow of RCTN would have: The flow has fixed points on phase transition surfaces; every flow line is asymptotically terminated by fixed points at both ends, where an upstream fixed point has higher criticality than a downstream one; the flow goes along phase transition surfaces; there exists a function which monotonically decreases along the flow, analogously to the $a$- and $c$-functions of RG. A complete classification of fixed points is given. Although there are no cyclic flows in the strict sense, these exist, if infinitesimal jumps are allowed near fixed points.</description>

      <title>An intrinsic cosmological observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in the necessity of an observer degree of freedom in the description of local algebras in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we describe an example where the observer can be constructed intrinsically from the quantum fields. This construction involves the slow-roll inflation example recently analyzed by Chen and Penington, in which the gauge-invariant gravitational algebra arises from marginalizing over modular flow in a de Sitter static patch. We relate this procedure to the Connes-Takesaki theory of the flow of weights for type III von Neumann algebras, and further show that the resulting gravitational algebra can naturally be presented as a crossed product. This leads to a decomposition of the gravitational algebra into quantum field and observer degrees of freedom, with different choices of observer being related to changes in a quantum reference frame for the algebra. We also connect this example to other constructions of type II algebras in semiclassical gravity, and argue they all share the feature of being the result of gauging modular flow. The arguments in this work involve various properties of automorphism groups of hyperfinite factors, and so in an appendix we review the structure of these groups, which may be of independent interest for further investigations into von Neumann algebras in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Amplitudes and Holographic Correlators in AdS3/CFT2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Carrollian amplitudes of massless scalars in (1+2) Minkowski space. Using the prescription recently shown by Alday et al. [JHEP 03 (2025) 158] originally designed for the AdS4 Witten diagrams, we show that AdS3 Witten diagrams in position space in the flat space limit reduce to Carrollian amplitudes. The flat space limit in the bulk is implemented by the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Focusing on four-point correlators with contact and exchange diagrams, we show that the Carrollian limit makes the universality of the bulk point singularity manifest upon performing analytic continuation to the Lorentzian signature of the boundary correlators. Unlike four-point Carrollian amplitudes in (1+3) dimensions, the (1+2) dimensional ones are non-distributional, having analytic properties simpler than the AdS correlators. We also observe for the first time a double copy structure of Carrollian amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Four-loop renormalization with a cutoff in a sextic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum action for a three-dimensional real sextic model using the background field method is considered. Four-loop renormalization of this model is performed with a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation. The coefficients for the renormalization constants are found, the applicability of the $\mathcal{R}$-operation within the proposed regularization is explicitly demonstrated, and the absence of nonlocal contributions is proved. Additionally, the explicit form of the singularities, power and logarithmic, as well as their dependence on the deformation of the Green's function are discussed.</description>

      <title>Resummation of Universal Tails in Gravitational Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formula for the universal anomalous scaling of the multipole moments of a generic gravitating source in classical general relativity. We derive this formula in two independent ways using effective field theory methods. First, we use the absorption of low frequency gravitational waves by a black hole to identify the total multipole scaling dimension as the renormalized angular momentum of black hole perturbation theory. More generally, we show that the anomalous dimension is determined by phase shifts of gravitational waves elastically scattering off generic source multipole moments, which reproduces the renormalized angular momentum in the particular case of black holes. The effective field theory approach thus clarifies the role of the renormalized angular momentum in the multipole expansion. The universality of the point-particle effective description of compact gravitating systems further allows us to extract the universal part of the anomalous dimension, which is the same for any object, including black holes, neutron stars, and binary systems. As an application, we propose a novel resummation of the universal short-distance logarithms (``tails'') in the gravitational waveform of binary systems, which may improve the modeling of signals from current and future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Gauge and parametrization dependence of Quantum Einstein Gravity within the Proper Time flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper time functional flow equations have garnered significant attention in recent years, as they are particularly suitable in analyzing non-perturbative contexts. By resorting to this flow, we investigate the regulator and gauge dependence in quantum Einstein gravity within the asymptotic safety framework, considering various regularization schemes. Our findings indicate that some details of the regulator have minor influence on the critical properties of the theory. In contrast, the selection between linear and exponential parametrizations appears to have a more substantial impact on the scaling behavior of the renormalized flow near the non-Gaussian fixed point.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structure Constants in Planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM: From Small Spin to Strong Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure constants of two conformal primary operators and one spinning operator in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory using the hexagon formalism. By analytically continuing in the spin, we derive a formula for computing these structure constants at any coupling in the small-spin limit, up to a normalization factor. This formula allows us to explore their analytical properties at strong coupling. In this regime, using classical string calculations and a suitable ansatz, we extend our analysis to finite-spin operators, verifying recent two-loop results for structure constants in string theory and generalizing them to operators with arbitrary R-charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of a non-singular black hole model with effective quantum corrections motivated by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The effective geometry has a transition surface that connects trapped and anti-trapped regions with the same mass. There is a minimum mass for which the horizon temperature and Komar energy are zero, and the black hole stops its Hawking evaporation. For horizons above this limit, we present the grey-body factors, emission spectra, and the mass loss rate, solving a one-dimensional Schrdinger-type equation with an effective short-range potential barrier for massless fields of spins 0, 1/2, 1 and 2.</description>

Abstract: The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is a simple, yet elegant and powerful method for solving second-order differential equations of generalized hypergeometric type. In the past, it has been used to solve many problems in quantum mechanics and elsewhere. We apply this method to the classical problem of hydrogen-like atoms in spaces of constant curvature. Both the spectra of these atoms and their wave functions, including normalization, are easily obtained.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Stability Switches from Attractive to Repulsive at 2d Pomeranchuk/Stoner Instabilities via Field-Theoretical RG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an interacting two-flavor fermionic system via field-theoretical functional renormalization group (RG). Each flavor, labeled by $\pm$, has a dispersion of $E^{\pm}=c k^{2\alpha}-\mu^\pm$ with tunable real exponent $\alpha&gt;0$. The effective theory is parametrized by intra-flavor and inter-flavor interactions, preserving global U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetry, which can be enhanced to U(2). The U(2) symmetric system has a Fermi liquid phase and two possible instabilities, leading to spontaneous spatial rotational or flavor symmetry breaking, known as the Pomeranchuk and Stoner instabilities, respectively. The key discovery of this work is the following. The Stoner instability possesses an RG fixed point that preserves the U(2) symmetry. For $\alpha&lt;1$, this fixed point is attractive, indicating a continuous transition. Conversely, for $\alpha&gt;1$, the fixed point becomes repulsive, and without fine-tuning, there is runaway RG flow, resulting in a discontinuous transition. The U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetric system, with $\mu^+\neq \mu^-$, exhibits richer physics. This system have two Pomeranchuk instabilities. At one of them, a non-trivial RG fixed point switches its nature from attractive to repulsive as $\alpha$ increases across $1$. Notably, the runaway flow at $\alpha&gt;1$ results in the depletion of a Fermi surface at the transition. Collective modes in these Fermi liquids are also investigated. A universal Fermi surface deformation ratio $\delta\mu^+/\delta\mu^-$ is predicted for $\alpha&lt;1$ at the instability as a continuous transition, which can be observed experimentally.</description>

Abstract: A key consequence of Lorentz-violating gravity is the emergence of modified dispersion relations implying the absence of a universal maximum propagation speed. This challenges the conventional notion of the event horizon as a causal boundary common to all degrees of freedom. However, certain solutions in these theories exhibit \emph{universal horizons} -- surfaces capable of trapping signals of arbitrarily high speed, thereby restoring the notion of black hole. Previous studies have extensively characterised universal horizons in settings where Lorentz violation is encoded via a hypersurface-orthogonal \ae{}ther. In this work, we explore the possibility of extending this concept to more general cases where hypersurface orthogonality is relaxed. To do so, we construct a candidate trapping surface and analyse its causal properties using a general model for Lorentz-violating matter. We find that, in addition to the standard conditions associated to universal horizons, a local vanishing of the \ae{}ther's twist is also necessary. We then provide an explicit example of such a universal horizon by suitably deforming the \ae{}ther flow in a stealth Kerr solution recently found in Einstein--\ae{}ther theory. Moreover, we analyse the behaviour of trajectories which are not analytical at the universal horizon and discuss the implications of our findings for Hawking radiation. While our analysis is motivated by Einstein-\ae{t}her gravity, our results apply to broader classes of Lorentz-violating theories, further supporting the relevance of black hole phenomenology in these frameworks.</description>

      <title>Canonical forms of polytopes from adjoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projectivizations of pointed polyhedral cones $C$ are positive geometries in the sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. Their canonical forms look like $$ \Omega_C(x)=\frac{A(x)}{B(x)} dx, $$ with $A,B$ polynomials. The denominator $B(x)$ is just the product of the linear equations defining the facets of $C$. We will see that the numerator $A(x)$ is given by the adjoint polynomial of the dual cone $C^{\vee}$. The adjoint was originally defined by Warren, who used it to construct barycentric coordinates in general polytopes. Confirming the intuition that the job of the numerator is to cancel unwanted poles outside the polytope, we will see that the adjoint is the unique polynomial of minimal degree whose hypersurface contains the residual arrangement of non-face intersections of supporting hyperplanes of $C$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Evidence for Non-Minimal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.60$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

Abstract: We explore four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories obtained from well-defined dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. When an infinite tower of corrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in which the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the early-universe, and they also admit a specific class of regular black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.</description>

      <title>Signatures of NED on Quasi periodic Oscillations of a Magnetically Charged Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole by analyzing the motion of test particles and their epicyclic frequencies. Starting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular orbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find that as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards the Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies. We further investigate the variation in the radii of QPOs with respect to the NED parameter b by employing the RP, WD, and ER models. We also perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using observational QPO data from a diverse set of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive regimes. The MCMC results yield consistent constraints on the parameter b across all mass regimes, indicating that NED effects leave a distinguishable signature on the QPO structure of a charged black hole.</description>

      <title>Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-zero potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work conducts an in-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. By integrating principles from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity (GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem technique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either canonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon structures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity (via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted by this theoretical model. The analysis uncovers a diverse range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case. These solutions encompass traversable wormholes, black universe models, where the interior of a black hole evolves into an expanding cosmological phase rather than a singularity, as well as black bounce structures and multi-horizon black holes. The results demonstrate that introducing a non-zero scalar potential within HMPG significantly expands the array of possible gravitational solutions, yielding complex causal and curvature properties that go beyond standard GR. Consequently, HMPG stands out as a powerful theoretical framework for modelling extreme astrophysical environments, where deviations from classical gravity are expected to play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognized earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit of axisymmetric spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static, axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic rate and a constant offset, which we express in terms of coordinate-invariant curvature evaluated at the unstable photon circular orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>One-loop renormalization of the effective field theory of inflationary fluctuations from gravitational interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We dig into the semi-classical description of gravity by studying one-loop corrections to primordial power spectra generated during cosmic inflation from gravitational nonlinear interactions. In the realm of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of inflationary fluctuations, we renormalize the quadratic Lagrangian dictating the linear dynamics of gauge-invariant perturbations. Since gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, this procedure is performed perturbatively in terms of negative powers of the EFT strong coupling scales. Since the interactions we consider are purely gravitational, they are ubiquitous and independent of the details of the EFT. Our results are thus relevant for a large class of approximately scale-invariant inflationary scenarios, be them driven by a single scalar field with canonical kinetic terms, or with a non-canonical structure \textit{\`a la} $P(X,\phi)$, or for an effective single-field description at the level of fluctuations only and emerging from a covariant multifield theory. Using dimensional regularization, we show that time-dependent Ultra-Violet (UV) divergences appearing at the loop level can be canceled at all times by an appropriate splitting of the bare Lagrangian into renormalized operators and counterterms. Moreover, we explicitly compute all finite contributions to the loops and we prove that, taking into account backreaction, the final one-loop renormalized power spectra of both the primordial curvature perturbation and of gravitational waves are exactly conserved on super-horizon scales. Conclusions of our work imply that the scalar and tensor propagation speeds are immune to radiative corrections from gravitational nonlinearities. We discuss a first application to multifield inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a free open fermionic string theory in a non-commutative target phase-space as well as for the space part and the momentum part. The modified commutation relations in terms of oscillating modes are derived. Modified super-Virasoro algebras are obtained in the Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz sectors where new anomaly terms appears. The non-commutativity affect the Lorentz covariance and the mass operator is no more diagonal in the usual Fock space. A redefinition of the Fock space is proposed to diagonalize the non-commutativity parameters matrices to obtain a diagonalized mass operator. Some restrictions on the non commutativity parameters are imposed to eliminate the Virasoro algerbra anomaly terms due to the non-commutativity, where at the same time the usual mass spectrum is obtained. The GSO projection is now possible where a space-time supersymmetry is obtained. More restrictions on the non-commutativity parameters zero modes are imposed and the Lorentz covariance is restored.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dynamics in Non-Minimally Coupled Theories via the Noether Symmetry and the Eisenhart-Duval Lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of a non-minimally coupled (NMC) scalar field in modified gravity, employing the Noether gauge symmetry (NGS) approach to systematically derive exact cosmological solutions. By formulating a point-like Lagrangian and analyzing the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations, conserved quantities were identified, reducing the complexity of the dynamical system. Through the application of Noether symmetry principles, the scalar field potential was found to follow a power-law form, explicitly dependent on the coupling parameter $\xi$, influencing the evolution of the universe. The study further explores inflationary dynamics, showing that for specific values of $\xi$, the potential resembles the Higgs-like structure, contributing to a deeper understanding of early cosmic expansion. To enhance the theoretical framework, the Eisenhart lift method was introduced, providing a geometric interpretation of the system by embedding the dynamical variables within an extended field space. This approach established a connection between the kinetic terms and Killing vectors, offering an alternative perspective on the conserved quantities. The study also derived geodesic equations governing the evolution of the system, reinforcing the link between symmetry-based techniques and fundamental cosmological properties.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an explicit expression for the inverse of the symmetric bilinear form of Virasoro Verma modules, the so-called Shapovalov form, in terms of singular vector operators and their conformal dimensions. Our proposed expression also determines the resolution of the identity for Verma modules of the Virasoro algebra, and can be thus employed in the computation of Virasoro conformal blocks via the sewing procedure.</description>

      <title>Atomic Higgsings of 6D SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the full Higgs branch Hasse diagram for any given 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ SCFT constructed via F-theory. This can be done by a procedure of determining all the minimal Higgsings on the generalized quiver of the 6d SCFT. We call this procedure the atomic Higgsing, which can be implemented iteratively. We present our general algorithms with many concrete examples of Hasse diagrams. We also compare our algorithm with the Higgsings determined by the 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ magnetic quivers. For the cases where the magnetic quivers are unitary, we can reproduce the full Hasse diagrams. We also construct the orthosymplectic magnetic quivers from the Type IIA brane systems for some new examples. Our approach, based on F-theory, applies to the known and new orthosymplectic cases, as well as theories that do not have known descriptions in terms of magnetic quivers. We expect our geometry-based approach to help extend the horizon of the RG flows of the 6d SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Toric gravitational instantons in gauged supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general class of toric gravitational instantons in $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity, namely Euclidean supersymmetric solutions with $U(1)^2$ isometry. Such solutions are specified by a "supergravity labelled polytope", where the labels encode the 4-manifold topology, the choice of magnetic fluxes, and certain signs associated to the Killing spinor. Equivariant localization then allows us to write down the gravitational free energy for such a solution, assuming it exists, and study its properties. These results open the way for a systematic study of holography in this setting, where the dual large $N$ field theories are defined on the boundary 3-manifolds, which are (squashed) lens spaces $L(p,q)$ or generalizations with orbifold singularities.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Harmonic, Holomorphic and Rational Maps from Self-Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup ${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere $SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up the way for applications of such ans\"atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrme theory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction is based on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$ from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such a mathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a way that makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological (homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct first order partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutions also solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic map energy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturate a lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitute the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constitute harmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of the rational map ans\"atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We apply our results to construct approximate Skyrme solutions for the $SU(N)$ Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Probability Distribution for Vacuum Energy Flux Fluctuations in Two Spacetime Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in two dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on probability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal field theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be averaged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging function. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which include the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy flux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the distribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the flux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct from the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution of energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy density. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on the energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Euclidean AdS wormholes and gravitational instantons in the Einstein-Skyrme theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean AdS wormholes provide a natural setup for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence with multiple boundaries. However, from a bottom-up perspective, they cannot be embedded in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Maxwell theory if these boundaries have positive curvature. Nevertheless, Maldacena and Maoz showed that this obstruction could be circumvented by introducing merons in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Yang-Mills theory. In this work, we show that Euclidean-AdS wormholes also exist in the four-dimensional Einstein-AdS-Skyrme theory, whose matter sector possesses a nontrivial baryonic charge. We compute its free energy and show that it does not depend on the integration constants whatsoever, resembling topological solitons. Additionally, we obtain its holographic stress tensor and show that it vanishes, allowing us to interpret this configuration as a holographic Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) state. Other topologically nontrivial ground states in Einstein-Skyrme theory are found, such as gravitational instantons, representing the homotopically inequivalent vacua of the theory. We find that they develop Hawking-Page phase transitions above a critical temperature. Some of these solutions are periodic in Euclidean time, representing the gravitational analog of calorons in Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Logging the conformal life of Ramanujan's $\pi$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1914, Ramanujan presented 17 infinite series for $1/\pi$. We examine the physics origin of these remarkable formulae by connecting them to 2D logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs) which arise in various contexts such as the fractional quantum hall effect, percolation and polymers. In light of the LCFT connection, we investigate such infinite series in terms of the physics data, i.e., the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients of the CFT and the conformal block expansion. These considerations lead to novel approximations for $1/\pi$. The rapid convergence of the Ramanujan series motivates us to take advantage of the crossing symmetry of the LCFT correlators to find new and efficient representations. To achieve this, we use the parametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation which was recently developed for string amplitudes. Quite strikingly, we find remarkable simplifications in the new representations, where, in the Legendre relation, the entire contribution to $1/\pi$ comes from the logarithmic identity operator, hinting at a universal property of LCFTs. Additionally, the dispersive representation gives us a new handle on the double-lightcone limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine all toric phases for the $2d$ $(0,2)$ theories on D1-branes probing the complex cones over the 18 smooth Fano 3-folds, whose toric diagrams correspond to the regular reflexive polytopes in 3 dimensions. These results significantly expand the list of explicitly known gauge theories on D1-branes over toric CY 4-folds. We go beyond the classification of toric phases and map the corresponding triality webs, establishing how the toric phases are connected by triality. The size and complexity of the webs constructed in this work far surpass any previously known examples, both in the contexts of Calabi-Yau 3-folds and 4-folds-with several of these CY 4-folds exhibiting hundreds of toric phases. We propose various new approaches for characterizing triality webs. Our work lays the foundation for a comprehensive exploration of the structure of triality webs.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a method of reverse holography by which a bulk metric is shown to arise from locally computable multiscale correlations of a boundary quantum field theory (QFT). The metric is obtained from the Petz-R\'enyi mutual information using as input the correlations computed from the continuous wavelet transform. We show for free massless fermionic and bosonic QFTs that the emerging metric is asymptotically anti-de Sitter space (AdS), and that the parameters fixing the geometry are tunable by changing the chosen wavelet basis. The method is applicable to a variety of boundary QFTs that need not be conformal field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general class of scalar-teleparallel theories, which are based on a scalar field which is coupled to a flat connection with torsion and nonmetricity, and study its post-Newtonian limit using the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism. We find that among this class there are theories whose post-Newtonian limit fully agrees with general relativity; for others only the parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ deviate from their general relativity values $\beta = \gamma = 1$, while all other parameters remain the same, thus preserving total momentum conservation, local Lorentz invariance and local position invariance; finally, we also find theories whose post-Newtonian limit is pathological. Our main result is a full classification of the proposed theories into these different cases. We apply our findings to a number of simpler classes of theories and show that for these a subset of the aforementioned cases can be found.</description>

      <title>Embezzlement of entanglement, quantum fields, and the classification of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07299v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum information theoretic task of embezzlement of entanglement in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Given a shared entangled resource state, this task asks to produce arbitrary entangled states using local operations without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. We quantify the performance of a given resource state by the worst-case error. States for which the latter vanishes are 'embezzling states' as they allow to embezzle arbitrary entangled states with arbitrarily small error. The best and worst performance among all states defines two algebraic invariants for von Neumann algebras. The first invariant takes only two values. Either it vanishes and embezzling states exist, which can only happen in type III, or no state allows for nontrivial embezzlement. In the case of factors not of finite type I, the second invariant equals the diameter of the state space. This provides a quantitative operational interpretation of Connes' classification of type III factors within quantum information theory. Type III$_1$ factors are 'universal embezzlers' where every state is embezzling. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum field theory, where type III algebras naturally appear. For instance, they explain the maximal violation of Bell inequalities in the vacuum. Our results follow from a one-to-one correspondence between embezzling states and invariant probability measures on the flow of weights. We also establish that universally embezzling ITPFI factors are of type III$_1$ by elementary arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The {\Lambda}CDM model has long served as a robust and predictive framework for cosmology, successfully explaining a wide range of observations, including the accelerated expansion of the Universe. However, discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and recent findings, such as those from DESI, hint at potential deviations from {\Lambda}CDM. Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer an independent method to probe the nature of dark energy, leveraging GWs from compact binary mergers as standard candles. In this study, we demonstrate that the integrated GW memory over cosmological distances encodes a unique imprint of the background spacetime. Unlike previous analyses, our approach captures non-linear dependencies on cosmological quantities, resulting in an enhancement of the integrated GW memory by a factor of 100 for high-redshift sources well within the sensitivity range of next-generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. We find that despite the diminishing strength of individual GWs at high redshifts, their cumulative effect leads to a significant amplification, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, offering a potential new avenue for cosmological studies. By examining a range of dark energy models, we reveal that GW memory is potentially highly sensitive to the underlying cosmological framework, making it a promising probe of dark energy. This novel approach presents the possibility of a fresh perspective to address persistent cosmological tensions, and the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from generic dynamics in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <title>QuanEstimation.jl: An open-source Julia framework for quantum parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4 (4) (2022) 043057]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration under random unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out-of-equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterising the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, new insight came by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high level, observable-independent probe. Until now this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g. U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterise the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of "generic" many-body dynamics, i.e. a local random unitary circuit, where our method leads to exact results. We show that the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on time-scales proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalisation time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the so-called "quantum Mpemba effect", where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric. We provide the first exact characterisation of this effect in a non-integrable system.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a nonlinear electromagnetic generalization of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational signatures of a nonlinear electromagnetic extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution. We conduct an analysis of light propagation, focusing on the photon sphere, shadow formation, and geodesic trajectories in this spacetime. The constraints on the parameter $\xi$, which characterizes the nonlinear extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, are derived from observational data provided by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The time delay effects are also considered. In the thermodynamic analysis, we examine the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, and the emission of Hawking radiation via the tunneling process. The remnant mass and evaporation time of the black hole at its final stage are estimated. In addition, we compute the quasinormal modes using the WKB approximation, taking into account the characteristic oscillations of the system under scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations. Additionally, the time-domain solution is analyzed for all these perturbations to examine their evolution over time.</description>

      <title>Investigating the universality of five-point QCD scattering amplitudes at high energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate $2 \to 3$ QCD scattering amplitudes in multi-Regge kinematics, i.e. where the final partons are strongly ordered in rapidity. In this regime amplitudes exhibit intriguing factorisation properties which can be understood in terms of effective degrees of freedom called \emph{reggeons}. Working within the Balitsky/JIMWLK framework, we predict these amplitudes for the first time to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order, and compare against the limit of QCD scattering amplitudes in full colour and kinematics. We find that the latter can be described in terms of universal objects, and that the apparent non-universality arising at NNLL comes from well-defined and under-control contributions that we can predict. Thanks to this observation, we extract for the first time the universal vertex that controls the emission of the central-rapidity gluon, both in QCD and $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>Alternative Framework to Quantize Fermionic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is extended to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that allows us to obtain the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian is verified to generate the Poincar\'{e} algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>
