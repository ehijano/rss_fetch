      <title>Coupled-channel scattering of $DD, DD^*$ and $D^* D^*$ in isospin-$1$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first coupled-channel determination of two-body $D$ and $D^*$ scattering amplitudes in isospin-$1$ from lattice quantum chromodynamics is presented. Using three lattice volumes at $m_\pi \approx 391~\mathrm{MeV}$, finite-volume energies relevant for the channels of interest are determined. Through the L\"uscher formalism, these energies are used to constrain amplitudes of coupled $J^P=0^+$ $DD - DD^*$, $J^P=1^+$ $DD^*- D^*D^*$ and $J^P=2^+$ $DD - DD^* - D^* D^*$ scattering. All channels feature weakly repulsive interactions in $S$ wave, except for a weak $D^* D^*$ attraction in $J^P=0^+$. No amplitude singularities corresponding to physical states are found. Some of these amplitudes will be a necessary component of future lattice QCD analyses of $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering taking into account three-body and left-hand cut effects.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00200</link>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>What is the Curvature of 2D Euclidean Quantum Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the nonperturbative curvature properties of two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity, obtained as the scaling limit of a path integral over dynamical triangulations of a two-sphere, which lies in the same universality class as Liouville quantum gravity. The diffeomorphism-invariant observable that allows us to compare the averaged curvature of highly quantum-fluctuating geometries with that of classical spaces is the so-called curvature profile. A Monte Carlo analysis on three geometric ensembles, which are physically equivalent but differ by the inclusion of local degeneracies, leads to new insights on the influence of finite-size effects. After eliminating them, we find strong evidence that the curvature profile of 2D Euclidean quantum gravity is best matched by that of a classical round four-sphere, rather than the five-sphere found in previous work. Our analysis suggests the existence of a well-defined quantum Ricci curvature in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics from Quantum Cellular Automata, and the Tension Between Symmetry, Locality and Positive Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose lattice quantum cellular automata theories derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space but a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the quantum cellular automaton theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of quantum cellular automata, and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of quantum cellular automata seems to require a nonzero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.</description>
