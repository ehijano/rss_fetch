      <title>EGaIn tube memristors offer reliable switching on a biological time scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristive devices have been considered promising candidates for nature-inspired computing and in-memory information processing. However, experimental devices developed to date typically show significant variability and function at different time scales than biological neurons and synapses. This study presents a new kind of memristive device comprised of liquid-metal eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) contained within a mm-scale tube that operates via a bulk, voltage-dependent switching mechanism and exhibits distinct unipolar resistive switching characteristics that occur on a biological time scale (tens of milliseconds). The switching mechanism involves voltage-controlled growth and dissolution of an oxide layer on the surface of the liquid metal in contact with an aqueous electrolyte. Through comprehensive measurements on many devices, we observed remarkably consistent cycle-to-cycle behavior and uniformity in the voltage-controlled memristance. We present our findings, which also include an experimental demonstration of logic gates utilizing EGaIn tube memristors. Furthermore, we observe both accelerated and decelerated switching behaviors and identify signatures indicative of a fractional dynamic response.</description>

      <title>Precision optomechanical accelerometer via hybrid test mass integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerometers offer motion sensing capabilities across a wide range of areas, enabling navigational awareness in consumer goods and defense applications, and playing a key role in monitoring and control systems. To date, on-chip accelerometers have largely utilized a single device layer or substrate as a test mass. This constrains the test mass to the dimensions and density of the device layer or substrate, ultimately limiting the sensitivity of the device. We demonstrate a new approach which utilizes a pick-and-place bonding technique to increase the test mass of an on-chip accelerometer. By bonding a high-density platinum sphere to a nanomechanical silicon nitride trampoline membrane, we achieve a quality factor of 1900 in air with 95 mg test mass, corresponding to a thermomechanical noise limited acceleration sensitivity of $0.8\,\mathrm{n}g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. We optically probe the device's response to applied accelerations with increasing level of acoustic and vibration isolation, measuring a peak sensitivity of $5.5\,\mathrm{n}g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 117 Hz in air, limited by environmental vibrations. This represents the best peak sensitivity reported using a chip-integrated test mass.</description>

      <title>Wave-based quasi-digital logic operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave-based computing has emerged as an exciting paradigm with the potential to enable high-speed, parallel operations. In conventional computing, elementary logic gates, such as AND, OR, NOT and XOR, form the building blocks of larger interconnected logic circuits. These operations are inherently non-linear processes, which may be challenging to implement using an electromagnetic wave-matter based systems. In this work, we discuss how one may instead emulate the functionality of certain logic gates by using quasi-digital linear systems (in this case networks of interconnected parallel plate waveguides). This is done by carefully designing the encoding scheme of the input bits (how the input state of each bit maps to an incident electromagnetic signal) and the high/low classification regions of the output signal. To demonstrate this approach, full-wave numerical simulation of elementary 2-input operations are presented. This technique is then extended to many-to-one and many-to-many operations such as an N-input AND, half, full and a 2-bit full-adder. We envision that this quasi-digital linear computing technique may help enable new opportunities for electromagnetic wave-based computing.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the loading capacity of a carrier-based DPI formulation and its dependence on the blending process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-segregating ordered powder mixtures constituted by a coarse carrier fraction and finer components are at the basis of dry powders for inhalation pharmaceuticas. The estimation of the loading capacity, i.e. how many fines can be hosted on each carrier particle, is crucial to grant the product quality through a reproducible and affordable manufacturing process. We propose an approach based on the combination of sieve analysis, optical microscopy and powder bed permeability to quantify the loading capacity and understand the fines behavior, the impact of the mixing process was also investigated. We tested the method on model binary mixtures composed only of a coarse lactose carrier and micronized lactose fines as a surrogate of a real active pharmaceutical ingredient. The results provided by the different methods are consistent, the approach proved to be accurate and reproducible. The effect of different mixing parameters and equipment on the loading capacity is also discussed.</description>

      <title>High temporal stability of niobium superconducting resonators by surface passivation with organophosphonate self-assembled monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One main limiting factor towards achieving high coherence times in superconducting circuits is two level system (TLS) losses. Mitigating such losses requires controlling the formation of native oxides at the metal-air interface. Here, we report the growth of alkyl-phosphonate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Nb thin films following oxide removal. The impact of passivation was evaluated via the performance of coplanar waveguide resonators at 10mK, in terms of quality factor and resonant frequency, over six days of air exposure. Un-passivated resonators exhibited an ~80% increase in loss at single-photon power levels, whereas SAM-passivated resonators maintained excellent temporal stability, attributed to suppressed oxide regrowth. By employing a two-component TLS model, we discern distinct prominent loss channels for each resonator type and quantified the characteristic TLS loss of the SAMs to be ~5x10^-7. We anticipate our passivation methodology to offer a promising route toward industrial-scale qubit fabrication, particularly where long-term device stability is critical.</description>

      <title>Energy-Information Trade-Off in Self-Directed Channel Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of information storage on memristors is vital to enable their use in novel data storage and neuromorphic applications. One key consideration in information storage is the energy cost of storage and what impact the available energy has on the information capacity of the devices. In this paper, we propose and study an energy-information trade-off for a particular kind of memristive device - Self-Directed Channel (SDC) memristors. We perform experiments to model the energy required to set the devices into various states, as well as assessing the stability of these states over time. Based on these results, we employ a generative modelling approach, using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to characterise the storage conditional distribution, allowing us to estimate energy-information curves for a range of storage delays, showing the graceful trade-off between energy consumed and the effective capacity of the devices.</description>

      <title>First-principles many-body study for electronic, optical, and excitonic properties of RbTlCl3 perovskite for solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed many-body ab initio study of the valence-skipper RbTlCl$_{3}$ perovskite compound for photovoltaic (PV) applications. The electronic and optical properties, both with and without spin-orbit coupling, have been calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and many-body excited-state calculations. The band gap, which is indirect in nature, is found to be 0.95 eV and 0.89 eV from PBE and PBEsol, respectively. The optical properties have been computed using four different approximations: independent particle approximation (IPA), IPA with scissor correction (IQPA), random phase approximation for local-field effects (LFEs), and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The estimated highest value of the imaginary part of the dielectric function using IQPA is 7 at 2 eV, which slightly decreases to 5.7 due to LFEs. Within BSE, the peak value is obtained to be maximum at 1.6 eV with a magnitude of 10.8, which indicates the strong excitonic effect below the optical gap. Large number of bright and dark bound excitons are found, where the binding energies of four main bound bright excitons are found in the range of 299-350 meV. The exciton amplitude in both reciprocal and real space is analyzed. The main bound bright exciton is localized in the reciprocal space, while this exhibits a delocalized nature in real space. The BSE predicts a highest absorption coefficient of 3.6 $\times$ $10^{6}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1.7 eV, while a minimum reflectivity in the active region of the solar energy spectrum is obtained to be around 2.7\%. Finally, the solar efficiency has been estimated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency approach and obtained highest value is 15.5% at a thickness of 0.5 $\mu$m. These findings reveal a significant excitonic effect in the absorption spectra of RbTlCl$_{3}$ and highlight its potential as a promising material for single-junction thin-film solar cells.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Resilient Reconfigurable PUF with Dual-Pulse Modulation based on SOT-MRAM Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, hardware-based security solutions have become an emerging choice for enhancing end-terminal information security. As one of the hardware technologies, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) utilize the inherent variations in the manufacturing process to generate cryptographic keys. Reconfigurable PUFs (rPUFs), characterized by updating cryptographic keys, offer enhanced security ability for protecting massive amounts of data in dynamic operational scenarios. The core challenge lies in achieving real-time reconfiguration independent of environmental conditions, particularly operating temperature, which has rarely been investigated and addressed. In this study, we propose a dual-pulse reconfiguration strategy based on SOT-MRAM carriers, which effectively widens the operating window and exhibits excellent PUF metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our design achieves real-time reconfiguration across industrial-grade operating temperature ranges, without the need for dynamic feedback of real-time temperature. The proposed SOT-MRAM rPUF design lays a solid foundation for next-generation IoT protection architectures.</description>

      <title>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that not only includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) but also accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</description>

Abstract: Fluorite structure ferroelectrics, especially hafnium oxide, are widely investigated for their application in non-volatile memories, sensors, actuators, RF devices and energy harvesters. Due to the metastable nature of the ferroelectric phase in these materials, dopants and process parameters need to be optimized for its stabilization. Here, we present clear evidence of how dopants affect the properties in this material system and solutions to achieve improved reliability, desired crystallization behavior and polarization hysteresis shape/position through co-doping. Finally, the benefits of co-doping in a variety of application fields are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Synchronization driven reciprocity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method to break wave transmission reciprocity by leveraging the synchronization of self-oscillators. An experimental demonstration with aeroacoustic cavities is presented. They behave as weakly nonlinear limit cycles when driven by a constant airflow, leading to self-oscillations which can couple to the surrounding waveguides via two ports. Incident waves from one port trigger anti-phase synchronization, causing destructive interference and low transmission, while waves from the opposite port induce in-phase synchronization, resulting in high transmission. This directional dependence effectively breaks reciprocity, where the operational bandwidth is defined by the synchronization region (Arnold tongue), and can be broader than resonance based methods. Experimental results show robust nonreciprocal behavior w.r.t. parameter changes. Moreover, a modified temporal coupled mode theory is proposed, explaining the system's nonlinear dynamics and scattering properties in a quantitative manner. This synchronization-based approach offers a new avenue for directional wave control, complementing traditional reciprocity breaking techniques, and offering an intrinsic loss-compensation emanating from the self-oscillation of meta-atoms.</description>

      <title>Synchronization driven acoustics: The nonlinear scattering of a self-oscillating meta-atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we demonstrate a self-oscillating acoustic meta-atom functioning as an amplifying transistor, where a steady external flow serves as a control signal to switch between reflective (off-state) and transmissive (on-state) regimes. In the on-state, an acoustic limit cycle synchronizes with incident sound waves. This process governs the energy transfer across the device, with a transmission bandwidth dictated by the synchronization region in parameter space (Arnold tongue). Our experimental measurements reveal nonlinear dependence on the incident wave amplitude, enabling perturbation filtering therein and stabilizing downstream acoustic power. All experimentally observed phenomena are quantitatively described by a nonlinear Li\'enard-type oscillator featuring saturable gain and linear loss, where the essential parameters can be estimated by independent measurements. This work may offer a paradigm shift in acoustic metamaterials research by leveraging self-oscillation and synchronization processes. Bridging those key concepts from nonlinear dynamics and complex systems with active metamaterial design in acoustics and related disciplines, may establish a broadly applicable framework of field-independent mechanisms for wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Mechanical non-reciprocity programmed by shear jamming in soft composite solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical non-reciprocity-manifested as asymmetric responses to opposing mechanical stimuli-has traditionally been achieved through intricate structural nonlinearities in metamaterials. However, continuum solids with inherent non-reciprocal mechanics remain underexplored, despite their promising potential for applications such as wave guiding, robotics, and adaptive materials. Here, we introduce a design principle by employing the shear jamming transition from granular physics to engineer non-reciprocal mechanics in soft composite solids. Through the control of the interplay between inclusion contact networks and matrix elasticity, we achieve tunable, direction-dependent asymmetry in both shear and normal mechanical responses. In addition to static regimes, we demonstrate programmable non-reciprocal dynamics by combining responsive magnetic profiles with the anisotropic characteristics of shear-jammed systems. This strategy enables asymmetric spatiotemporal control over motion transmission, a previously challenging feat in soft materials. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for designing non-reciprocal matter, bridging granular physics with soft material engineering to realize functionalities essential for mechano-intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Super-capacitors interfaced with quantum dots at the electrolyte/electrode interface: capacitance gain and fluorescence line-width narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs), embedded in supercapacitors (S-C) cells exhibited capacitance amplification that peaked at certain QD concentration. More than 2.5 peak amplification was demonstrated with cyclic voltammetry (C-V) at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s. The mass ratio of the dots to that of the active-carbon electrode (A-C) was less than 1:5000. Fluorescence signals from dry (without electrolyte) and wet (with electrolyte) samples, exhibited a correlated, substantial peak enhancement vs QD concentration, as well. In the case of wet samples, fluorescence line narrowing was demonstrated, which indicates a substantial fluorescence gain. Both effects are attributed to local field effects through formation of a colloidal array at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Embedding QDs at the electrolyte/electrode interface has an added value that it may be further enhanced by white light and indeed this is the case here. Probing the electrolyte/electrode interface with fluorescing materials adds to our basic knowledge of the interface and could be useful for light-sensitive S-C cells.</description>
