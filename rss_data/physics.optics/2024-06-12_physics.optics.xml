      <title>Full transmission of vectorial waves through 3D multiple-scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A striking prediction from the random matrix theory in mesoscopic physics is the existence of "open channels": waves that can use multipath interference to achieve perfect transmission across an opaque disordered medium even in the multiple-scattering regime. Realization of such open channels requires a coherent control of the complete incident wavefront. To date, the open channels have only been demonstrated in scalar two-dimensional (2D) structures, both experimentally and with numerical studies. Here, we utilize a recently proposed "augmented partial factorization" full-wave simulation method to compute the scattering matrix from 3D vectorial Maxwell's equations and demonstrate the existence of open channels in 3D disordered media. We examine the spatial profile of such open channels, demonstrate the existence of a bimodal transmission eigenvalue distribution with full control, and study the effects of incomplete polarization control and of a finite illumination area. This study confirms the validity of the random matrix theory in vectorial systems. The simulation framework provides full access to the complex multi-channel wave transport in 3D disordered systems, filling the gap left by experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Poincar\'e Spheres and Spatio-Spectral Poincar\'e Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of fundamental optics effects has been stimulated through the increasing ability to structure light in all its degrees of freedom (DOFs) in sophisticated but simple experimental settings. However, with such an increase in experimental capabilities, it has also become important to study theoretical descriptions for a more intuitive understanding of the underlying concepts. Here, we introduce a visual representation of light that is structured in its transverse space, frequency, and polarization in the form of a higher-order Poincar\'e sphere and discuss interesting links to its fundamental counterpart. We further leverage this connection to discuss and experimentally generate light possessing all possible polarization states across its spatio-spectral shape, which we term spatio-spectral Poincar\'e beams. By invoking all DOFs of light in the powerful description of higher-order Poincar\'e spheres, our work can pave the way for a deeper understanding and beneficial application of structured light as a powerful tool in optics.</description>

      <title>Electric and magnetic toroidal dipole excitations in core-shell spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal dipole moments, which consist of enclosed circulating currents aligned along paths within a torus shape, can be experimentally achieved in metamaterials using various geometrical configurations. Here, we investigate the excitation of toroidal dipole moments in a core-shell nanosphere composed of dispersive materials within the framework of the Lorenz-Mie theory. By isolating the contributions related to volumetric oscillations of electric charges from those of transverse and radial current oscillations, we derive closed-form analytic expressions for the scattering coefficients associated with electric and magnetic toroidal dipole moments. These analytic expressions, obtained beyond the Rayleigh scattering regime and previously concealed within the Lorenz-Mie theory, agree with the Cartesian toroidal dipoles determined from the radial and transverse current oscillations. By exploring the resonances in these calculated coefficients, we demonstrate that the electric and magnetic toroidal dipole excitations can be manipulated and tuned for near- and far-field applications involving plasmonic core-shell nanoparticles and engineered metamaterials. We believe that our analytic results could shed light on some of the extraordinary effects obtained in Lorenz-Mie theory that depend on the interference of multipole coefficients, such as toroidal dipole-induced transparency, Fano resonances and superscattering of light.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Membrane-Based Scanning Force Microscopy Through an Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new generation of strained silicon nitride resonators harbors great promise for scanning force microscopy, especially when combined with the extensive toolbox of cavity optomechanics. However, accessing a mechanical resonator inside an optical cavity with a scanning tip is challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a cavity-based scanning force microscope based on a silicon nitride membrane sensor. We overcome geometric constraints by making use of the extended nature of the mechanical resonator normal modes, which allows us to spatially separate the scanning and readout sites of the membrane. Our microscope is geared towards low-temperature applications in the zeptonewton regime, such as nanoscale nuclear spin detection and imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical and hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) recently have become of increasing interest to achieve low-latency, low-power image classification and computer vision tasks. However, implementing optical nonlinearity is challenging, and omitting the nonlinear layers in a standard CNN comes at a significant reduction in accuracy. In this work, we use knowledge distillation to compress modified AlexNet to a single linear convolutional layer and an electronic backend (two fully connected layers). We obtain comparable performance to a purely electronic CNN with five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. We implement the convolution optically via engineering the point spread function of an inverse-designed meta-optic. Using this hybrid approach, we estimate a reduction in multiply-accumulate operations from 688M in a conventional electronic modified AlexNet to only 86K in the hybrid compressed network enabled by the optical frontend. This constitutes a four orders of magnitude reduction in latency and power consumption. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that the classification accuracy of the system exceeds 93\% on the MNIST dataset.</description>

      <title>A high-performance reconstruction method for partially coherent ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography is now integrated as a tool in mainstream microscopy allowing quantitative and high-resolution imaging capabilities over a wide field of view. However, its ultimate performance is inevitably limited by the available coherent flux when implemented using electrons or laboratory X-ray sources. We present a universal reconstruction algorithm with high tolerance to low coherence for both far-field and near-field ptychography. The approach is practical for partial temporal and spatial coherence and requires no prior knowledge of the source properties. Our initial visible-light and electron data show that the method can dramatically improve the reconstruction quality and accelerate the convergence rate of the reconstruction. The approach also integrates well into existing ptychographic engines. It can also improve mixed-state and numerical monochromatisation methods, requiring a smaller number of coherent modes or lower dimensionality of Krylov subspace while providing more stable and faster convergence. We propose that this approach could have significant impact on ptychography of weakly scattering samples.</description>

      <title>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and unified non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially-localized edge modes, has led to numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to the traditional exponential localization, this manuscript reports a new kind of non-Hermitian skin effect, which we term the ``algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect." This effect emerges across a diverse spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in both two- and higher space dimensions. For 2D systems with algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect, on geometries such as a torus or cylinder, these systems exhibit behavior reminiscent of the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenmodes are either bulk Bloch waves (on a torus) or exponentially localized edge modes (on a cylinder). However, if the same system is placed on a disk or any geometrical shape featuring open boundaries in all directions, the skin modes immediately transform into the algebraic form, with amplitude decaying as a power-law function of the distance from the boundary. To explore these novel effects, we formulate a unified generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) framework that is universally applicable to all variations of non-Hermitian skin effects across any spatial dimension, developed through the usage of a generalized transfer-matrix approach. We find that in a $d$-dimensional non-Hermitian system, in general, the GBZ manifold's dimensionality must fall into the range from $d$ to $2d-1$, denoted by ${d \leq \dim\text{GBZ} \leq 2d-1}$. In 1D, this inequality is trivial because the upper and lower bounds converge, forcing the GBZ's dimensionality to match with that of the physical space. However, in 2D and above, this inequality indicates that there is no obligation for the GBZ's dimensionality to concur with the physical space's dimensionality, which gives rise to a new class of non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <title>Alignment and Optimisation of Optical Tweezers on Trapped Ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a routine to align an optical tweezer on a single trapped ion and use the ion as a probe to characterize the tweezer. We find a smallest tweezer waist of $2.3(2)\,\mu$m, which is in agreement with the theoretical minimal attainable waist of $2.5(2)\,\mu$m in our setup. We characterize the spatial dependence of the tweezer Rabi frequency which is suppressed by a factor of 19(3) in the immediate surrounding of the ion. We investigate the effects of optical forces and coherent population trapping on the ion. Finally, we show that the challenges posed by these forces can be overcome, and that the number of tweezers can be easily scaled up to reach several ions by using a spatial light modulator.</description>

      <title>Hidden correlations in stochastic photoinduced dynamics of a solid-state electrolyte</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoexcitation by ultrashort laser pulses plays a crucial role in controlling reaction pathways, creating nonequilibrium material properties, and offering a microscopic view of complex dynamics at the molecular level. The photo response following a laser pulse is, in general, non-identical between multiple exposures due to spatiotemporal fluctuations in a material or the stochastic nature of dynamical pathways. However, most ultrafast experiments using a stroboscopic pump-probe scheme struggle to distinguish intrinsic sample fluctuations from extrinsic apparatus noise, often missing seemingly random deviations from the averaged shot-to-shot response. Leveraging the stability and high photon-flux of time-resolved X-ray micro-diffraction at a synchrotron, we developed a method to quantitatively characterize the shot-to-shot variation of the photoinduced dynamics in a solid-state electrolyte. By analyzing temporal evolutions of the lattice parameter of a single grain in a powder ensemble, we found that the sample responses after different shots contain random fluctuations that are, however, not independent. Instead, there is a correlation between the nonequilibrium lattice trajectories following adjacent laser shots with a characteristic "correlation length" of approximately 1,500 shots, which represents an energy barrier of 0.38~eV for switching the photoinduced pathway, a value interestingly commensurate with the activation energy of lithium ion diffusion. Not only does our nonequilibrium noise correlation spectroscopy provide a new strategy for studying fluctuations that are central to phase transitions in both condensed matter and molecular systems, it also paves the way for discovering hidden correlations and novel metastable states buried in oft-presumed random, uncorrelated fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition in fluctuating imaginary gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the exact solvability and point-gap topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian lattice models. These models incorporate site-dependent nonreciprocal hoppings $J e^{\pm g_n}$, facilitated by a spatially fluctuating imaginary gauge field $ig_n \hat~x$ that disrupts translational symmetry. By employing suitable imaginary gauge transformations, it is revealed that a lattice characterized by any given $g_n$ is spectrally equivalent to a lattice devoid of fields, under open boundary conditions. Furthermore, a system with closed boundaries can be simplified to a spectrally equivalent lattice featuring a uniform mean field $i\bar{g}\hat~x$. This framework offers a comprehensive method for analytically predicting spectral topological invariance and associated boundary localization phenomena for bond-disordered nonperiodic lattices. These predictions are made by analyzing gauge-transformed isospectral periodic lattices. Notably, for a lattice with quasiperiodic $g_n= \ln |\lambda \cos 2\pi \alpha n|$ and an irrational $\alpha$, a previously unknown topological phase transition is unveiled. It is observed that the topological spectral index $W$ assumes values of $-N$ or $+N$, leading to all $N$ open-boundary eigenstates localizing either at the right or left edge, solely dependent on the strength of the gauge field, where $\lambda&lt;2$ or $\lambda&gt;2$. A phase transition is identified at the critical point $\lambda\approx2$, at which all eigenstates undergo delocalization. The theory has been shown to be relevant for long-range hopping models and for higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources as it prepares the exciton state, defines the decay dynamics, and influences the spectral diffusion of the emitted single photons. Here, we investigate the impact of different optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission characteristics of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Under phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow and stable single-photon emission with an excellent purity reaching $ 0.94\pm 0.02\,$. Furthermore, the decay time is reduced by more than an order of magnitude from $(16.65 \pm 2.39)\,$ns for above-band excitation to $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns for phonon-assisted excitation. Finally, we observe a suppressed spectral wandering along with a two-fold reduction of the spectral linewidth. Our comprehensive investigation highlights the critical role of the excitation method in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of birefringence inhomogeneity of KAGRA sapphire mirrors from transmitted wavefront error measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooling down test masses to cryogenic temperatures is a way to reduce the thermal noise of gravitational wave detectors. Crystalline materials are considered the most promising materials for fabricating cryogenic test masses and their coatings because of their excellent thermal and optical properties at low temperatures. However, birefringence owing to local impurities and inhomogeneities in the crystal can degrade the performance of the detector. The birefringence measurement or mapping over a two-dimensional area is thus important. This study describes a method for fast birefringence measurements of a large sample by simply combining a series of transmission wavefront error measurements using linearly polarised light with Fizeau interferometers. Using this method, the birefringence inhomogeneity information of KAGRA's two input test masses with a diameter of 22 cm was fully reconstructed. The birefringence information was then used to calculate the transverse beam shapes of the light fields in orthogonal polarisation directions when passing through the substrate. It was possible to find a calculated beam shape consistent with in-situ measurements using the KAGRA interferometer. This technique is crucial for birefringence characterisation of test masses in future detectors, where even larger sizes are used.</description>

Abstract: Access to eye care can be expanded with high-throughput, easy-to-use, and portable diagnostic tools. Phase mask encoded imaging could improve these aspects of the fundus camera by enabling computational refocusing without any moving parts. This approach circumvents the need to adjust lenses to compensate for refractive errors. We developed a computational fundus camera by introducing a holographic diffuser at the plane conjugate to the ocular pupil, resulting in a laterally shift-invariant point spread function. We demonstrate computational refocusing of a model eye fundus over a large range of defocus errors. We also show computationally refocused, color, in vivo, human fundus images with a $\geq$35-degree field-of-view (FOV). This technology could eventually be combined with the wavefront-sensing capabilities of phase mask encoded imaging to create a compact ophthalmic imaging system that simultaneously captures a fundus image and performs aberrometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the biophysical and biochemical properties of molecular nanocarriers under physiological conditions and with minimal interference is crucial for advancing nanomedicine, photopharmacology, drug delivery, nanotheranostics and synthetic biology. Yet, analytical methods struggle to combine precise chemical imaging and measurements without perturbative labeling. This challenge is exemplified for azobenzene-based photoswitchable lipids, which are intriguing reagents for controlling nanocarrier properties on fast timescales, enabling, e.g., precise light-induced drug release processes. Here, we leverage the chemical recognition and high spatio-temporal resolution of scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) to demonstrate non-destructive, label-free mid-infrared (MIR) imaging and spectroscopy of photoswitchable liposomes below the diffraction limit and the tracking of their dynamics down to 50 ms resolution. The vesicles are adsorbed on an ultrathin 10-nm SiN membrane, which separates the sample space from the tip space for stable and hour-long observations. By implementing a transient nanoscopy approach, we accurately resolve, for the first time, photoinduced changes in both the shape and the MIR spectral signature of individual vesicles and reveal abrupt change dynamics of the underlying photoisomerization process. Our findings highlight the methods potential for future studies on the complex dynamics of unlabeled nanoscale soft matter, as well as, in a broader context, for host-guest systems, energy materials or drugs.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative two-core fiber (TCF) optic sensor employing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) to monitor the optogenetic response of light-sensitive human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). The in-fiber MZI, formed using a segment of TCF optic, detects refractive index (RI) changes in the surrounding medium. The sensor utilizes the evanescent wave of one core as the sensing arm, necessitating a thin cladding achieved through one-sided chemical etching. This design allows the sensor to detect subtle alterations in the RI of the environment by observing displacements in the interference spectrum. The optogenetic stimulation of light-sensitive cells induces variations in ion concentrations, leading to a corresponding change in refractive index. The fabricated sensor, with a peak sensitivity of 675.74 nm/RIU within the RI range of 1.39-1.43, can detect these changes. A computer simulation validated the sensitivity and optimized fabrication parameters, exhibiting satisfactory agreement with experimental results. Spectrum displacements were recorded for both light-sensitive hDPSCs and regular hDPSCs (as a control test). Results from the experiment, analyzed and compared using data analysis software, revealed that 473 nm blue light effectively stimulated light-sensitive hDPSCs. Notably, the proposed sensor, a novel structure, demonstrated its capability to detect RI changes in the cell medium during optogenetic applications.</description>

      <title>Propagation of a Gaussian Wigner Function Through a Matrix-Aperture Beamline</title>

Abstract: In the framework of statistical optics, a Wigner function represents partially coherent radiation. A Gaussian Wigner function, which is an equivalent representation of the more commonly used Gaussian Schell-model cross-spectral density, may be defined in terms of its covariance matrix and centroid. Starting from the relationship between Gaussian Wigner functions and the Gaussian Schell model, we derive coherence properties of the Gaussian Wigner function, including coherence length and degree of coherence. We define a simplified beamline called a matrix-aperture beamline composed of linear transport sections separated by physical apertures. This is an idealized form for a transport beamline in a synchrotron light source or X-ray free electron laser. An envelope model provides a basic foundation for understanding the optics of a given beamline, in a manner analogous to how linear optics are treated in particle beam dynamics, with corresponding definitions of emittance and Twiss parameters. One major challenge to such an envelope model lies in the hard-edge apertures which break the Gaussian condition, raising the question as to the adequacy of a Gaussian model. We present a consistent way to construct a Gaussian approximation of the far-field Wigner function following the hard edge aperture. To this end, we introduce the concept of a Gaussian aperture and analyze its effects on the radiation Wigner function. A software implementation of this model is described as well.</description>

      <title>Photon Number-Resolving Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interacting two-level emitters in a moderately intense laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15193</link>

Abstract: We investigate the resonance fluorescence features of a small ensemble of closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the number of emitters from the sample. The 2N spectral sidebands, symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This way, one can estimate the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum. Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two sidebands spectral lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength, respectively.</description>

      <title>Lightwave-controlled relativistic plasma mirrors</title>

Abstract: We report on attosecond-scale control of high-harmonic and electron emission from plasma mirrors driven by relativistic-intensity near-single-cycle lightwaves at kHz repetition rate. By controlling the waveform of the intense light transient, we reproducibly form a sub-cycle temporal intensity gate at the plasma mirror surface, leading to the observation of extreme ultraviolet spectral continua, characteristic of isolated attosecond pulse generation. We also observe the correlated emission of a waveform-dependent relativistic electron beam, paving the way towards fully lightwave-controlled dynamics of relativistic plasma mirrors.</description>
