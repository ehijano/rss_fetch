      <title>Merges of Smooth Classes and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two Fra\"iss\'e-like classes with generic limits, we ask whether we can merge the two classes into one class with a generic limit. We study the properties of these merges and their generics, as well as their connections to structural Ramsey theory and the Hrushovski property (EPPA).</description>

      <title>On the Model Theory of Open Incidence Structures: The Rank 2 Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking inspiration from [1, 21, 24], we develop a general framework to deal with the model theory of open incidence structures. In this first paper we focus on the study of systems of points and lines (rank $2$). This has a number of applications, in particular we show that for any of the following classes all the non-degenerate free structures are elementarily equivalent, and their common theory is decidable, stricly stable, and with no prime model: $(k, n)$-Steiner systems (for $2 \leq k &lt; n$); generalised $n$-gons (for $n \geq 3$); $k$-nets (for $k \geq 3$); affine planes; projective M\"obius, Laguerre and Minkowski planes.</description>

      <title>Hereditary First-Order Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many computational problems can be modelled as the class of all finite relational structures $\mathbb A$ that satisfy a fixed first-order sentence $\phi$ hereditarily, i.e., we require that every substructure of $\mathbb A$ satisfies $\phi$. In this case, we say that the class is in HerFO. The problems in HerFO are always in coNP, and sometimes coNP-complete. HerFO also contains many interesting computational problems in P, including many constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We show that HerFO captures the class of complements of CSPs for reducts of finitely bounded structures, i.e., every such CSP is polynomial-time equivalent to the complement of a problem in HerFO. However, we also prove that HerFO does not have the full computational power of coNP: there are problems in coNP that are not polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in HerFO, unless E=NE. Another main result is a description of the quantifier-prefixes for $\phi$ such that hereditarily checking $\phi$ is in P; we show that for every other quantifier-prefix there exists a formula $\phi$ with this prefix such that hereditarily checking $\phi$ is coNP-complete.</description>

      <title>The algebraic semantics for the one-variable monadic fragment of the predicate logic $\mathcal{G}\forall_{\sim}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we characterize the equivalent algebraic semantics for the one-variable monadic fragment of the first-order logic ${\cal G} \forall_{\sim}$ defined by F. Esteva, L. Godo, P. H\'ajek and M. Navara in Residuated fuzzy logics with an involutive negation, Archive for Mathematical Logic 39 (2000). To this end, we first introduce the variety $\mathbb{MG}_{\sim}$ as a certain class of G\"odel algebras endowed with two monadic operators and a De Morgan negation. We study its basic properties, determine its subdirectly irreducible members and prove that this variety has the finite embeddabilty property. In particular, we prove that a special subvariety $\mathbb{CMG}_{\sim}$ of $\mathbb{MG}_\sim$ is exactly the desired equivalent algebraic semantics; this is done via a functional representation of finite subdirectly irreducible algebras.</description>

      <title>Set-Theoretic Hypodoxes and co-Russell's Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we argue that while the concept of a set-theoretic paradox (or paradoxical set) can be relatively well-defined in a formal setting, the concept of a set-theoretic hypodox (or hypodoxical set) remains unclear--particularly if the self-membership assertion of the co-Russell set, $\{x:x\in x\}$, is classified as hypodoxical, whereas other set-theoretic sentences with no evident connection to paradoxes are not. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a contradiction can be derived in Na\"{\i}ve Set Theory using the unique properties of the co-Russell set, relying on the Fixed Point Theorem of Na\"{\i}ve Set Theory.</description>

      <title>Large cardinals, structural reflection, and the HOD Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce exacting cardinals and a strengthening of these, ultraexacting cardinals. These are natural large cardinals defined equivalently as weak forms of rank-Berkeley cardinals, strong forms of J\'onsson cardinals, or in terms of principles of structural reflection. However, they challenge commonly held intuition on strong axioms of infinity. We prove that ultraexacting cardinals are consistent with Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) relative to the existence of an I0 embedding. However, the existence of an ultraexacting cardinal below a measurable cardinal implies the consistency of ZFC with a proper class of I0 embeddings, thus challenging the linear-incremental picture of the large cardinal hierarchy. We show that the existence of an exacting cardinal implies that V is not equal to HOD (G\"odel's universe of Hereditarily Ordinal Definable sets), showing that these cardinals surpass the current hierarchy of large cardinals consistent with ZFC. We prove that the consistency of ZFC with an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal refutes Woodin's HOD Conjecture and Ultimate-L Conjecture. Finally, we establish the consistency of ZFC with the existence of an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal from the consistency of ZF with certain large cardinals beyond choice.</description>

      <title>On Halin's end-degree Conjecture and $\omega$-strong cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new instances of \emph{Halin's end degree conjecture} within $\mathrm{ZFC}$. In particular, we prove that there is a proper class of cardinals $\kappa$ for which Haliln's end-degree conjecture holds. This answers two questions posed by Geschke, Kurkofka, Melcher and Pitz in 2023. Furthermore, we comment on the relationship between Halin's conjecture and the \emph{Singular Cardinal Hypothesis}, deriving consistency strength from failures of the former. We also show that Halin's conjecture fails on finite intervals of successors of singular cardinals in Meremovich's model.</description>

      <title>The Lambda Calculus is Quantifiable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce several quantitative methods for the lambda-calculus based on partial metrics, a well-studied variant of standard metric spaces that have been used to metrize non-Hausdorff topologies, like those arising from Scott domains. First, we study quantitative variants, based on program distances, of sensible equational theories for the $\lambda$-calculus, like those arising from B\"ohm trees and from the contextual preorder. Then, we introduce applicative distances capturing higher-order Scott topologies, including reflexive objects like the $D_\infty$ model. Finally, we provide a quantitative insight on the well-known connection between the B\"ohm tree of a $\lambda$-term and its Taylor expansion, by showing that the latter can be presented as an isometric transformation.</description>

      <title>Relation algebras containing Thompson groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connections between Tarski's relation algebras and Thompson's groups F, T, V, and his monoid M are reviewed here, along with Jonsson-Tarski algebras, fork algebras, true pairing algebras, and tabular relation algebras. All of these algebras are related to the finitization problem and to Tarski's formalization of set theory without variables.
  Most of the technical details occur in the variety of J-algebras, which is obtained from relation algebras by omitting union and complementation and adopting a set of axioms created by Jonsson. Every relation algebra or J-algebra that contains a pair of conjugated quasiprojections satisfying the Domain and Unicity conditions, such as those that arise from Jonsson-Tarski algebras or fork algebras, will also contain homomorphic images of F, T, V, and M.
  The representability of tabular relation algebras is extended here to J-algebras, using a notion of tabularity that is equivalent among relation algebras to the original definition.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Nonsense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the early Wittgenstein's concept of nonsense (meaning that which lies beyond the limits of language), we investigate two different types of nonsense: formal nonsense and pragmatic nonsense. The simpler notion of formal nonsense is defined in accordance with Tarski's semantic theory of truth; the notion of pragmatic nonsense is in turn formulated within the context of the theory of pragmatic truth, also known as quasi-truth, as formalized by da Costa and his collaborators. Pragmatic nonsense extends formal nonsense, the same way da Costa's pragmatic truth is an extension of Tarski's definition of truth. An expression is thus considered formally nonsensical in case the formal criteria required for the assignment of any truth-value (whether true, false, pragmatically true, or pragmatically false) are not met; and an expression, or even a well-formed formula, is considered pragmatically nonsensical if either the formal or the pragmatic criteria of relevance (inscribed within the context of scientific practice) required for the assignment of any pragmatic truth-value (pragmatically true or pragmatically false) are not met. We also introduce the concept of strictly pragmatic truth, which excludes pragmatic nonsense and necessarily depends on certain criteria of relevance, unlike the original definition of pragmatic truth/quasi-truth.</description>

      <title>Generic Absoluteness Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15384v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the relation between recurrence axioms and Laver-generic large cardinal axioms in light of principles of generic absoluteness and the Ground Axiom.
  M. Viale proved that Martin's Maximum$^{++}$ together with the assumption that there are class many Woodin cardinals implies $\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}}\prec_{\Sigma_2}\mathcal{H}(\aleph_2)^{\mathsf{V}[\mathbb{G}]}$ for a generic $\mathbb{G}$ on any stationary preserving $\mathbb{P}$ which also preserves Bounded Martin's Maximum. We show that a similar but more general conclusion follows from each of $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_{\Sigma_2}$-${\sf RcA}^+$ (which is a fragment of a reformulation of the Maximality Principle for $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{H}(\kappa)$), and the existence of the tightly $\mathcal{P}$-Laver-generically huge cardinal.
  While under "$\mathcal{P}=$ all stationary preserving posets", our results are not very much more than Viale's Theorem, for other classes of posets, "$\mathcal{P}=$ all proper posets" or "$\mathcal{P}=$ all ccc posets", for example, our theorems are not at all covered by his theorem.
  The assumptions (and hence also the conclusion) of Viale's Theorem are compatible with the Ground Axiom. In contrast, we show that the assumptions of our theorems (for most of the common settings of $\mathcal{P}$ and with a modification of the large cardinal property involved) imply the negation of the Ground Axiom. This fact is used to show that fragments of Recurrence Axiom $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$-${\sf RcA}^+$ can be different from the corresponding fragments of Maximality Principle ${\sf MP}(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{H}(\kappa))_\Gamma$ for $\Gamma=\Pi_2$.</description>

Abstract: The shuffle of a non-empty countable set $ S $ of linear orders is the (unique up to isomorphism) linear order $ \Xi(S) $ obtained by fixing a coloring function $ \chi: \mathbb{Q} \to S $ having fibers dense in $ \mathbb{Q} $ and replacing each rational $ q $ in $ (\mathbb{Q}, &lt;) $ with an isomorphic copy of $ \chi(q) $. We prove that any two countable shuffles that embed as convex subsets into each other are order isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore various semantic understandings of dual intuitionistic logic by exploring the relationship between co-Heyting algebras and topological spaces. First, we discuss the relevant ideas in the setting of Heyting algebras and intuitionistic logic, showing organically the progression from the primordial example of lattices of open sets of topological spaces to more general ways of thinking about Heyting algebras. Then, we adapt the ideas to the dual intuitionistic setting, and use them to prove a number of interesting properties, including a deep relationship both intuitionistic and dual intuitionistic logic share through Kripke semantics to the modal logic $\mathsf{S4}$.</description>

Abstract: A group is Artinian if there is no infinite strictly descending chain of subgroups. Ol'shanskii has asked whether there are Artinian groups of arbitrarily large cardinality. We show that this problem is essentially the same as an analogous question, regarding universal algebras, asked by J\'onsson in the 1960s. We further show that these problems are the same as the so-called free subset problem. As a result, one can have a consistent strong negative answer (from a large cardinal assumption) as well as a consistent positive answer.</description>

      <title>Topoi of automata I: Four topoi of automata and regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both topos theory and automata theory are known for their multi-faceted nature and relationship with topology, algebra, logic, and category theory. This paper aims to clarify the topos-theoretic aspects of automata theory, particularly demonstrating through two main theorems how regular (and non-regular) languages arise in topos-theoretic calculation. First, it is shown that the four different notions of automata form four types of Grothendieck topoi, illustrating how the technical details of automata theory are described by topos theory. Second, we observe that the four characterizations of regular languages (DFA, Myhill-Nerode theorem, finite monoids, profinite words) provide Morita-equivalent definitions of a single Boolean-ringed topos, situating this within the context of Olivia Caramello's 'Toposes as Bridges.'
  This paper also serves as a preparation for follow-up papers, which deal with the relationship between hyperconnected geometric morphisms and algebraic/geometric aspects of formal language theory.</description>
