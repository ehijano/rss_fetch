      <title>Cumulants of the multiplicity distributions of identified particles measured in heavy-ion collisions by HADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HADES experiment investigates the reaction products of heavy-ion collisions at a few GeV, providing access to QCD matter at high net-baryon densities. A particular focus is the reconstruction of higher-order cumulant ratios of proton and light nuclei multiplicity distributions, which are considered sensitive probes of criticality through their connection to event-by-event (E-by-E) net-baryon number fluctuations. In this contribution, we summarize the experimental setup and outline the analysis strategy. The fluctuations are reconstructed using a novel approach that circumvents E-by-E particle identification by treating it probabilistically. We present several approaches for efficiency correction and apply a data-driven event-mixing procedure to correct for centrality fluctuations. The fully corrected normalized factorial cumulants of proton and deuteron multiplicity distributions are then presented and compared to corresponding STAR data. Our measurements extend the trends observed by STAR toward lower energies for the ratios $C_2/C_1$ and $C_3/C_1$. Finally, we show the rapidity dependence of factorial cumulant ratios and confront the results with canonical ensemble baselines that incorporate correlated particle production via local attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy can tell whether $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$ are resonances or virtual states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$, particularly whether they are near-threshold resonances, virtual states, or bound states. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be employed to distinguish between these three scenarios. More concretely, based on the Koonin-Pratt formula with a Gaussian source, we show that the low-momentum $D^0D^{*-}$/$D^0D_s^{*-}$ correlation functions significantly differ in the three scenarios. The high-momentum results exhibit distinct characteristics in the resonant and virtual state scenarios, especially in small collision systems of 1 fm, as produced in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. We hope that these discoveries will stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states that have been discovered.</description>

      <title>Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitarity deficit reduction via finite nuclear size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. The decay rate dependence on the $^{26m}$Al charge radius is found to be four times higher than previously believed, necessitating precise determination. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|$.</description>

      <title>Unwinding the rare $\Omega$ sector: Fragmentation of fully charmed baryons from HL-LHC to FCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By adopting a hadron-structure-oriented approach, we present and discuss the release of the novel OMG3Q1.0 set of collinear fragmentation functions for fully charmed, rare $\Omega$ baryons. Our methodology combines diquark-like proxy model inputs for both charm-quark and gluon channels, calculated at the initial energy scales, with a DGLAP evolution that ensures a consistent treatment of heavy-quark thresholds, following directly from the HF-NRevo scheme. We complement our work with a phenomenological study of NLL/NLO$^+$ resummed $\Omega_{3c}$ plus jet distributions using (sym)JETHAD at the HL-LHC and the future FCC. Unraveling the production mechanisms of rare, yet-unobserved hadrons, as provided by the OMG3Q1.0 functions, stands as a key asset for deepening our understanding of QCD at future high-energy hadron colliders.</description>
