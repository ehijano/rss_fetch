      <title>Infrared foundations for quantum geometry I: Catalogue of totally symmetric rank-three field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically obtain all linear models which propagate a totally symmetric rank-three field without parity violation on a flat background. Each such model is defined exclusively by its gauge symmetry, a necessary property of effective field theories in the infrared limit. By comparison, models obtained by other means (tuning couplings or cherry-picking operators) may be unstable against radiative corrections. For each model, we compute the spectrum of massless and massive particles, and the no-ghost-no-tachyon constraints on the couplings. We conclude that foundational models exist which can propagate one massless particle of spin one or spin three in isolation, or both particles simultaneously, generalising the model of Campoleoni and Francia. Our algorithm for detecting symmetric models is grounded in particle physics methods, being based directly on the Wigner decomposition of the field. Compared to our recent analysis of the totally symmetric rank-three field (whose results we confirm and extend) our new algorithm does not require an ansatz for the symmetry transformation, and is not restricted to so-called 'free' symmetries.</description>

      <title>String Duals of Two-Dimensional Yang-Mills and Symmetric Product Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a bosonic string dual to large $N$ chiral Yang-Mills in two dimensions at finite 't Hooft coupling. The worldsheet theory is a $\beta$-$\gamma$ system deformed by a chiral Polchinski-Strominger term. We reproduce the partition function on a torus, cylinder three-point amplitudes, and the area law for Wilson loops. We also present candidate string duals to symmetric product orbifolds for general seed CFTs with $c&lt;24$ and their $T\bar{T}$-, $J\bar{T}$-deformations. The results hint at interrelations among confining, nonrelativistic and matrix strings, and AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Heavy-Light Asymptotics from Thermal Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of spectral densities and heavy-heavy-light (HHL) operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients in three-dimensional conformal field theories using thermal one-point functions on $S^1 \times S^2$. A central element of our analysis is a new inversion formula for one-point functions which is derived via Casimir differential equations. We develop systematic expansions of the spectral density and HHL OPE coefficients in the regime of large $\Delta_H$. We validate our analytic tools by comparing the results with the partial wave expansions of thermal one-point functions in free field theories. The algorithms developed for these expansions make full use of Casimir recursion relations, thereby extending their applicability into the heavy exchange regime. In the end, we observe excellent agreement with our analytic predictions and an improvement of up to three orders of magnitude compared to all previous leading order estimates of the CFT data even for moderate values of $\Delta_H$.</description>

      <title>Higher-curvature corrections and near horizon symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near-horizon region, black holes exhibit an infinite-dimensional symmetry reminiscent of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) supertranslations. The conserved charges associated with this symmetry can be computed in gravitational theories of arbitrary spacetime dimension and involving curvature terms of any order. In Lovelock theory, for instance, these charges take the form of nested Lagrangian densities corresponding to topological invariants, each weighted by the supertranslation function -- thus providing a natural generalization of the Wald entropy formula. In four dimensions, the computation of the supertranslation charge reduces to the evaluation of the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) action on the two-dimensional spacelike sections of the event horizon.</description>

      <title>New Exceptional EFTs in de Sitter Space from Generalised Energy Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a surprising relationship between exceptional effective field theories (EFTs) in de Sitter space and a notion of \textit{generalised energy conservation} (GEC) of an S-matrix defined in an extended Poincar\'{e} patch of four-dimensional de Sitter. By demanding that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal, we constrain the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars living in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations. We rediscover the theories of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon, and when increasing the conformal dimension we find evidence for new exceptional theories where the four-point scalar self interactions are uniquely fixed in terms of a single coupling constant. We conjecture that for each integer conformal dimension $\Delta \geq 4$, there is at least one exceptional EFT that can be entirely fixed by GEC.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents, phase transition and chaos bound in Kerr-Newman AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents associated with chaotic motions of both massless and massive particles in the vicinity of a Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. Our exploration focuses on their correlations with the black hole phase transition and the chaos bound. The results demonstrate that these exponents serve as effective probes of the phase transition, with the chaotic Lyapunov exponent of the massless particle offering a more precise characterization. Further calculations indicate that critical exponents linked to these Lyapunov exponents are uniformly 1/2. Notably, the violation of the chaos bound occurs irrespective of whether a phase transition is taking place. Through comparative analysis, we identify a critical radius, and the violation consistently arises when the black hole's radius is less than this critical radius. Moreover, this violation is observed in the spacetime of the stable small black hole during the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Flat 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Black Hole with R\'enyi Entropy: An RPST-like formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) gravity using R\'enyi entropy as a non-extensive generalization of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The resulting thermodynamic structure, formulated within a restricted phase space-like (RPST-like) framework, reveals a striking resemblance to the thermodynamics of AdS black holes in the standard RPST formalism. In particular, we identify a thermodynamic duality between the R\'enyi deformation parameter $\beta$ and a conjugate response potential $\zeta$, analogous to the central charge and chemical potential in holographic theories. An extensive thermodynamic analysis in both fixed charge-$(\tilde{Q})$ and fixed potential-$(\tilde{\Phi})$ ensembles reveal Van der Waals-like first-order phase transitions which is an unexpected feature for asymptotically flat black holes. Furthermore, through the formalism of geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that the thermodynamic geometry of the R\'enyi-modified flat black hole mimics that of the AdS black hole under RPST, reinforcing the structural similarity between these seemingly different systems. Our findings point to a deeper correspondence between non-extensive entropy and holographic thermodynamics, suggesting that R\'enyi entropy may serve as a natural bridge between flat-space black hole thermodynamics and AdS holography.</description>

      <title>Holographic Fractional Order Phase Transitions in CFTs Dual to AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the CFT phase transitions of various AdS black hole solutions, including the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS (RN-AdS) black hole, the ModMax-AdS black hole, and the RN-AdS black hole formulated within the framework of Kaniadakis statistics, through the lens of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Employing the generalized Ehrenfest classification scheme based on fractional-order derivatives, we analyze the nature of phase transitions at both Davies points and critical points. Davies points, defined as the loci of divergent heat capacity, are typically associated with second-order transitions in the classical Ehrenfest paradigm. However, a refined analysis reveals that these points can be categorized into two distinct types: the first corresponds to extrema in the temperature profile, while the second aligns with its inflection point, i.e., the thermodynamic critical point. Our findings demonstrate that the order of the phase transition is sensitive to this classification, with the first type corresponding to a fractional order of $3/2$, and the second to $4/3$, which is consistent across RN-AdS black holes. Notably, when a specific constraint is imposed, we observe a $3/2$-order phase transition for both the RN-AdS and ModMax-AdS black holes, whereas in the case of the RN-AdS black hole with Kaniadakis statistics, two critical points arise under constrained paths, each exhibiting a transition of order $4/3$. This generalized, fractional-order framework enables a more precise and discriminating characterization of CFT phase transitions in holographic settings, revealing distinctions that remain hidden under traditional classifications. The results provide deeper insight into the rich structure of black hole thermodynamics on the CFT side and highlight the significance of fractional calculus as a powerful tool for probing critical phenomena within the AdS/CFT framework.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of states in orbifolds of products of $N=2$ Superconformal ADE Minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit construction of fields in orbifolds of products of $N=(2,2)$ minimal models, developed by A.Belavin, V.Belavin and S.Parkhomenko to include minimal models with D and E-type modular invariants. It is shown that spectral flow twisting by the elements of admissible group $G_{\text{adm}}$, which is used in the construction of the orbifold, is consistent with the nondiagonal pairing of D and E-type minimal models. We obtain the complete set of fields of the orbifold from the mutual locality and other requirements of the conformal bootstrap. The collection of mutually local primary fields is labeled by the elements of mirror group $G^{*}_{\text{adm}}$. The permutation of $G_{\text{adm}}$ and $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ is given by the mirror spectral flow construction of the fields and transforms the original orbifold into a mirror one. This transformation is by construction an isomorphism of $N=(2,2)$ models. We illustrate our construction for the orbifolds of $\textbf{A}_{2}\textbf{E}_7^{3}$ model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter serves as the generalization of the work 2505.16436, where we investigated the quantum field theory in Klein space which has two time directions. We extend studies to the general spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{n,d-n}\,(n,d-n\geq2)$ in a similar manner: the ``length of time'' $q$ is regarded as the evolution direction of the system; additional modes beyond the plane wave modes are introduced in the canonical quantization. We show that this novel formulation is consistent with the analytical continuation of the results in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) construction when the objects of interest are the In-In (or real time) correlators rather than the In-Out S-matrix elements is constructed. This is done using the formal equivalence between the In-In and In-Out correlation functions, and demanding that the EFT and the full theory provide the same answers for the In-In correlation functions. Matching coefficients for a simple example are provided including for operators with two or more space or time derivatives. It is also pointed out that the Schrodinger representation of QFT captures some of the desired features of these calculations in a natural way and may actually serve as a link between these calculations and the broader amplitude programme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for modeling topological phases of matter using code-based Narain conformal field theories (NCFTs). We show that the algebraic structure of the NCFTs naturally embeds into critical lattice quantum field theory, yielding emergent topological features characteristic of gapless fermionic systems with non-zero Chern numbers. We develop a new representation of construction A of code CFT in terms of root and weight lattices of Lie algebras, focusing in particular on SU(2) and SU(3). We then derive the spectrum of particle states occupying the lattice and, with the help of fermionisation techniques, demonstrate that it hosts fermionic excitations with Dirac cones akin to tight binding systems namely the Haldane model of quantum anomalous hall effect on a honeycomb geometry.</description>

      <title>Exact BPS black hole microstate counting from holographic conformal quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we develop a prescription for describing BPS black hole microstates in terms of a holographic conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) model dual to the near-horizon $AdS_2$ geometry of the black hole. We use 1/2 BPS small black holes in a 4D ${\cal N}=4$ toroidal heterotic compactification as well as 1/8 BPS large black holes in a 4D ${\cal N}=8$ Type II toroidal compactification as test cases for our approach. In each case, the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular symmetries of the known generating function of the exact microstate degeneracies enables the latter to be expressed as a Rademacher series expansion, with each summand consisting of phases and a modified Bessel function of the first kind. We make a motivated ansatz that the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model (DFF) coupled to a simple harmonic oscillator is a universal sector of the holographic CQM dual to the BPS black hole's near-horizon $AdS_2$ geometry, and demonstrate how in both cases, the two parameters of this putative CQM, the DFF coupling as well as the oscillator frequency, exactly encode both the index and the argument of the Bessel function. Consequently, we extract the leading, logarithmic and all sub-leading power law black hole entropy contributions from calculations in the CQM. In the ${\cal N}=4$ case, the DFF ansatz is sufficient to successfully reproduce the exact microscopic generating function from the CQM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum theory of asymptotically flat space-times is presented using the solutions of the Null Surface Formulation (NSF) field equations in a perturbative scheme. Free-field commutation relations are given for the null free data of NSF at future or past null infinity, and the main variables of NSF are then used to define the interior points of the space-time as labels and the metric of the space-time as a derived quantum operator. A non-trivial scattering of gravitons is given.</description>

      <title>On the string theory of a single NS5-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a worldsheet description of string theory in the background of a single decoupled NS5-brane, which is a particularly simple example of ``little string'' holography. The worldsheet theory involves a gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model for the group coset $\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{H}$, where $\mathcal{G} = {PSU(1,1|2)} \times \mathbb R^{5,1}$ and $\mathcal{H}=U(1) \times U(1)$. A variant of the embedding of $\mathcal{H}$ into $\mathcal{G}$ describes a background that interpolates between the fivebrane throat in the UV and $AdS_3$ in the IR, which is dual to the (single trace) $T\bar T$-deformed symmetric product orbifold $(\mathbb T^4)^N/S_N$. Well-known difficulties with a worldsheet theory for $n_5=1$ fivebranes are bypassed by the incorporation of an extra constraint on the dynamics. This constraint arises naturally from consideration of the effects of deforming the theory by one of the four Ramond-Ramond moduli of the spacetime background, which for $n_5=1$ imposes the constraint that our analysis has identified. Along the way, we construct a map between the supergroup formulation of the $n_5=1$ worldsheet theory and the more conventional RNS worldsheet formalism.</description>

Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quasinormal mode excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) through the plunge, merger and ringdown of an extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral into a Schwarzschild black hole, for generic orbital configurations. We work out the QNM causality condition, crucial to eliminate amplitude divergences and to incorporate horizon redshift effects. We then use it to derive a model of the time-dependent QNM excitation via a Green's function approach, driven by the point-particle source on a given trajectory. Our model predicts that: i) QNMs propagates along hyperboloidal slices in the minimal gauge; ii) the signal is composed of an ``activation'' term, depending on the source past history, and a local ``impulsive'' term; iii) amplitudes grow in time in an ``activation function'' fashion, and the waveform displays a stationary ringdown regime at times $\sim 10-20M$ after its peak; iv) at these late times, an infinite tower of non-oscillatory, exponentially-damped terms appear: the redshift modes. The model is in good agreement with numerical solutions, capturing the main waveform features after the peak. Additional components of the Green's function are required to complement the QNM description and reproduce the plunge-merger waveform. We predict the late-time, stationary amplitude of the quadrupolar mode as a function of eccentricity, in agreement with accurate numerical solutions, marking the first time that QNM amplitudes are predicted for generic binary configurations. Our work provides a first solid step towards analytically modeling the inspiral's imprint onto ringdown signals, generalizable to include higher orders in the mass ratio, black hole spin, non-vacuum configurations and corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>Natural neutrino mass hierarchy in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a natural neutrino mass hierarchy with large lepton mixing angles may be achieved in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction. Hitherto it has been shown that neutrino anarchy may result from such theories, but here we show that this need not necessarily be the case. In particular we consider the minimal tri-hypercharge theory, and show that the decomposition of the family hypercharges into the corresponding $B-L$ gauge groups, together with the charged lepton mass hierarchy, implies the sequential dominance conditions for a neutrino mass hierarchy, where lepton mixing originates from both the neutrino and charged lepton sectors. We present novel and model-independent sequential dominance results applicable to this case, but also useful more generally. We also show how natural quark mass and mixing are included in such a framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of the interacting system of relativistic particles and antiparticles in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate was investigated within the framework of the mean-field model. It is assumed that the total isospin (charge) density is conserved. We show that, depending on the strength of the interaction, a bosonic particle-antiparticle system exhibits four types of phase transitions to the condensate phase. Three types correspond to the second-order phase transition, while one is a first-order phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare different constructions of mirrors of del Pezzo surfaces, focusing on degree $d \leq 3$. In particular, we extract Lefschetz fibrations, with associated exceptional collections, from the mirrors obtained via the Hori-Vafa and Fanosearch program constructions, which we relate to one another. We show with geometric methods that the Lefschetz fibrations define categorical mirrors. With a more explicit approach, we give a sequence of (numerical) mutations relating the exceptional collections considered by Auroux, Katzarkov, and Orlov with those arising in this paper. This uses the theory of surface-like pseudolattices, and extends some of the string junction results of Grassi, Halverson and Shaneson. Our argument lifts directly to an equivalence of certain Fukaya-Seidel categories arising from our fibrations and those of Auroux, Katzarkov, and Orlov.</description>

      <title>The nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Towards a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states are both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>

      <title>Collins function for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions: a test of universality and factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the Collins azimuthal asymmetries for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions. To this aim, we employ a recent extraction of the transversity and Collins fragmentation functions from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadron pairs processes, obtained within a simplified transverse momentum dependent (TMD) approach at leading order and adopting a collinear configuration for the initial state. Our theoretical estimates, when compared against 200 GeV and 510 GeV (preliminary) data from the STAR Collaboration, show a generally good agreement for the $p_{{\rm j}T}$ (the transverse momentum of the jet), $z$ and $j_T$ (the pion longitudinal momentum fraction and its transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction) distributions. This corroborates the hypothesis of the universality of the Collins function as well as of the TMD factorization for such processes and, once again, of a reduced impact of the proper TMD evolution on azimuthal asymmetries. We will also present predictions based on an extraction of the Collins and transversity distributions where information from data on single spin asymmetry for inclusive pion production in $p^\uparrow p$ collisions is included through a Bayesian reweighting procedure.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects in an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universality of electric charge as a quantum number allows thermoelectric properties to manifest across diverse systems, starting from a hot quantum chromodynamics matter in heavy-ion collisions at a high energy scale to semiconductors in condensed matter systems at a low energy scale. In this work, we explore the emergence of magneto-transport phenomena, specifically the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects, in a hot and dense hadronic medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies. These phenomena arise due to the combined influence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential, particularly in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic medium considering different frameworks of hadron resonance gas models. The presence of external magnetic fields breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric transport coefficient matrix, giving rise to new components of the Thomson coefficient, namely, magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. For the first time, we estimate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients, which originate from the temperature dependence of the magneto-Seebeck coefficient and Nernst coefficient, respectively, in hadron gas under the influence of a magnetic field. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the higher-order thermoelectric properties of the hot and dense hadronic medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Coincident GR in Internal STEGR Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Coincident General Relativity (CGR) in the gauge approach to gravity based on Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the {\it internal-space formulation}, which one of the authors recently proposed in Ref.~[J. Math. Phys. 66 (2025) 5, 052505]. First, we review the standard formulation of STEGR theories in the Palatini approach to gravity, in which formulation we impose the teleparallel and torsion-free conditions by using Lagrange multipliers. Second, we introduce the STEGR theories in the gauge approach to gravity, which is formulated in the internal space, and derive its field equations. We briefly discuss whether the Ostrogradski ghost instability exists and find that the theory may require a degenerate condition to be imposed. Finally, assuming the coincident gauge, we derive CGR in both terms of the action integral and the field equation. Discussing the possible kinematics of the STEGR theory, we formulate a motion of a test scalar particle in the spacetime with non-metricity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a toric localization formula in the cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. Consider a (-1)-shifted symplectic algebraic space with a $\mathbb{G}_m$-action leaving the (-1)-shifted symplectic form invariant (typical examples are the moduli space of stable sheaves or complexes of sheaves on a Calabi-Yau threefold with a $\mathbb{G}_m$-invariant Calabi-Yau form or the intersection of two $\mathbb{G}_m$-invariant Lagrangians in a symplectic space with a $\mathbb{G}_m$-invariant symplectic form). In this case we express the restriction of the Donaldson-Thomas perverse sheaf (or monodromic mixed Hodge module) defined by Joyce et al. to the attracting variety as a sum of cohomological shifts of the DT perverse sheaves on the $\mathbb{G}_m$-fixed components. This result can be seen as a (-1)-shifted version of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition for smooth schemes. We obtain our result from a similar formula for stacks and Halpern-Leistner's Theta-correspondence, at the level of perverse Nori motives, which we use also to derive foundational constructions in DT theory, in particular the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall crossing formula and the construction of the Cohomological Hall Algebra for smooth projective Calabi-Yau threefolds (a similar construction of the CoHA was also done independently by Kinjo, Park, and Safronov in a recent work). This paper subsumes the previous paper "Hyperbolic localization of the Donaldson-Thomas sheaf" from the same author.</description>

Abstract: In four spacetime dimensions, the classically integrable self-dual sectors of gauge theory and gravity have associated chiral algebras, which emerge naturally from their description in twistor space. We show that there are similar chiral algebras associated to integrable sectors of gauge theory and gravity whenever the spacetime dimension is an integer multiple of four. In particular, the hyperk\"ahler sector of gravity and the hyperholomorphic sector of gauge theory in $4m$-dimensions have well-known twistor descriptions giving rise to chiral algebras. Using twistor sigma models to describe these sectors, we demonstrate that the chiral algebras in higher-dimensions also arise as soft symmetry algebras under a certain notion of collinear limit. Interestingly, the chiral algebras and collinear limits in higher-dimensions are defined on the 2-sphere, rather than the full celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Demystifying integrable QFTs in AdS: No-go theorems for higher-spin charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-spin conserved currents and charges feature prominently in integrable 2d QFTs in flat space. Motivated by the question of integrable field theories in AdS space, we consider the consequences of higher-spin currents for QFTs in AdS$_2$, and find that their effect is much more constraining than in flat space. Specifically, it is impossible to preserve: (a) any higher-spin charges when deforming a massive free field by interactions (even boundary-localized), or (b) any spin-4 charges when deforming a CFT by a Virasoro primary. Therefore, in these settings, there are no integrable theories in AdS with higher-spin conserved charges. Along the way, we explain how higher-spin charges lead to integer spacing in the spectrum of primaries, sum rules on the OPE data, and constraints on correlation functions. We also explain a key difference between AdS and flat space: in AdS one cannot `partially' conserve a higher-spin current along particular directions, since the AdS isometries imply full conservation. Finally, we describe the consequences of higher-spin symmetry breaking on the spectrum of long-range models.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (ArXiv version) We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model with homogeneously smeared D(-1)-branes. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic fluxes produced by the $N_{c}$ open strings on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the baryonic fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large $N_{c}$ field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quantum tunneling process through a topology transition near a conifold singularity, in the setup of IIB CY3 orientifold compactification. We propose a novel method to do moduli stabilization in an extended moduli space, parametrized by both the geometric moduli and the light D3-brane wrapping modes arisen from the brane quantization. Assuming the absence of flux through the vanishing exceptional 3-cycle, we find two types of vacuum solutions, one corresponds to the resolved conifold and the other one is interpreted as a novel non-geometric phase. We compute the quantum tunneling rate between these two solutions and find that it is difficult to achieve a significantly large tunneling rate in the controllable regime.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>

      <title>Improved entanglement entropy estimates from filtered bitstring probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the bitstring probabilities of ground states of bipartitioned ladders of Rydberg atoms, we calculate the mutual information which is a lower bound on the corresponding bipartite von Neumann quantum entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. We show that in many cases, these lower bounds can be improved by removing the bitstrings with a probability lower than some value $p_{min}$ and renormalizing the remaining probabilities (filtering). We propose a heuristic based on the change of the conditional entropy under filtering that very effectively improves the estimate of $S^{vN}_A$. We consider various sizes, lattice spacings and bipartitions. Our numerical investigation suggest that the filtered mutual information obtained with samples having just a few thousand bitstrings can provide reasonably close estimates of $S^{vN}_A$. We briefly discuss practical implementations with the QuEra's Aquila device.</description>

      <title>Classifying Logical Gates in Quantum Codes via Cohomology Operations and Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically construct and classify fault-tolerant logical gates implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum codes using cohomology operations and symmetry. These logical gates are obtained from unitary operators given by symmetry-protected topological responses, which correspond to generators of group cohomology and can be expressed explicitly on the lattice using cohomology operations including cup product, Steenrod squares and new combinations of higher cup products called higher Pontryagin powers. Our study covers most types of the cohomology operations in the literature. This hence gives rise to logical $C^{n-1}Z$ gates in $n$ copies of quantum codes via the $n$-fold cup product in the usual color code paradigm, as well as several new classes of diagonal and non-diagonal logical gates in increasing Clifford hierarchies beyond the color code paradigm, including the logical $R_k$ and multi-controlled $C^m R_k$ gates for codes defined in projective spaces. Implementing these gates could make it more efficient to compile specific types of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm. We further extend the construction to quantum codes with boundaries, which generalizes the folding approach in color codes. We also present a formalism for addressable and parallelizable logical gates in LDPC codes via higher-form symmetries. We further construct logical Clifford gates in expander-based codes including the asymptotically good LDPC codes and hypergraph-product codes. As a byproduct, we find new topological responses of finite higher-form symmetries using higher Pontryagin powers.</description>

      <title>Gluon mass scale through the Schwinger mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been argued that the action of the Schwinger mechanism in the gauge sector of Quantum Chromodynamics leads to the generation of a gluon mass scale. Within this scenario, the analytic structure of the fundamental vertices is modified by the creation of scalar colored excitations with vanishing mass. In the limit of zero momentum transfer, these terms act as massless poles, providing the required conditions for the infrared stabilization of the gluon propagator, and producing a characteristic displacement to the associated Ward identities. In this article we offer an extensive overview of the salient notions and techniques underlying this dynamical picture. We place particular emphasis on recent developments related to the exact renormalization of the mass, the nonlinear nature of the pole equation, and the key role played by the Fredholm alternative theorem.</description>

      <title>Information Dynamics in Quantum Harmonic Systems: Insights from Toy Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores quantum information dynamics using a toy model of coupled harmonic oscillators, focusing on the interplay between mutual information, synchronization, and circuit complexity. We examine how variations in coupling strength, detuning and external factors, such as a magnetic field, influence information flow and computational metrics. Through exact Gaussian methods we determine the circuit depth for generating target states, examine time-dependent effects, and show that increased fidelity corresponds to more regular behavior. In the context of ion transport, we compare sudden and adiabatic protocols, quantifying their fidelity-complexity through a nonadiabaticity metric. This analysis demonstrates the superior performance of smooth control sequences in minimizing operational errors. We also establish synchronization and mutual information as complementary but distinct measures of quantum correlations, with particularly divergent behavior in nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Non-Locality in Particle Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality, providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations. Our findings provide deeper insights into the boundaries of classical and quantum theories in three-particle systems, advancing the understanding of non-locality in particle decays and its relevance to particle physics and quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Two simple photon gauges in inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon propagators for power-law inflation are constructed in two one-parameter families of noncovariant gauges, in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. In both gauges photon propagators take relatively simple forms expressed in terms of scalar propagators and their derivatives. These are considerably simpler compared to their general covariant gauge counterpart. This makes feasible performing dimensionally regulated loop computations involving massless vector fields in inflation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's equivalence principle suggests a deep connection between matter and spacetime, prompting the question: if matter violates parity, must gravity? This letter explores the detection of parity violation in gravity using gravitational wave (GW) memory. Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. With improved sensitivity, next-generation GW detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to probe these effects. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs, amplified over cosmological distances, can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. Specifically, if GWs from astrophysical events have differing polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity, ICM significantly amplifies this disparity. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity.</description>

      <title>Thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation with real photon emission/absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark matter relic density is being increasingly precisely measured. This relic density is theoretically determined by a Boltzmann equation which computes the dark matter distribution according to the (thermally averaged) cross section for annihilation/production of dark matter within a given model. We present here the complete higher order thermal corrections, calculated using real time thermal field theory, to the cross section for the annihilation of dark matter into Standard Model fermions via charged scalars: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$ and $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f} (\gamma)$. The latter process includes real photon emission into, and absorption from, the heat bath at temperature $T$. We use the Grammer and Yennie technique to separate the soft infra-red divergences, which greatly simplifies the calculation. We show explicitly the cancellation of both soft and collinear divergences between real and virtual contributions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the thermal field theory and remark on the non-trivial nature of the collinear divergences when the thermal contribution from fermions is considered. We present the leading thermal contributions to order ${\cal{O}}(\alpha T^2)$ for the case when the dark matter particle is a Majorana or Dirac type fermion. In the former case, both the leading order (LO) and NLO cross sections are helicity suppressed, while neither is suppressed in the Dirac case. It is interesting that the ratio of NLO to LO cross sections is the same for both Majorana and Dirac type dark matter.</description>
