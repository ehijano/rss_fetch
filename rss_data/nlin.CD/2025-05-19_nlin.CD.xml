      <title>Manifold dynamics and orbital properties in a two-dimensional galactic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the orbital dynamics of a two-dimensional galactic model, emphasizing the influence of stable and unstable manifolds on the evolution of orbits. In our analysis we use evaluations of the system's Lagrangian descriptors to reveal the structure and location of manifolds. In addition, we perform extensive computations of the forward and backward in time evolution of ensembles of orbits, which allow us to study the future and past dynamics of the model by constructing its so-called origin-fate maps. Focusing on the properties of the escape of orbits from the central regions of the model's configuration space, we analyze various aspects of the orbits' evolutions, like the time an orbit needs to escape from the central region, the total time it spends at the exterior areas of the galaxy, as well as the number of its escapes and reentries from and to the central region. Furthermore, we follow the past and future evolution of orbits keeping track of the regions from which they leave the central parts of the galaxy, and relate different orbital behaviors with the enhancement of specific morphological features in the system's configuration space. Our results indicate that the stable (unstable) manifolds mainly influence the orbital characteristics of the model in the future (past).</description>

      <title>Fractal geometry predicts dynamic differences in structural and functional connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate architecture of brain networks and its connection to brain function is essential for deciphering the underlying principles of cognition and disease.
  While traditional graph-theoretical measures have been widely used to characterize these networks, they often fail to fully capture the emergent properties of large-scale neural dynamics. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to quantify brain networks that is rooted in complex dynamics, fractal geometry, and asymptotic analysis.
  We apply these concepts to brain connectomes and demonstrate how quadratic iterations and geometric properties of Mandelbrot-like sets can provide novel insights into structural and functional network dynamics. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions between structural (positive) and functional (signed) connectomes, such as the shift of cusp orientation and the variability in equi-M set geometry. Notably, structural connectomes exhibit more robust, predictable features, while functional connectomes show increased variability for non-trivial tasks. We further demonstrate that traditional graph-theoretical measures, when applied separately to the positive and negative sub-networks of functional connectomes, fail to fully capture their dynamic complexity. Instead, size and shape-based invariants of the equi-M set effectively differentiate between rest and emotional task states, which highlights their potential as superior markers of emergent network dynamics. These results suggest that incorporating fractal-based methods into network neuroscience provides a powerful tool for understanding how information flows in natural systems beyond static connectivity measures, while maintaining their simplicity.</description>

      <title>Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently-developed time series foundation models for scientific machine learning exhibit emergent abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context. Here, we show that foundation models applied to physical systems can give accurate predictions, but that they fail to develop meaningful representations of the underlying physics. Instead, foundation models often forecast by context parroting, a simple zero-shot forecasting strategy that copies directly from the context. As a result, a naive direct context parroting model scores higher than state-of-the-art time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains why large language models trained on text can be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the attractor, providing insight into the previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. Context parroting thus serves as a simple but tough-to-beat baseline for future time-series foundation models and can help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable many-body dynamics from space-time duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Intensity landscapes in elliptical and oval billiards with a circular absorbing region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08694</link>

Abstract: Billiard models of single particles moving freely in two-dimensional regions enclosed by hard walls, have long provided ideal toy models for the investigation of dynamical systems and chaos. Recently, billiards with (semi-)permeable walls and internal holes have been used to study open systems. Here we introduce a billiard model containing an internal region with partial absorption. The absorption does not change the trajectories, but instead reduces an intensity variable associated with each trajectory. The value of the intensity can be tracked as a function of the initial configuration and the number of reflections from the wall and depicted in intensity landscapes over the Poincar\'e phase space. This is similar in spirit to escape time diagrams that are often considered in dynamical systems with holes. We analyse the resulting intensity landscapes for three different geometries; a circular, elliptic, and oval billiard, respectively, all with a centrally placed circular absorbing region. The intensity landscapes feature increasingly more complex structures, organised around the sets of points that are a particular number of iteration away from the absorbing region, and enriched by effects arising from multiple absorption events for a given trajectory.</description>

      <title>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</description>
