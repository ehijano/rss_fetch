      <title>Impacts between multibody systems and deformable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions and impacts are the principal reasons for impulsive motions, which we frequently see in dynamic responses of systems. Precise modelling of impacts is a challenging problem due to the lack of the accurate and commonly accepted constitutive law that governs their mechanics. Rigid-body approach and soft contact methods are discussed in this paper and examined in the presented numerical examples. The main focus is set to impacts in systems with multiple unilateral contacts and collisions with elastic elements of the reference. Parameters of interconnecting unilateral springs are under discussion.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic potential of a rose-shaped disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on extensive numerical evidence, a recent paper (Sheng Chen et al., Eur. J. Phys. {\bf 45} (2024), 045703) suggested that the potential of a uniformly charged rose-shaped disk in the plane of the disk has a simple asymptotic form. We present an analytical proof of this interesting conjecture.</description>

      <title>Lambert's problem in orbital dynamics: a self--contained introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lambert's problem is a classical boundary value problem in analytical mechanics. It arises when trying to determine the energy required to place a particle, subject to a central gravitational potential, in a free fall trajectory connecting two given points on a desired travel time. Due to its mathematical beauty and its relevance in aerospace engineering, it has been and remains the object of attention of countless engineers, mathematicians (pure and applied), and physicists seeking to produce efficient solution algorithms. In this expository article, didactic in nature, we present a unified and comprehensive derivation that assumes only a minimal background in physics and mathematics. We focus on the simplest two--body case and carefully develop the argument for elliptical trajectories. The goal is to provide a single reference that can serve as an accelerated introduction for students and researchers interested in a quick introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>An $O(n$)-Algorithm for the Higher-Order Kinematics and Inverse Dynamics of Serial Manipulators using Spatial Representation of Twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Antenna Bandwidth and Quality Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After a brief history of the development of quality factor, useful expressions are derived for the robust input-impedance Qz(w) quality factor that accurately determines the VSWR fractional bandwidth of antennas for isolated resonances and a small enough bandwidth power drop. For closely spaced multiple resonances/antiresonances, a definitive formula is given for the increase in fractional bandwidth enabled by Bode-Fano tuning. Methods are given for determining the conventional and complex-energy quality factors of antennas from RLC circuit models. New field-based quality factors Q(w) are derived for antennas with known fields produced by an input current. These Q(w) are remarkably robust because they equal Qz(w) when the input impedance is available. Like Qz(w), the field-based Q(w) is independent of the choice of origin of the antenna fields and is impervious to extra lengths of transmission lines and surplus reactances. These robust field-based quality factors are used to derive new lower bounds on the quality factors (upper bounds on the bandwidths) of spherical-mode antennas that improve upon the previous Chu/CR (Collin-Rothschild) lower bounds for spherical modes. A criterion for antenna supergain is found by combining the Harrington maximum gain formula with the recently derived formula for the reactive power boundaries of antennas. Maximum gain versus minimum quality factor for spherical antennas are determined using the improved lower bounds on quality factor for different values of electrical size ka. Lastly, reduced antenna quality factors allowed by dispersive tuning overcome the traditional Chu/CR lower bounds for lower radiation efficiencies and small enough bandwidth power drops.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>
