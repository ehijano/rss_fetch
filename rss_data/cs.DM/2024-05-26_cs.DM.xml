      <title>Soft happy colourings and community structure of networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0&lt;\rho\leq 1$, a $\rho$-happy vertex $v$ in a coloured graph $G$ has at least $\rho\cdot \mathrm{deg}(v)$ same-colour neighbours, and a $\rho$-happy colouring (aka soft happy colouring) of $G$ is a vertex colouring that makes all the vertices $\rho$-happy. A community is a subgraph whose vertices are more adjacent to themselves than the rest of the vertices. Graphs with community structures can be modelled by random graph models such as the stochastic block model (SBM). In this paper, we present several theorems showing that both of these notions are related, with numerous real-world applications. We show that, with high probability, communities of graphs in the stochastic block model induce $\rho$-happy colouring on all vertices if certain conditions on the model parameters are satisfied. Moreover, a probabilistic threshold on $\rho$ is derived so that communities of a graph in the SBM induce a $\rho$-happy colouring. Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviour of $\rho$-happy colouring induced by the graph's communities is discussed when $\rho$ is less than a threshold. We develop heuristic polynomial-time algorithms for soft happy colouring that often correlate with the graphs' community structure. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation to compare the performance of the proposed algorithms thereby demonstrating the validity of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the minimum spectral radius of connected graphs of given order and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a question of Hong from 1993 related to the minimum spectral radii of the adjacency matrices of connected graphs of given order and size. Hong asked if it is true that among all connected graphs of given number of vertices $n$ and number of edges $e$, the graphs having minimum spectral radius (the minimizer graphs) must be almost regular, meaning that the difference between their maximum degree and their minimum degree is at most one. In this paper, we answer Hong's question positively for various values of $n$ and $e$ and in several cases, we determined the graphs with minimum spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Planar Cycle-Extendable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs -- that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as $1$-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lovasz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if -- for each even cycle $C$ -- the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as $1$-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng [Discrete Mathematics, 345:7 (2022), 112876] provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang [Discrete Mathematics, 275:1-3 (2004), 151-164] and independently Zhang and Li [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 160:13-14 (2012), 2069-2074], provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs -- in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>

      <title>A tame vs. feral dichotomy for graph classes excluding an induced minor or induced topological minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A minimal separator in a graph is an inclusion-minimal set of vertices that separates some fixed pair of nonadjacent vertices. A graph class is said to be tame if there exists a polynomial upper bound for the number of minimal separators of every graph in the class, and feral if it contains arbitrarily large graphs with exponentially many minimal separators. Building on recent works of Gartland and Lokshtanov [SODA 2023] and Gajarsk\'y, Jaffke, Lima, Novotn\'a, Pilipczuk, Rz\k{a}\.zewski, and Souza [arXiv, 2022], we show that every graph class defined by a single forbidden induced minor or induced topological minor is either tame or feral, and classify the two cases. This leads to new graph classes in which Maximum Weight Independent Set and many other problems are solvable in polynomial time. We complement the classification results with polynomial-time recognition algorithms for the maximal tame graph classes appearing in the obtained classifications.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration Algorithms for Cubic Modular Robots with Realistic Movement Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a model for self-reconfigurable robots made up of unit-cube modules. Compared to past models, our model aims to newly capture two important practical aspects of real-world robots. First, modules often do not occupy an exact unit cube, but rather have features like bumps extending outside the allotted space so that modules can interlock. Thus, for example, our model forbids modules from squeezing in between two other modules that are one unit distance apart. Second, our model captures the practical scenario of many passive modules assembled by a single robot, instead of requiring all modules to be able to move on their own.
  We prove two universality results. First, with a supply of auxiliary modules, we show that any connected polycube structure can be constructed by a carefully aligned plane sweep. Second, without additional modules, we show how to construct any structure for which a natural notion of external feature size is at least a constant; this property largely consolidates forbidden-pattern properties used in previous works on reconfigurable modular robots.</description>

      <title>Network Abstractions for Characterizing Communication Requirements in Asynchronous Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whereas distributed computing research has been very successful in exploring the solvability/impossibility border of distributed computing problems like consensus in representative classes of computing models with respect to model parameters like failure bounds, this is not the case for characterizing necessary and sufficient communication requirements. In this paper, we introduce network abstractions as a novel approach for modeling communication requirements in asynchronous distributed systems. A network abstraction of a run is a sequence of directed graphs on the set of processes, where the $i$-th graph specifies some ``potential'' message chains that can be guaranteed to arise in the $i$-th portion of the run. Formally, they are defined via associating message sending times with the end-to-end delays that would arise if the message was indeed sent by the sender's protocol. Network abstractions also allow to reason about future causal cones that might arise in a run, hence also facilitate reasoning about liveness properties, and are inherently compatible with temporal epistemic reasoning frameworks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by providing necessary and sufficient network abstractions for solving the canonical firing rebels with relay (FRR) problem, and variants thereof, in asynchronous message-passing systems with up to $f$ byzantine processes connected via point-to-point links. FRR is not only a basic primitive in clock synchronization and consensus algorithms, but also integrates several distributed computing problems, namely triggering events, agreement and even stabilizing agreement, in a single problem instance.</description>

      <title>Construction of orientable sequences in $O(1)$-amortized time per bit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ is a cyclic binary sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. Maximal length orientable sequences are known only for $n\leq 7$, and a trivial upper bound on their length is $2^{n-1} - 2^{\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor}$. This paper presents the first efficient algorithm to construct orientable sequences with asymptotically optimal length; more specifically, our algorithm constructs orientable sequences via cycle-joining and a successor-rule approach requiring $O(n)$ time per bit and $O(n)$ space. This answers a longstanding open question from Dai, Martin, Robshaw, Wild [Cryptography and Coding III (1993)]. Applying a recent concatenation-tree framework, the same sequences can be generated in $O(1)$-amortized time per bit using $O(n^2)$ space. Our sequences are applied to find new longest-known (aperiodic) orientable sequences for $n\leq 20$.</description>
