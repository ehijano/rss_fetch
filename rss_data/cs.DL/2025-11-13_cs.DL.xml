      <title>SciCom Wiki: A Digital Library to Support the Science Communication Knowledge Infrastructure for Videos and Podcasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Videos and Podcasts have established themselves as the medium of choice for civic dissemination, but also as carriers of misinformation. The emerging Science Communication Knowledge Infrastructure (SciCom KI), which curates these increasingly non-textual media, remains fragmented and inadequately equipped to scale against the content flood. Our work sets out to support the SciCom KI with a central, collaborative platform, the SciCom Wiki, to facilitate FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) media representation, particularly for videos and podcasts. We survey requirements from 53 stakeholders and individually refine these insights in 11 interviews. We then design and implement an open-source service system centered on Wikibase and evaluate our prototype with another 14 participants. Overall, our findings identified several needs to support the SciCom KI systematically. Our SciCom Wiki approach was found suitable to address the raised requirements. Further, we identified that the SciCom KI is severely underdeveloped regarding FAIR knowledge and related systems facilitating its collaborative creation and curation. Our system can provide a central knowledge node similar to Wikidata, yet a collaborative effort is required to scale the necessary features against the imminent (mis-)information flood.</description>

      <title>The Journal of Prompt-Engineered Philosophy Or: How I Started to Track AI Assistance and Stopped Worrying About Slop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Academic publishing increasingly requires authors to disclose AI assistance, yet imposes reputational costs for doing so--especially when such assistance is substantial. This article analyzes that structural contradiction, showing how incentives discourage transparency in precisely the work where it matters most. Traditional venues cannot resolve this tension through policy tweaks alone, as the underlying prestige economy rewards opacity. To address this, the article proposes an alternative publishing infrastructure: a venue outside prestige systems that enforces mandatory disclosure, enables reproduction-based review, and supports ecological validity through detailed documentation. As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars. While focused on AI, the framework speaks to broader questions about how academic systems handle methodological innovation.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Cartography of the Epistemic Diffusion of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuroscience and AI have an intertwined history, largely relayed in the literature of both fields. In recent years, due to the engineering orientations of AI research and the monopoly of industry for its large-scale applications, the mutual expansion of neuroscience and AI in fundamental research seems challenged. In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.</description>
