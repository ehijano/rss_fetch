      <title>Bisections of mass assignments by parallel hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a result on the bisection of mass assignments by parallel hyperplanes on Euclidean vector bundles. Our methods consist of the development of a novel lifting method to define the configuration space--test map scheme, which transforms the problem to a Borsuk--Ulam-type question on equivariant fiber bundles, along with a new computation of the parametrized Fadell--Husseini index. As the primary application, we show that any $d+k+m-1$ mass assignments to linear $d$-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^{d+m}$ can be bisected by $k $ parallel hyperplanes in at least one $d$-space, provided that the Stirling number of the second kind $S(d+k+m-1, k)$ is odd. This generalizes all known cases of a conjecture by Sober\'on and Takahashi, which asserts that any $d+k-1$ measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be bisected by $k$ parallel hyperplanes.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Free Topological Generalization Bounds via Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing generalization guarantees for stochastic optimization algorithms is a major challenge in modern learning theory. Recently, several studies highlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the generalization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a series of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the generalization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from topological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds rely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in specific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM), potentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we seek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization bounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce a novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies via proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing notion of \textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \textit{trajectory stability}, we prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be upper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the trajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory stability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great importance, especially as the number of training samples grows. This ultimately forms an explanation of the empirical success of the topological generalization bounds.</description>

      <title>Partitions of mass assignments with spheres and wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize classic mass partition results dealing with partitions using spheres, parallel hyperplanes, or axis-parallel wedges to the setting of mass assignments. In a mass assignment problem, we assign mass distributions continuously to all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and seek to guarantee the existence of a particular subspace in which more masses can be bisected than those by analyzing the problem in $\mathbb{R}^k$. We prove new mass assignment results for spheres, parallel hyperplanes, and axis-parallel wedges. The proof techniques rely on new Borsuk--Ulam type theorems on spheres and Stiefel manifolds.</description>

      <title>On higher real $K$-theories and finite spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study higher chromatic height analogues $eo_h$ of the connective real $K$-theory spectrum $ko$. We show that $eo_h$ is an fp spectrum of type $h$ in the sense of Mahowald--Rezk. We use these to study an Euler characteristic for fp spectra introduced by Ishan Levy, and give a partial answer to a question of Levy regarding the algebraic $K$-theory of the category of finite type $h$ spectra. As a corollary, we prove that if the generalized Moore spectrum $\mathbb{S}/(2^{i_0},v_1^{i_1},\ldots,v_h^{i_h})$ exists, then the $2$-adic valuation of $\prod i_j$ must exceed that of the height $h$.</description>

      <title>Torsion in Persistent Homology and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of torsion in hybrid deep learning models that incorporate topological data analysis, focusing on autoencoders. While most TDA tools use field coefficients, this conceals torsional features present in integer homology. We show that torsion can be lost during encoding, altered in the latent space, and in many cases, not reconstructed by standard decoders. Using both synthetic and high-dimensional data, we evaluate torsion sensitivity to perturbations and assess its recoverability across several autoencoder architectures. Our findings reveal key limitations of field-based approaches and underline the need for architectures or loss terms that preserve torsional information for robust data representation.</description>
