      <title>Geom-DeepONet: A Point-cloud-based Deep Operator Network for Field Predictions on 3D Parameterized Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern digital engineering design process commonly involves expensive repeated simulations on varying three-dimensional (3D) geometries. The efficient prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them a suitable surrogate to provide design insights. Nevertheless, few available NNs can handle solution prediction on varying 3D shapes. We present a novel deep operator network (DeepONet) variant called Geom-DeepONet, which encodes parameterized 3D geometries and predicts full-field solutions on an arbitrary number of nodes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature and is our primary novelty. In addition to expressing shapes using mesh coordinates, the signed distance function for each node is evaluated and used to augment the inputs to the trunk network of the Geom-DeepONet, thereby capturing both explicit and implicit representations of the 3D shapes. The powerful geometric encoding capability of a sinusoidal representation network (SIREN) is also exploited by replacing the classical feedforward neural networks in the trunk with SIREN. Additional data fusion between the branch and trunk networks is introduced by an element-wise product. A numerical benchmark was conducted to compare Geom-DeepONet to PointNet and vanilla DeepONet, where results show that our architecture trains fast with a small memory footprint and yields the most accurate results among the three with less than 2 MPa stress error. Results show a much lower generalization error of our architecture on unseen dissimilar designs than vanilla DeepONet. Once trained, the model can predict vector solutions, and speed can be over $10^5$ times faster than implicit finite element simulations for large meshes.</description>

      <title>Advanced Deep Operator Networks to Predict Multiphysics Solution Fields in Materials Processing and Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike classical artificial neural networks, which require retraining for each new set of parametric inputs, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), a lately introduced deep learning framework, approximates linear and nonlinear solution operators by taking parametric functions (infinite-dimensional objects) as inputs and mapping them to complete solution fields. In this paper, two newly devised DeepONet formulations with sequential learning and Residual U-Net (ResUNet) architectures are trained for the first time to simultaneously predict complete thermal and mechanical solution fields under variable loading, loading histories, process parameters, and even variable geometries. Two real-world applications are demonstrated: 1- coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of steel continuous casting with multiple visco-plastic constitutive laws and 2- sequentially coupled direct energy deposition for additive manufacturing. Despite highly challenging spatially variable target stress distributions, DeepONets can infer reasonably accurate full-field temperature and stress solutions several orders of magnitude faster than traditional and highly optimized finite-element analysis (FEA), even when FEA simulations are run on the latest high-performance computing platforms. The proposed DeepONet model's ability to provide field predictions almost instantly for unseen input parameters opens the door for future preliminary evaluation and design optimization of these vital industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Digital twin model of colon electromechanics for manometry prediction of laser tissue soldering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study introduces an advanced multi-physics and multi-scale modeling approach to investigate in silico colon motility. We introduce a generalized electromechanical framework, integrating cellular electrophysiology and smooth muscle contractility, thus advancing a first-of-its-kind computational model of laser tissue soldering after incision resection. The proposed theoretical framework comprises three main elements: a microstructural material model describing intestine wall geometry and composition of reinforcing fibers, with four fiber families, two active-conductive and two passive; an electrophysiological model describing the propagation of slow waves, based on a fully-coupled nonlinear phenomenological approach; and a thermodynamical consistent mechanical model describing the hyperelastic energetic contributions ruling tissue equilibrium under diverse loading conditions. The active strain approach was adopted to describe tissue electromechanics by exploiting the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient for each active fiber family and solving the governing equations via a staggered finite element scheme. The computational framework was fine-tuned according to state-of-the-art experimental evidence, and extensive numerical analyses allowed us to compare manometric traces computed via numerical simulations with those obtained clinically in human patients. The model proved capable of reproducing both qualitatively and quantitatively high or low-amplitude propagation contractions. Colon motility after laser tissue soldering demonstrates that material properties and couplings of the deposited tissue are critical to reproducing a physiological muscular contraction, thus restoring a proper peristaltic activity.</description>
