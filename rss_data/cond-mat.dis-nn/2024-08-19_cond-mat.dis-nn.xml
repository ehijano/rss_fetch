      <title>Tunable Hyperuniformity in Cellular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform materials, characterized by their suppressed density fluctuations and vanishing structure factors as the wave number approaches zero, represent a unique state of matter that straddles the boundary between order and randomness. These materials exhibit exceptional optical, mechanical, and acoustic properties, making them of great interest in materials science and engineering. Traditional methods for creating hyperuniform structures, including collective-coordinate optimization and centroidal Voronoi tessellations, have primarily been computational and face challenges in capturing the complexity of naturally occurring systems. This study introduces a comprehensive theoretical framework to generate hyperuniform structures inspired by the collective organization of biological cells within an epithelial tissue layer. By adjusting parameters such as cell elasticity and interfacial tension, we explore a spectrum of hyperuniform states from fluid to rigid, each exhibiting distinct mechanical properties and types of density fluctuations. Our results not only advance the understanding of hyperuniformity in biological tissues but also demonstrate the potential of these materials to inform the design of novel materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Power-law localization in one-dimensional systems with nonlinear disorder under fixed input conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical investigation into wave propagation and localization in one-dimensional lattices subject to nonlinear disorder, focusing on cases with fixed input conditions. Utilizing a discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Kerr-type nonlinearity and a random coefficient, we compute the averages and variances of the transmittance, $T$, and its logarithm, as functions of the system size $L$, while maintaining constant intensity for the incident wave. In cases of purely nonlinear disorder, we observe power-law localization characterized by $\langle T \rangle \propto L^{-\gamma_a}$ and $\langle \ln T \rangle \approx -\gamma_g \ln L$ for sufficiently large $L$. At low input intensities, a transition from exponential to power-law decay in $\langle T \rangle$ occurs as $L$ increases. The exponents $\gamma_a$ and $\gamma_g$ are nearly identical, converging to approximately 0.5 as the strength of the nonlinear disorder, $\beta$, increases. Additionally, the variance of $T$ decays according to a power law with an exponent close to 1, and the variance of $\ln T$ approaches a small constant as $L$ increases. These findings are consistent with an underlying log-normal distribution of $T$ and suggest that wave propagation behavior becomes nearly deterministic as the system size increases. When both linear and nonlinear disorders are present, we observe a transition from power-law to exponential decay in transmittance with increasing $L$ when the strength of linear disorder, $V$, is less than $\beta$. As $V$ increases, the region exhibiting power-law localization diminishes and eventually disappears when $V$ exceeds $\beta$, leading to standard Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Variational Tensor Neural Networks for Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (NNs) encounter scalability limitations when confronted with a vast array of neurons, thereby constraining their achievable network depth. To address this challenge, we propose an integration of tensor networks (TN) into NN frameworks, combined with a variational DMRG-inspired training technique. This in turn, results in a scalable tensor neural network (TNN) architecture capable of efficient training over a large parameter space. Our variational algorithm utilizes a local gradient-descent technique, enabling manual or automatic computation of tensor gradients, facilitating design of hybrid TNN models with combined dense and tensor layers. Our training algorithm further provides insight on the entanglement structure of the tensorized trainable weights and correlation among the model parameters. We validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method by designing TNN models and providing benchmark results for linear and non-linear regressions, data classification and image recognition on MNIST handwritten digits.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet patching, 1-form symmetries, and "Landau-star" phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions of gauge theories has relied heavily on simplifications that arise at the boundaries of phase diagrams, where certain excitations are forbidden. Taking 2+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory as an example, the simplification can be visualized geometrically: on the phase diagram boundaries the partition function is an ensemble of closed membranes. More generally, however, the membranes have "holes" in them, representing worldlines of virtual anyon excitations. If the holes are of a finite size, then typically they do not affect the universality class, but they destroy microscopic (higher-form) symmetries and microscopic (string) observables. We demonstrate how these symmetries and observables can be restored using a "membrane patching" procedure, which maps the ensemble of membranes back to an ensemble of closed membranes. (This is closely related to the idea of gauge fixing in the "minimal gauge", though not equivalent.) Membrane patching makes the emergence of higher symmetry concrete. Performing patching in a Monte Carlo simulation with an appropriate algorithm, we show that it gives access to numerically useful observables. For example, the confinement transition can be analyzed using a correlation function that is a power law at the critical point. We analyze the quasi-locality of the patching procedure and discuss what happens at a self-dual multicritical point in the gauge-Higgs model, where the lengthscale $\ell$ characterizing the holes diverges.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph exhibits the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. Given that Max-$q$-XORSAT on an Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph is known to exhibit the OGP, and since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>
