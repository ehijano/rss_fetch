      <title>On Boolean PCSPs with Polynomial Threshold Polymorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of a deeper understanding of Boolean Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems (PCSPs), we identify a class of problems with restricted structural complexity, which could serve as a promising candidate for complete characterization. Specifically, we investigate the class of PCSPs whose polymorphisms are Polynomial Threshold Functions (PTFs) of bounded degree. We obtain two complexity characterization results: (1) with a hardness condition introduced in [ACMTCT'21], we establish a complete complexity dichotomy in the case where coefficients of PTF representations are non-negative; (2) dropping the non-negativity assumption, we show a hardness result for PTFs admitting coordinates with significant influence, conditioned on the Rich 2-to-1 Conjecture proposed in [ITCS'21]. In order to prove the latter, we show that a random 2-to-1 minor map retains significant coordinate influence over the $p$-biased hypercube with constant probability.</description>

      <title>Unitary synthesis with fewer T gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm that implements an arbitrary $n$-qubit unitary operator using a Clifford+T circuit with T-count $O(2^{4n/3} n^{2/3})$. This improves upon the previous best known upper bound of $O(2^{3n/2} n)$, while the best known lower bound remains $\Omega(2^n)$. Our construction is based on a recursive application of the cosine-sine decomposition, together with a generalization of the optimal diagonal unitary synthesis method by Gosset, Kothari, and Wu to multi-controlled $k$-qubit unitaries.</description>

      <title>Physically-Motivated Guiding States for Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work characterises families of guiding states for the Guided Local Hamiltonian problem, revealing new connections between physical constraints and computational complexity. Focusing on states motivated by Quantum Chemistry and Hamiltonian Complexity, we extend prior BQP-hardness results beyond semi-classical subset states. We demonstrate that broader state families preserve hardness, while maintaining classical tractability under practical parameter regimes. Crucially, we provide a constructive proof of BQP containment for the canonical problem, showing the problem is BQP-complete when provided with a polynomial-size classical description of the guiding state. Our results show quantum advantage persists for physically meaningful state classes, and classical methods remain viable when guiding states admit appropriate descriptions. We identify a Goldilocks zone of guiding states that are efficiently preparable, succinctly described, and sample-query accessible, allowing for a meaningful comparison between quantum and classical approaches. Our work furthers the complexity landscape for ground state estimation problems, presenting steps toward experimentally relevant settings while clarifying the boundaries of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Succinct State Local Hamiltonian Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of the Local Hamiltonian problem under the promise that its ground state is succinctly represented. We show that the Succinct State 3-Local Hamiltonian problem is (promise) MA-complete. Our proof proceeds by systematically characterising succinct quantum states and modifying the original MA-hardness reduction. In particular, we show that a broader class of succinct states suffices to capture the hardness of the problem, extending and strengthening prior results to classes of Hamiltonians with lower locality.</description>

      <title>The Guided Local Hamiltonian Problem for Stoquastic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Guided Local Hamiltonian problem for stoquastic Hamiltonians is (promise) BPP-hard. The Guided Local Hamiltonian problem is a variant of the Local Hamiltonian problem that incorporates an additional input known as a guiding state, which is promised to overlap with the ground state. For a range of local Hamiltonian families, this problem is (promise) BQP-hard, though for stoquastic Hamiltonians, the complexity was previously unknown. Our results are achieved by first reducing from quantum-inspired BPP circuits to 6-local stoquastic Hamiltonians. We prove particular classes of quantum states, known as semi-classical encoded subset states, can guide the estimation of the ground state energy. Subsequent analysis shows the BPP-hardness is not dependent on the locality, i.e., the result holds for 2-local stoquastic Hamiltonians. Additional arguments further the BPP-hardness to Hamiltonians restricted to a square lattice. We also find for stoquastic Hamiltonians with a fixed local constraint on a subset of the system qubits, the Guided Local Hamiltonian problem is BQP-hard.</description>

      <title>Strong random unitaries and fast scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how fast physical systems can resemble Haar-random unitaries is a fundamental question in physics. Many experiments of interest in quantum gravity and many-body physics, including the butterfly effect in quantum information scrambling and the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, involve queries to a random unitary $U$ alongside its inverse $U^\dagger$, conjugate $U^*$, and transpose $U^T$. However, conventional notions of approximate unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) fail to capture these experiments. In this work, we introduce and construct strong unitary designs and strong PRUs that remain robust under all such queries. Our constructions achieve the optimal circuit depth of $O(\log n)$ for systems of $n$ qubits. We further show that strong unitary designs can form in circuit depth $O(\log^2 n)$ in circuits composed of independent two-qubit Haar-random gates, and that strong PRUs can form in circuit depth $\text{poly}(\log n)$ in circuits with no ancilla qubits. Our results provide an operational proof of the fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics: every observable feature of the fastest scrambling quantum systems reproduces Haar-random behavior at logarithmic times.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Crypto is Useless for Pseudorandom Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pseudorandom code is a keyed error-correction scheme with the property that any polynomial number of encodings appear random to any computationally bounded adversary. We show that the pseudorandomness of any code tolerating a constant rate of random errors cannot be based on black-box reductions to almost any generic cryptographic primitive: for instance, anything that can be built from random oracles, generic multilinear groups, and virtual black-box obfuscation. Our result is optimal, as Ghentiyala and Guruswami (2024) observed that pseudorandom codes tolerating any sub-constant rate of random errors exist using a black-box reduction from one-way functions.
  The key technical ingredient in our proof is the hypercontractivity theorem for Boolean functions, which we use to prove our impossibility in the random oracle model. It turns out that this easily extends to an impossibility in the presence of ``crypto oracles,'' a notion recently introduced -- and shown to be capable of implementing all the primitives mentioned above -- by Lin, Mook, and Wichs (EUROCRYPT 2025).</description>

      <title>The Serial Scaling Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential. These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical simulations to sequential decision-making-require sequentially dependent computational steps that cannot be efficiently parallelized. We formalize this distinction in complexity theory, and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face fundamental limitations on such tasks. Then, we show for first time that diffusion models despite their sequential nature are incapable of solving inherently serial problems. We argue that recognizing the serial nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model design, and hardware development.</description>
