      <title>A New Method for Sensorless Estimation of the Speed and Position in Brushed DC Motors Using Support Vector Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, for many applications, it is necessary to know the speed and position of motors. This can be achieved using mechanical sensors coupled to the motor shaft or using sensorless techniques. The sensorless techniques in brushed dc motors can be classified into two types: 1) techniques based on the dynamic brushed dc motor model and 2) techniques based on the ripple component of the current. This paper presents a new method, based on the ripple component, for speed and position estimation in brushed dc motors, using support vector machines. The proposed method only measures the current and detects the pulses in this signal. The motor speed is estimated by using the inverse distance between the detected pulses, and the position is estimated by counting all detected pulses. The ability to detect ghost pulses and to discard false pulses is the main advantage of this method over other sensorless methods. The performed tests on two fractional horsepower brushed dc motors indicate that the method works correctly in a wide range of speeds and situations, in which the speed is constant or varies dynamically.</description>

      <title>Radiation Efficiency and Gain Bounds for Microstrip Patch Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents radiation efficiency and gain bounds for microstrip patch antennas. The presented bounds are shown to be good predictors of antenna performance. Using the bounds, patch miniaturization techniques based on high permittivity substrates and geometrical shaping are compared. Further, a semi-analytic model is developed to approximate the bounds. Measurements are used to validate the bounds. Finally, maximum bandwidth of a microstrip patch antenna is linked to its maximum radiation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Estimation Algorithm and Decoupling Scheme for FRaC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the leaping advances in autonomous vehicles and transportation infrastructure, dual function radar-communication (DFRC) systems have become attractive due to the size, cost and resource efficiency. A frequency modulated continuous waveform (FMCW)-based radar-communication system (FRaC) utilizing both sparse multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) arrays and index modulation (IM) has been proposed to form a DFRC system specifically designed for vehicular applications. In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) parameter estimation problem in the FRaC is considered. Since the 3D-parameters including range, direction of arrival (DOA) and velocity are coupled in the estimating matrix of the FRaC system, the existing estimation algorithms cannot estimate the 3D-parameters accurately. Hence, a novel decomposed decoupled atomic norm minimization (DANM) method is proposed by splitting the 3D-parameter estimating matrix into multiple 2D matrices with sparsity constraints. Then, the 3D-parameters are estimated and efficiently and separately with the optimized decoupled estimating matrix. Moreover, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the 3D-parameter estimation are derived, and the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed decomposed DANM method exploits the advantage of the virtual aperture in the existence of coupling caused by IM and sparse MIMO array and outperforms the co-estimation algorithm with lower computation complexity.</description>

      <title>Decentralizing Coherent Joint Transmission Precoding via Fast ADMM with Deterministic Equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-cell interference (ICI) suppression is critical for multi-cell multi-user networks. In this paper, we investigate advanced precoding techniques for coordinated multi-point (CoMP) with downlink coherent joint transmission, an effective approach for ICI suppression. Different from the centralized precoding schemes that require frequent information exchange among the cooperating base stations, we propose a decentralized scheme to minimize the total power consumption. In particular, based on the covariance matrices of global channel state information, we estimate the ICI bounds via the deterministic equivalents and decouple the original design problem into sub-problems, each of which can be solved in a decentralized manner. To solve the sub-problems at each base station, we develop a low-complexity solver based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in conjunction with the convex-concave procedure (CCCP). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed decentralized precoding scheme, which achieves performance similar to the optimal centralized precoding scheme. Besides, our proposed ADMM solver can substantially reduce the computational complexity, while maintaining outstanding performance.</description>

      <title>Meta-Heuristic Fronthaul Bit Allocation for Cell-free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited capacity of fronthaul links in a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system can cause quantization errors at a central processing unit (CPU) during data transmission, complicating the centralized rate optimization problem. Addressing this challenge, we propose a harmony search (HS)-based algorithm that renders the combinatorial non-convex problem tractable. One of the distinctive features of our algorithm is its hierarchical structure: it first allocates resources at the access point (AP) level and subsequently optimizes for user equipment (UE), ensuring a more efficient and structured approach to resource allocation. Our proposed algorithm deals with rigorous conditions, such as asymmetric fronthaul bit allocation and distinct quantization error levels at each AP, which were not considered in previous works. We derive a closed-form expression of signal-to-interference-plusnoise ratio (SINR), in which additive quantization noise model (AQNM) based distortion error is taken into account, to define the mathematical expression of spectral efficiency (SE) for each UE. Also, we provide analyses on computational complexity and convergence to investigate the practicality of proposed algorithm. By leveraging various performance metrics such as total SE and max-min fairness, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can adaptively optimize the fronthaul bit allocation depending on system requirements. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve satisfactory performance while maintaining low computational complexity, as compared to the exhaustive search method</description>

      <title>A Multi-hop Secure UWOC assisted Local Area Network for UIoT and Underwater Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater environment is substantially less explored territory as compared to earth surface due to lack of robust underwater communication infrastructure. For Internet of Underwater things connectivity, underwater wireless optical communication can play a vital role, compared to conventional radio frequency communication, due to longer range, high data rate, low latency, and unregulated bandwidth. This study proposes underwater wireless optical communication driven local area network UWOC LAN, comprised of multiple network nodes with optical transceivers. Moreover, the temperature sensor data is encapsulated with individual authentication identity to enhance the security of the framework at the user end. The proposed system is evaluated in a specially designed water tank of 4 meters. The proposed system evaluation analysis shows that the system can transmit underwater temperature data reliably in real time. The proposed secure UWOC LAN is tested within a communication range of 16 meters by incorporating multi hop connectivity to monitor the underwater environment.</description>

      <title>Removing the need for ground truth UWB data collection: self-supervised ranging error correction using deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor positioning using UWB technology has gained interest due to its centimeter-level accuracy potential. However, multipath effects and non-line-of-sight conditions cause ranging errors between anchors and tags. Existing approaches for mitigating these ranging errors rely on collecting large labeled datasets, making them impractical for real-world deployments. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised deep reinforcement learning approach that does not require labeled ground truth data. A reinforcement learning agent uses the channel impulse response as a state and predicts corrections to minimize the error between corrected and estimated ranges. The agent learns, self-supervised, by iteratively improving corrections that are generated by combining the predictability of trajectories with filtering and smoothening. Experiments on real-world UWB measurements demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods, overcoming data dependency and lack of generalizability limitations. This makes self-supervised deep reinforcement learning a promising solution for practical and scalable UWB-ranging error correction.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pilot Design for OTFS in Linear Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the positioning of the pilot symbols, as well as the power distribution between the pilot and the communication symbols in the OTFS modulation scheme. We analyze the pilot placements that minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in estimating the channel taps. In addition, we optimize the average channel capacity by adjusting the power balance. We show that this leads to a significant increase in average capacity. The results provide valuable guidance for designing the OTFS parameters to achieve maximum capacity. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>V2X Enabled Emergency Vehicle Alert System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's major concern in traffic management systems includes time-efficient emergency transports. The awareness of environment and vehicle information is necessary for the emergency vehicles as well as the surrounding commercial vehicles that might be driven by inexperienced drivers to act accordingly if they both interact. The information exchange should be quick and accurate along with how much interactive the alerting system is with the drivers. Therefore, technologies like V2X-based alert systems can deal with such emergency situations and hence prevent potential health or social hazards. An alerting system as a part of a smart-connected city is proposed in this paper. The Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) based system has tried to cover the major domain of information about misbehaving vehicles, any pedestrians on the road, and information about the emergency vehicle itself. The commercial vehicle also will have a similar alert system as an application of V2V and V2I. Further in this paper, a realtime monitoring system was developed using grafana dashboard which will be installed in the area's base station to monitor the vehicles in that area.</description>

      <title>Channel Deduction: A New Learning Framework to Acquire Channel from Outdated Samples and Coarse Estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to reduce the pilot overhead required for channel estimation? How to deal with the channel dynamic changes and error propagation in channel prediction? To jointly address these two critical issues in next-generation transceiver design, in this paper, we propose a novel framework named channel deduction for high-dimensional channel acquisition in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, it makes use of the outdated channel information of past time slots, performs coarse estimation for the current channel with a relatively small number of pilots, and then fuses these two information to obtain a complete representation of the present channel. The rationale is to align the current channel representation to both the latent channel features within the past samples and the coarse estimate of current channel at the pilots, which, in a sense, behaves as a complementary combination of estimation and prediction and thus reduces the overall overhead. To fully exploit the highly nonlinear correlations in time, space, and frequency domains, we resort to learning-based implementation approaches. By using the highly efficient complex-domain multilayer perceptron (MLP)-mixer for crossing space-frequency domain representation and the recurrence-based or attention-based mechanisms for the past-present interaction, we respectively design two different channel deduction neural networks (CDNets). We provide a general procedure of data collection, training, and deployment to standardize the application of CDNets. Comprehensive experimental evaluations in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, which reduces the pilot overhead by up to 88.9% compared to state-of-the-art estimation approaches and enables continuous operating even under unknown user movement and error propagation.</description>

      <title>The Blind Normalized Stein Variational Gradient Descent-Based Detection for Intelligent Massive Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of an efficient preamble detection algorithm remains a challenge for solving preamble collision problems in intelligent massive random access (RA) in practical communication scenarios. To solve this problem, we present a novel early preamble detection scheme based on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model at the first step of the grant-based RA procedure. A novel blind normalized Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD)-based detector is proposed to obtain an approximate solution to the MLE model. First, by exploring the relationship between the Hadamard transform and wavelet transform, a new modified Hadamard transform (MHT) is developed to separate high-frequencies from important components using the second-order derivative filter. Next, to eliminate noise and mitigate the vanishing gradients problem in the SVGD-based detectors, the block MHT layer is designed based on the MHT, scaling layer, soft-thresholding layer, inverse MHT and sparsity penalty. Then, the blind normalized SVGD algorithm is derived to perform preamble detection without prior knowledge of noise power and the number of active devices. The experimental results show the proposed block MHT layer outperforms other transform-based methods in terms of computation costs and denoising performance. Furthermore, with the assistance of the block MHT layer, the proposed blind normalized SVGD algorithm achieves a higher preamble detection accuracy and throughput than other state-of-the-art detection methods.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in Large Language Model Integrated 6G Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the upcoming 6G era, vehicular networks are shifting from simple Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to the more complex Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity. At the forefront of this shift is the incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into vehicles. Known for their sophisticated natural language processing abilities, LLMs change how users interact with their vehicles. This integration facilitates voice-driven commands and interactions, departing from the conventional manual control systems. However, integrating LLMs into vehicular systems presents notable challenges. The substantial computational demands and energy requirements of LLMs pose significant challenges, especially in the constrained environment of a vehicle. Additionally, the time-sensitive nature of tasks in vehicular networks adds another layer of complexity. In this paper, we consider an edge computing system where vehicles process the initial layers of LLM computations locally, and offload the remaining LLM computation tasks to the Roadside Units (RSUs), envisioning a vehicular ecosystem where LLM computations seamlessly interact with the ultra-low latency and high-bandwidth capabilities of 6G networks. To balance the trade-off between completion time and energy consumption, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the vehicles and RSUs. The problem is then decomposed into two sub-problems, which are solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method and fractional programming technique. The simulation results clearly indicate that the algorithm we have proposed is highly effective in reducing both the completion time and energy consumption of the system.</description>

      <title>Pilot Signal and Channel Estimator Co-Design for Hybrid-Field XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the intricate task of hybrid-field channel estimation in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems, critical for the progression of 6G communications. Within these systems, comprising a line-of-sight (LoS) channel component alongside far-field and near-field scattering channel components, our objective is to tackle the channel estimation challenge. We encounter two central hurdles for ensuring dependable sparse channel recovery: the design of pilot signals and channel estimators tailored for hybrid-field communications. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a method to derive optimal pilot signals, aimed at minimizing the mutual coherence of the sensing matrix within the context of compressive sensing (CS) problems. These optimal signals are derived using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), ensuring robust performance in sparse channel recovery. Additionally, leveraging the acquired optimal pilot signal, we introduce a two-stage channel estimation approach that sequentially estimates the LoS channel component and the hybrid-field scattering channel components. Simulation results attest to the superiority of our co-designed approach for pilot signal and channel estimation over conventional CS-based methods, providing more reliable sparse channel recovery in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Statistical MIMO Radar and In-band Full-Duplex Multi-User MIMO Communications -- Part II: Joint Precoder, Radar Code, and Receive Filters Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of spectral sharing between a statistical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar and an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) communications system operating simultaneously in the same frequency band. Existing research on joint MIMO-radar-MIMO-communications (MRMC) systems has limitations, such as focusing on colocated MIMO radars, half-duplex MIMO communications, single-user scenarios, neglecting practical constraints, or employing separate transmit/receive units for MRMC coexistence. This paper, along with companion papers (Part I and III), proposes a comprehensive MRMC framework that addresses all these challenges. In the previous companion paper (Part I), we presented signal processing techniques for a distributed IBFD MRMC system. In this paper, we introduce joint design of statistical MIMO radar codes, uplink/downlink precoders, and corresponding receive filters using a novel metric called compounded-and-weighted sum mutual information. To solve the resulting highly non-convex problem, we employ a combination of block coordinate descent (BCD) and alternating projection methods. Numerical experiments show convergence of our algorithm, mitigation of uplink interference, and stable data rates under varying noise levels, channel estimate imperfections, and self-interference. The subsequent companion paper (Part III) extends the discussion to multiple targets and evaluates the tracking performance of our MRMC system.</description>

Abstract: As a next-generation wireless technology, the in-band full-duplex (IBFD) transmission enables simultaneous transmission and reception of signals over the same frequency, thereby doubling spectral efficiency. Further, a continuous up-scaling of wireless network carrier frequencies arising from ever-increasing data traffic is driving research on integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. In this context, we study the co-design of common waveforms, precoders, and filters for an IBFD multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with a distributed MIMO radar. This paper, along with companion papers (Part I and II), proposes a comprehensive MRMC framework that addresses all these challenges. In the companion papers, we developed signal processing and joint design algorithms for this distributed system. In this paper, we tackle multi-target detection, localization, and tracking. This co-design problem that includes practical MU-MIMO constraints on power and quality-of-service is highly non-convex. We propose a low-complexity procedure based on Barzilai-Borwein gradient algorithm to obtain the design parameters and mixed-integer linear program for distributed target localization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of multi-target sensing of the distributed FD ISAC system. Finally, we localize and track multiple targets by adapting the joint probabilistic data association and extended Kalman filter for this system.</description>

Abstract: The surge in demand for efficient radio resource management has necessitated the development of sophisticated yet compact neural network architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) tailored for radio resource management by presenting a new architecture: the Low Rank Message Passing Graph Neural Network (LR-MPGNN). The cornerstone of LR-MPGNN is the implementation of a low-rank approximation technique that substitutes the conventional linear layers with their low-rank counterparts. This innovative design significantly reduces the model size and the number of parameters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed LR-MPGNN model based on several key metrics: model size, number of parameters, weighted sum rate of the communication system, and the distribution of eigenvalues of weight matrices. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that the LR-MPGNN model achieves a sixtyfold decrease in model size, and the number of model parameters can be reduced by up to 98%. Performance-wise, the LR-MPGNN demonstrates robustness with a marginal 2% reduction in the best-case scenario in the normalized weighted sum rate compared to the original MPGNN model. Additionally, the distribution of eigenvalues of the weight matrices in the LR-MPGNN model is more uniform and spans a wider range, suggesting a strategic redistribution of weights.</description>

      <title>Deep CSI Compression for Dual-Polarized Massive MIMO Channels with Disentangled Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for achieving the promised advantages of enhancing spectral and energy efficiencies in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proven effective in reducing the required signaling overhead for CSI feedback. In practical dual-polarized MIMO scenarios, channels in the vertical and horizontal polarization directions tend to exhibit high polarization correlation. To fully exploit the inherent propagation similarity within dual-polarized channels, we propose a disentangled representation neural network (NN) for CSI feedback, referred to as DiReNet. The proposed DiReNet disentangles dual-polarized CSI into three components: polarization-shared information, vertical polarization-specific information, and horizontal polarization-specific information. This disentanglement of dual-polarized CSI enables the minimization of information redundancy caused by the polarization correlation and improves the performance of CSI compression and recovery. Additionally, flexible quantization and network extension schemes are designed. Consequently, our method provides a pragmatic solution for CSI feedback to harness the physical MIMO polarization as a priori information. Our experimental results show that the performance of our proposed DiReNet surpasses that of existing DL-based networks, while also effectively reducing the number of network parameters by nearly one third.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free MIMO Perceptive Mobile Networks: Cloud vs. Edge Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceptive mobile networks implement sensing and communication by reusing existing cellular infrastructure. Cell-free multiple-input multiple-output, thanks to the cooperation among distributed access points, supports the deployment of multistatic radar sensing, while providing high spectral efficiency for data communication services. To this end, the distributed access points communicate over fronthaul links with a central processing unit acting as a cloud processor. This work explores four different types of PMN uplink solutions based on Cell-free multiple-input multiple-output, in which the sensing and decoding functionalities are carried out at either cloud or edge. Accordingly, we investigate and compare joint cloud-based decoding and sensing (CDCS), hybrid cloud-based decoding and edge-based sensing (CDES), hybrid edge-based decoding and cloud-based sensing (EDCS) and edge-based decoding and sensing (EDES). In all cases, we target a unified design problem formulation whereby the fronthaul quantization of signals received in the training and data phases are jointly designed to maximize the achievable rate under sensing requirements and fronthaul capacity constraints. Via numerical results, the four implementation scenarios are compared as a function of the available fronthaul resources by highlighting the relative merits of edge- and cloud-based sensing and communications. This study provides guidelines on the optimal functional allocation in fronthaul-constrained networks implementing integrated sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>Transmissive RIS Transmitter Enabled Spatial Modulation for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transmitter-enabled spatial modulation (SM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In the transmission phase, a column-wise activation strategy is implemented for the TRIS panel, where the specific column elements are activated per time slot. Concurrently, the receiver employs the maximum likelihood detection technique. Based on this, for the transmit signals, we derive the closed-form expressions for the upper bounds of the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the proposed scheme from different perspectives, employing both vector-based and element-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide the asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ABEP of the TRIS-SM scheme, as well as the diversity gain. To improve the performance of the proposed TRIS-SM system, we optimize ABEP with a fixed data rate. Additionally, we provide lower bounds to simplify the computational complexity of improved TRIS-SM scheme. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to validate the theoretical derivations exhaustively. The results demonstrate that the proposed TRIS-SM scheme can achieve better ABEP performance compared to the conventional SM scheme. Furthermore, the improved TRIS-SM scheme outperforms the TRIS-SM scheme in terms of reliability.</description>

      <title>Deep decomposition method for the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a deep learning approach to the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem. It is well known that traditional deep learning relies solely on data, which may limit its performance for the inverse problem when only indirect observation data and a physical model are available. A fundamental question arises in light of these limitations: is it possible to enable deep learning to work on inverse problems without labeled data and to be aware of what it is learning? This work proposes a deep decomposition method (DDM) for such purposes, which does not require ground truth labels. It accomplishes this by providing physical operators associated with the scattering model to the neural network architecture. Additionally, a deep learning based data completion scheme is implemented in DDM to prevent distorting the solution of the inverse problem for limited aperture data. Furthermore, apart from addressing the ill-posedness imposed by the inverse problem itself, DDM is a physics-aware machine learning technique that can have interpretability property. The convergence result of DDM is theoretically proven. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed DDM even when the incident and observation apertures are extremely limited.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Statistical MIMO Radar and In-band Full-Duplex Multi-User MIMO Communications -- Part I: Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.14774v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a spectral sharing problem in which a statistical (or widely distributed) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar and an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) communications system concurrently operate within the same frequency band. Prior works on joint MIMO-radar-MIMO-communications (MRMC) systems largely focus on either colocated MIMO radars, half-duplex MIMO communications, single-user scenarios, omit practical constraints (clutter, uplink [UL]/downlink [DL] transmit powers, UL/DL quality-of-service, and peak-to-average-power ratio), or MRMC co-existence that employs separate transmit/receive units. The purpose of this and companion papers (Part II and III) is to co-design an MRMC framework that addresses all of these issues. In this paper, we propose signal processing for a distributed IBFD MRMC, where radar receiver is designed to additionally exploit the downlink communications signals reflected from a radar target. Extensive numerical experiments show that our methods improve radar target detection over conventional codes and yield a higher achievable data rate than standard precoders. The following companion paper (Part II) describes the theory and procedure of our algorithm to solve the non-convex design problem. The final companion paper (Part II) considers the case of multiple targets and examines the tracking performance of our MRMC system.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation via Successive Denoising in MIMO OFDM Systems: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10300v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, reliable communication via multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) requires accurate channel estimation at the receiver. The existing literature largely focuses on denoising methods for channel estimation that depend on either (i) channel analysis in the time-domain with prior channel knowledge or (ii) supervised learning techniques which require large pre-labeled datasets for training. To address these limitations, we present a frequency-domain denoising method based on a reinforcement learning framework that does not need a priori channel knowledge and pre-labeled data. Our methodology includes a new successive channel denoising process based on channel curvature computation, for which we obtain a channel curvature magnitude threshold to identify unreliable channel estimates. Based on this process, we formulate the denoising mechanism as a Markov decision process, where we define the actions through a geometry-based channel estimation update, and the reward function based on a policy that reduces mean squared error (MSE). We then resort to Q-learning to update the channel estimates. Numerical results verify that our denoising algorithm can successfully mitigate noise in channel estimates. In particular, our algorithm provides a significant improvement over the practical least squares (LS) estimation method and provides performance that approaches that of the ideal linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation with perfect knowledge of channel statistics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deep Learning-based Estimation of the Vital Signs on Smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing use of smartphones in our daily lives, these devices have become capable of performing many complex tasks. Concerning the need for continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially for the elderly or those with certain types of diseases, the development of algorithms that can estimate vital signs using smartphones has attracted researchers worldwide. In particular, researchers have been exploring ways to estimate vital signs, such as heart rate, oxygen saturation levels, and respiratory rate, using algorithms that can be run on smartphones. However, many of these algorithms require multiple pre-processing steps that might introduce some implementation overheads or require the design of a couple of hand-crafted stages to obtain an optimal result. To address this issue, this research proposes a novel end-to-end solution to mobile-based vital sign estimation using deep learning that eliminates the need for pre-processing. By using a fully convolutional architecture, the proposed model has much fewer parameters and less computational complexity compared to the architectures that use fully-connected layers as the prediction heads. This also reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, a public dataset for vital sign estimation, which includes 62 videos collected from 35 men and 27 women, is provided. Overall, the proposed end-to-end approach promises significantly improved efficiency and performance for on-device health monitoring on readily available consumer electronics.</description>

      <title>Channel Measurement, Modeling, and Simulation for 6G: A Survey and Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) mobile communications have attracted substantial attention in the global research community of information and communication technologies (ICT). 6G systems are expected to support not only extended 5G usage scenarios, but also new usage scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication, and communication and ubiquitous connectivity. To realize this goal, channel characteristics must be comprehensively studied and properly exploited, so as to promote the design, standardization, and optimization of 6G systems. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements and challenges in 6G channel research. Our focus is on channels for five promising technologies enabling 6G, including terahertz (THz), extreme MIMO (E-MIMO), ISAC, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Then, a survey of the progress of the 6G channel research regarding the above five promising technologies is presented in terms of the latest measurement campaigns, new characteristics, modeling methods, and research prospects. Moreover, a tutorial on the 6G channel simulations is presented. We introduce the BUPTCMG- 6G, a 6G link-level channel simulator, developed based on the ITU/3GPP 3D geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) methodology. The simulator supports the channel simulation of the aforementioned 6G potential technologies. To facilitate the use of the simulator, the tutorial encompasses the design framework, user guidelines, and application examples. This paper offers in-depth, hands-on insights into the best practices of channel measurements, modeling, and simulations for the evaluation of 6G technologies, the development of 6G standards, and the implementation and optimization of 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Variational Autoencoders for Parameterized MMSE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose to use a variational autoencoder-based framework for parameterizing a conditional linear minimum mean squared error estimator. The variational autoencoder models the underlying unknown data distribution as conditionally Gaussian, yielding the conditional first and second moments of the estimand, given a noisy observation. The derived estimator is shown to approximate the minimum mean squared error estimator by utilizing the variational autoencoder as a generative prior for the estimation problem. We propose three estimator variants that differ in their access to ground-truth data during the training and estimation phases. The proposed estimator variant trained solely on noisy observations is particularly noteworthy as it does not require access to ground-truth data during training or estimation. We conduct a rigorous analysis by bounding the difference between the proposed and the minimum mean squared error estimator, connecting the training objective and the resulting estimation performance. Furthermore, the resulting bound reveals that the proposed estimator entails a bias-variance tradeoff, which is well-known in the estimation literature. As an example application, we portray channel estimation, allowing for a structured covariance matrix parameterization and low-complexity implementation. Nevertheless, the proposed framework is not limited to channel estimation but can be applied to a broad class of estimation problems. Extensive numerical simulations first validate the theoretical analysis of the proposed variational autoencoder-based estimators and then demonstrate excellent estimation performance compared to related classical and machine learning-based state-of-the-art estimators.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Evaluation of Euclidean Alignment with Deep Learning for EEG Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for various Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) tasks. While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have shown promising results, they are hindered by the substantial data requirements. By leveraging data from multiple subjects, transfer learning enables more effective training of DL models. A technique that is gaining popularity is Euclidean Alignment (EA) due to its ease of use, low computational complexity, and compatibility with Deep Learning models. However, few studies evaluate its impact on the training performance of shared and individual DL models. In this work, we systematically evaluate the effect of EA combined with DL for decoding BCI signals. We used EA to train shared models with data from multiple subjects and evaluated its transferability to new subjects. Our experimental results show that it improves decoding in the target subject by 4.33% and decreases convergence time by more than 70%. We also trained individual models for each subject to use as a majority-voting ensemble classifier. In this scenario, using EA improved the 3-model ensemble accuracy by 3.7%. However, when compared to the shared model with EA, the ensemble accuracy was 3.62% lower.</description>

      <title>Model-Driven Sensing-Node Selection and Power Allocation for Tracking Maneuvering Targets in Perceptive Mobile Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maneuvering target tracking will be an important service of future wireless networks to assist innovative applications such as intelligent transportation. However, tracking maneuvering targets by cellular networks faces many challenges. For example, the dense network and high-speed targets make the selection of the sensing nodes (SNs) and the associated power allocation very challenging. Existing methods demonstrated engaging performance, but with high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a model-driven deep learning (DL)-based approach for SN selection. To this end, we first propose an iterative SN selection method by jointly exploiting the majorization-minimization (MM) framework and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then, we unfold the iterative algorithm as a deep neural network and prove its convergence. The proposed method achieves lower computational complexity, because the number of layers is less than the number of iterations required by the original algorithm, and each layer only involves simple matrix-vector additions/multiplications. Finally, we propose an efficient power allocation method based on fixed point (FP) water filling and solve the joint SN selection and power allocation problem under the alternative optimization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the conventional optimization-based methods with much lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>GAN-supervised Seismic Data Reconstruction: An Enhanced-Learning for Improved Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seismic data interpolation of irregularly missing traces plays a crucial role in subsurface imaging, enabling accurate analysis and interpretation throughout the seismic processing workflow. Despite the widespread exploration of deep supervised learning methods for seismic data reconstruction, several challenges still remain open. Particularly, the requirement of extensive training data and poor domain generalization due to the seismic survey's variability poses significant issues. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a deep-learning-based seismic data reconstruction approach that leverages data redundancy. This method involves a two-stage training process. First, an adversarial generative network (GAN) is trained using synthetic seismic data, enabling the extraction and learning of their primary and local seismic characteristics. Second, a reconstruction network is trained with synthetic data generated by the GAN, which dynamically adjusts the noise and distortion level at each epoch to promote feature diversity. This approach enhances the generalization capabilities of the reconstruction network by allowing control over the generation of seismic patterns from the latent space of the GAN, thereby reducing the dependency on large seismic databases. Experimental results on field and synthetic seismic datasets both pre-stack and post-stack show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline supervised learning and unsupervised approaches such as deep seismic prior and internal learning, by up to 8 dB of PSNR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundational models benefit from pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data and enable strong performance in a wide variety of applications with a small amount of labeled data. Such models can be particularly effective in analyzing brain signals, as this field encompasses numerous application scenarios, and it is costly to perform large-scale annotation. In this work, we present the largest foundation model in brain signals, Brant-2. Compared to Brant, a foundation model designed for intracranial neural signals, Brant-2 not only exhibits robustness towards data variations and modeling scales but also can be applied to a broader range of brain neural data. By experimenting on an extensive range of tasks, we demonstrate that Brant-2 is adaptive to various application scenarios in brain signals. Further analyses reveal the scalability of the Brant-2, validate each component's effectiveness, and showcase our model's ability to maintain performance in scenarios with scarce labels.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Capacity-Distortion Trade-Offs in Memoryless ISAC Systems</title>

Abstract: This manuscript investigates the information-theoretic limits of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), aiming for simultaneous reliable communication and precise channel state estimation. We model such a system with a state-dependent discrete memoryless channel (SD-DMC) with present or absent channel feedback and generalized side information at the transmitter and the receiver, where the joint task of message decoding and state estimation is performed at the receiver. The relationship between the achievable communication rate and estimation error, the capacity-distortion (C-D) trade-off, is characterized across different causality levels of the side information. This framework is shown to be capable of modeling various practical scenarios by assigning the side information with different meanings, including monostatic and bistatic radar systems. The analysis is then extended to the two-user degraded broadcast channel, and we derive an achievable C-D region that is tight under certain conditions. To solve the optimization problem arising in the computation of C-D functions/regions, we propose a proximal block coordinate descent (BCD) method, prove its convergence to a stationary point, and derive a stopping criterion. Finally, several representative examples are studied to demonstrate the versatility of our framework and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks with Blockage Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18621</link>

Abstract: Communication-sensing integration represents an up-and-coming area of research, enabling wireless networks to simultaneously perform communication and sensing tasks. However, in urban cellular networks, the blockage of buildings results in a complex signal propagation environment, affecting the performance analysis of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework considering building blockage and employs a distance-correlated blockage model to analyze interference from line of sight (LoS), non-line of sight (NLoS), and target reflection cascading (TRC) links. Using stochastic geometric theory, expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and coverage probability for communication and sensing in the presence of blockage are derived, allowing for a comprehensive comparison under the same parameters. The research findings indicate that blockage can positively impact coverage, especially in enhancing communication performance. The analysis also suggests that there exists an optimal base station (BS) density when blockage is of the same order of magnitude as the BS density, maximizing communication or sensing coverage probability.</description>
