      <title>Broken Symmetries, Information and Emergence: What is theory, that biology should be mindful of it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discipline of `theoretical biology' has been developing from its inception several decades ago almost in parallel with the advances in biology, so much so that the latter is often considered to be almost exclusively an empirical science. However, the scenario has been changing in recent years with statistical mechanics, nonlinear dynamics and soft-matter physics being more and more frequently invoked to explain various biological observations. As distinct from computational biology, theoretical biology is not just an attempt to reproduce in-silico experimental phenomena, but asks more general and abstract questions. It strives to attain a more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying biological phenomena, ranging from oscillations to strategic actions, that can be unified through the perspective that views organisms as processing information to respond appropriately despite the noise in their environment. We show through a number of investigations carried out by our group, on the emergence of systems-level phenomena through interactions between components, how an approach melding physics, and the theory of information &amp; computation can act as an unifying framework for biological processes across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Acoustic-Driven Surface Cleaning with Millimeter-Sized Bubbles at Translational Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional surface cleaning methods often suffer from drawbacks such as chemical harshness, potential for surface damage, and high energy consumption. This study investigates an alternative approach: acoustic-driven surface cleaning using millimeter-sized bubbles excited at low, sub-cavitation frequencies. We identify and characterize a distinct translational resonance of these bubbles, occurring at significantly lower frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz for 1.3 mm diameter bubbles) than the Minnaert resonance for a bubble of the same size. Experiments reveal that at this translational resonance, stationary bubbles exhibit amplified lateral swaying, while bubbles sliding on an inclined surface display pronounced "stop-and-go" dynamics. The theoretical model treats the bubble as a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, where surface tension provides the restoring force and the inertia is dominated by the hydrodynamic added mass of the surrounding fluid. It accurately predicts the observed resonant frequency scaling with bubble size ($\propto R_0^{-3/2}$). Cleaning efficacy, assessed using protein-based artificial soil on glass slides, was improved by approximately 90\% when bubbles were driven at their translational resonant frequency compared to off-resonant frequencies or non-acoustic conditions. These findings demonstrate that leveraging translational resonance enhances bubble-induced shear and agitation, offering an effective and sustainable mechanism for surface cleaning.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Solution for Skin Heating by an Electromagnetic Beam at an Incident Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temperature evolution in the three-dimensional skin tissue exposed to a millimeter-wave electromagnetic beam that is not necessarily perpendicular to the skin surface. This study examines the effect of the beam's incident angle. The incident angle influences the thermal heating in two aspects: (i) the beam spot projected onto the skin is elongated compared to the intrinsic beam spot in a perpendicular cross section, resulting in a lower power per skin area; and (ii) within the tissue, the beam propagates at the refracted angle relative to the depth direction. At millimeter-wavelength frequencies, the characteristic penetration depth is sub-millimeter, whereas the lateral extent of the beam spans at least several centimeters in applications. We explore the small ratio of the penetration depth to the lateral length scale in a non-dimensional formulation and derive a leading-term asymptotic solution for the temperature distribution. This analysis does not rely on a small incident angle and is therefore applicable to arbitrary angles of incidence. Based on the asymptotic solution, we establish scaling laws for the three-dimensional skin temperature, the skin surface temperature, and the skin volume in which thermal nociceptors are activated.</description>

      <title>Slow and Fast Neurons Cooperate in Contextual Working Memory through Timescale Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural systems process information across a broad range of intrinsic timescales, both within and across cortical areas. While such diversity is a hallmark of biological networks, its computational role in nonlinear information processing remains elusive. In this study, we examine how heterogeneity in intrinsic neural timescales within the frontal cortex - a region central to cognitive control - enhances performance in a context-dependent working memory task. We develop a recurrent neural network (RNN) composed of units with distinct time constants to model a delayed match-to-sample task with contextual cues. This task demands nonlinear integration of temporally dispersed inputs and flexible behavioral adaptation. Our analysis shows that task performance is optimized when fast and slow timescales are appropriately balanced. Intriguingly, slow neurons, despite weaker encoding of task-relevant inputs, play a causal role in sustaining memory and improving performance. In contrast, fast neurons exhibit strong but transient encoding of input signals. These results highlight a division of computational roles among neurons with different timescales: slow dynamics support stable internal states, while fast dynamics enable rapid signal encoding. Our findings provide a mechanistic account of how temporal heterogeneity contributes to nonlinear information processing in neural circuits, shedding light on the dynamic architecture underlying cognitive flexibility.</description>

      <title>High resolution quantum enhanced phase imaging of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering both amplitude and phase information from a system is a fundamental goal of optical imaging. At the same time, it is crucial to use a low photon dose to avoid altering the system, particularly when dealing with biological samples. Quantum imaging offers a powerful approach for extracting more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction and spatial resolution has been considered a major drawback to the application of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they could offer the most significant benefits. In this work, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating a resolution-independent quantum advantage. We achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture, while simultaneously attaining quantum noise reduction. This enables, for the first time, sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells. Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a quasi-single-shot wide-field mode, retrieves both phase and amplitude information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it intrinsically fast and stable. These results pave the way for the immediate application of sub-shot-noise imaging in biology.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limits on general far-from-equilibrium molecular templating networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells produce RNA and proteins via molecular templating networks. We show that information transmission in such networks is bounded by functions of a simple thermodynamic property of the network, regardless of complexity. Surprisingly, putative systems operating at this bound do not have a high flux around the network. Instead, they have low entropy production, with each product in a ``pseudo-equilibrium'' determined by a single pathway. These pseudo-equilibrium limits constrain information transmission for the overall network, even if individual templates are arbitrarily specific.</description>

      <title>Monitoring microplastics in live reef-building corals with microscopic laser particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro- and nanoplastics pose a growing threat to reef-building corals. Yet, understanding of their uptake, interaction with coral tissue and long-term incorporation into coral skeletons remains limited in large part due to the invasive nature of existing methods for monitoring and localizing microplastic. Here, we repurpose optical resonances in polymer spheres to transform microplastic particles into microscopic lasers. These laser particles emit distinctive and stable spectral signatures that are used as optical barcodes and thus enable in vivo tracking of microplastics in optically opaque coral fragments. Simultaneously, they provide a platform for real-time sensing of dynamic changes at the microplastic surface with nanoscale resolution, shedding light on the internalization and transport of individual microplastic particles in live corals, e.g. as part of the complex marine food web.</description>

      <title>Key Issues Review: Useful autonomous quantum machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to increasingly grant them autonomy, freeing them from time-dependent external control. For example, autonomy could pare down the classical control wires that heat and decohere quantum circuits; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset a superconducting qubit to near its ground state, as is necessary before a computation. Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cellular nematic order is a conserved feature of gastrulation in animal embryos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells undergo dramatic morphological changes during embryogenesis, yet how these changes affect the formation of ordered tissues remains elusive. Here, we show that a phase transition leading to the formation of a nematic liquid crystal state during gastrulation in the development of embryos of fish, frogs, and fruit flies occurs by a common mechanism despite substantial differences between these evolutionarily distant animals. Importantly, nematic order forms early before any discernible changes in the shapes of cells. All three species exhibit similar propagation of the nematic phase, reminiscent of nucleation and growth mechanisms. The spatial correlations in the nematic phase in the notochord region are long-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~$x^{-\alpha}$ ) with $\alpha$ less than unity, indicating a common underlying physical mechanism. To explain the common physical mechanism, we created a theoretical model that not only explains the experimental observations but also predicts that the nematic phase should be disrupted upon loss of planar cell polarity (frog), cell adhesion (frog), and notochord boundary formation (zebrafish). Gene knockdown or mutational studies confirm the theoretical predictions. The combination of experiments and theory provides a unified framework for understanding the potentially universal features of metazoan embryogenesis, in the process shedding light on the advent of ordered structures during animal development.</description>
