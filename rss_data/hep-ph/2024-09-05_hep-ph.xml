      <title>Electroweak gauge invariant Higgs multiplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of general Higgs multiplets. We establish the domain of general Higgs multiplets within the context of the adjoint representation. The construction of the most general potential for arbitrary multiplets is achieved using the irreducible, totally symmetric representation of tensor products of doublets. Furthermore, we explore symmetry transformations of the Higgs multiplets, with particular emphasis on CP symmetries.</description>

      <title>Monojets from compressed weak frustrated dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the so-called hyperchargeless Higgs triplet model to include a weak triplet of Dirac fermions and a Dirac fermion $X$ transforming trivially under the Standard Model gauge group. We are motivated in part by a collection of anomalies that can be interpreted as a new scalar state with mass of approximately 152 GeV coupling to $W$ but not $Z$ bosons, which may be consistent with the electrically neutral triplet scalar in this model (provided that it mixes very slightly with the Standard Model Higgs boson). Meanwhile, the lightest neutral fermion in the model is stable and can be thermal dark matter with the correct relic abundance if it mixes lightly with the neutral triplet fermion, such that the dark matter is composed mostly of $X$. Because $X$ couples to the Standard Model only through a Yukawa-like interaction with the pair of triplets, this model falls into the frustrated dark matter paradigm. Finally, the spectrum of exotic fermions in this model can exhibit the strong compression favored by the current excess in the monojet channel, and evades multijet constraints in the region favored by monojets. In this work we explore this model's phenomenology and compare the parameter space regions best suited to each of the aforementioned excesses and constraints.</description>

      <title>Jet observables in heavy ion collisions : a white paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of a survey of jet substructure observables used to study modifications of jets induced by interaction with a Quark Gluon Plasma. We further outline ideas that were presented and discussed at the \textit{New jet quenching tools to explore equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics in heavy-ion collisions} workshop, which was held in February 2024 at the ECT$^{*}$ in Trento, Italy. The goal of this white paper is to provide a brief report on the study of jet quenching observables earlier conducted and to present new ideas that could be relevant for future explorations.</description>

      <title>ADFilter -- A Web Tool for New Physics Searches With Autoencoder-Based Anomaly Detection Using Deep Unsupervised Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A web-based tool called ADFilter was developed to process collision events using autoencoders based on a deep unsupervised neural network. The autoencoders are trained on a small fraction of either collision data or Standard Model Monte Carlo simulations. The tool calculates loss distributions for input events, helping to determine the degree to which the events can be considered anomalous. It also calculates two-body invariant masses both before and after the autoencoders, as well as cross sections. Real-life examples are provided to demonstrate how the tool can be used to reinterpret existing LHC results with the goal of significantly improving exclusion limits.</description>

      <title>WIMP dark matter in bulk viscous non-standard cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explored an extension of the classical non-standard cosmological scenario in which the new field, $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component in the early universe, experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity. Assuming an interaction term given by $\Gamma_{\phi}\rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ accounts for the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ corresponds to its energy density, and a bulk viscosity according to the expression $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$ in the framework of Eckart's theory, we apply this novel non-standard cosmology to study the parameters space for WIMPs Dark Matter candidate production. This parameter space shows deviations from the classical non-standard cosmological scenario, obtaining new regions to search for this candidate. In particular, for certain combinations of the free parameters, we found large regions in which the model can establish the DM and reproduce the current observable relic density.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

      <title>Search for singly charmed dibaryons in baryon-baryon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematical investigation of the singly charmed dibaryon system with strangeness numbers $S=-1$, $-3$ and $-5$ in the framework of the chiral quark model. Two resonance states with strangeness numbers $S=-1$ are obtained in the baryon-baryon scattering process. In the $\Lambda\Lambda_{c}$ scattering phase shifts, the $\Sigma\Sigma_{c}$ appears as a resonance state with the mass and width 3591 MeV and 11.1 MeV, respectively. In the $N\Xi_{c}$ and $N\Xi^{\prime}_{c}$ scattering phase shifts, the $\Sigma\Sigma^{\ast}_{c}$ exhibits as a resonance state with the mass and width 3621-3624 MeV and 14.9 MeV, respectively. All these heavy-flavor dibaryons are worth searching for in experiments. Besides, we would like to emphasize that the coupling calculation between the bound channels and open channels is indispensable. The study of the scattering process maybe an effective way to look for the genuine resonances.</description>

      <title>Further study of the maximally symmetry breaking patterns in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theoryNing Chen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ${\rm SU}(8)$ was previously found to be the minimal simple gauge group where all three-generational Standard Model fermions can be non-trivially embedded, and it is maximally broken into ${\rm SU}(8)\to {\cal G}_{441}\equiv {\rm SU}(4)_s \otimes {\rm SU}(4)_W \otimes {\rm U}(1)_{X_0}$ at the GUT scale by the ${\rm SU}(8)$ adjoint Higgs field. Gauge symmetries in the strong and the weak sectors are extended by one and two ranks, respectively. The sequential strong-weak-weak (SWW) symmetry breaking stages were found to generate the observed hierarchical SM quark/lepton masses as well as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing pattern with the precise flavor identifications [1, 2]. We further study the possible weak-strong-weak (WSW) and weak-weak-strong (WWS) symmetry breaking patterns, and compare with the results that we have obtained by following the SWW sequence. The two-loop RGEs following both patterns are derived, where we cannot achieve the gauge coupling unification in the field theory framework. Based on these analyses, we suggest the gauge coupling unification to be interpreted in the context of the Ka{\v{c}}-Moody Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Open charm mesons in variational scheme and HQET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charm ($D$) and charm-strange ($D_s$) mesons are investigated in a variational scheme using Gaussian trial wave functions. The Hamiltonian contains Song and Lin potential with a constant term dependent on radial and orbital quantum numbers. The Gaussian wave function used has a dependence on radial distance $r$, radial quantum number $n$, orbital quantum number $l$ and a trial parameter $\mu$. These wave functions are used to compute the expectation of Song and Lin potential dependent on $r$. The total energy (expectation of Hamiltonian) for each state is minimized with a parameter $\mu$ from the wavefunctions. The obtained spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with other theoretical models and available experimental masses. The mass spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are also used to plot Regge trajectories in the ($J^P$, $M^2$) and ($n_r$, $M^2$) planes. In ($J^P$, $M^2$) plane, both natural and unnatural parity states of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are plotted. The trajectories are parallel and equidistant from each other. The two-body strong decays of $D$ and $D_s$ are analyzed in the framework of heavy quark effective theory using computed masses. The strong decay widths are given in terms of strong coupling constants. These couplings are also estimated by comparing them with available experimental values for observed states. Also, the partial decay width ratios of different states are analyzed and used to suggest assignments to the observed states. We have assigned the spin-parity to newly observed $D^*_{s2}(2573)$ as the strange partner of $D^*_2(2460)$ identified as $1^3P_2$, $D_1^*(2760)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2860)$ as $1^3D_1$, $D^*_3(2750)$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)$ as $1^3D_3$, $D_2(2740)$ as $1D_2$, $D_0(2550)$ as $2^1S_0$, $D^*_1(2660)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2700)$ as $2^3S_1$, $D^*_J(3000)$ as $2^3P_0$ $D_J(3000)$ as $2P_1$, $D^*_2(3000)$ as $1^3F_2$ states.</description>

      <title>Possible bound states of Heavy Baryonium and Heavy Dibaryon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the heavy baryonium and heavy dibaryon systems using the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder and instantaneous approximations for the kernel. Our results indicate that all the heavy baryonium systems, specifically $\Lambda_Q\bar{\Lambda}_Q$, $\Xi_Q\bar{\Xi}_Q$, $\Sigma_Q\bar{\Sigma}_Q$, $\Xi'_Q\bar{\Xi}'_Q$, and $\Omega_Q\bar{\Omega}_Q$ ($Q=c, b$), can form bound states. Among the heavy dibaryon systems, only the $\Xi_Q\Xi_Q$ system with $I=0$ and the $\Sigma_Q\Sigma_Q$ systems with $I=0$ and $I=1$ can exist as bound states. Additionally, the $\Sigma_Q\bar{\Sigma}_Q$ system with $I=2$ and the $\Sigma_Q\Sigma_Q$ system with $I=1$ are not deeply bound.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark bound and resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the energy spectrum of the S-wave doubly heavy tetraquark systems, including the $ QQ^{(\prime)}\bar q\bar q$, $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar s\bar q$, and $ QQ^{(\prime)}\bar s\bar s$ ($Q^{(\prime)}=b,c$ and $q=u,d$) systems within the constituent quark model. We use the complex scaling method to obtain bound states and resonant states simultaneously, and the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled four-body Schr\"odinger equation. With a novel definition of the root-mean-square radii, we are able to distinguish between meson molecules and compact tetraquark states. The compact tetraquarks are further classified into three different types with distinct spatial configurations: compact even tetraquarks, compact diquark-antidiquark tetraquarks and compact diquark-centered tetraquarks. In the $ I(J^P)=0(1^+) $ $QQ\bar q\bar q$ system, there exists the $ D^*D $ molecular bound state with a binding energy of $ -14 $ MeV, which is the candidate for $ T_{cc}(3875)^+ $. The shallow $\bar B^*\bar B$ molecular bound state is the bottom analogue of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. Moreover, we identify two resonant states near the $D^*D^*$ and $\bar B^*\bar B^*$ thresholds. In the $ J^P=1^+ $ $bb\bar q\bar q\,(I=0)$ and $bb\bar s\bar q$ systems, we obtain deeply bound states with a compact diquark-centered tetraquark configuration and a dominant $\chi_{\bar 3_c\otimes 3_c}$ component, along with resonant states with similar configurations as their radial excitations. These states are the QCD analogue of the helium atom. We also obtain some other bound states and resonant states with ``QCD Hydrogen molecule" configurations. Moreover, we investigate the heavy quark mass dependence of the $ I(J^P)=0(1^+) $ $ QQ\bar q\bar q $ bound states. We strongly urge the experimental search for the predicted states.</description>

      <title>Polarized and un-polarized $\mathcal{R}_{K^*}$ in and beyond the SM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) is lepton flavor universal, and the recent measurements of lepton flavor universality in $B \to (K,K^*)\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, for $\ell = \mu, \; e$, decays now lie close to the SM predictions. However, this is not the case for the $\tau$ to $\mu$ ratios in these decays, where there is still some window open for the new physics (NP), and to accommodate them various extensions to the SM are proposed. It will be interesting to identify some observables which are not only sensitive on the parametric space of such NP models but also have some discriminatory power. We find that the polarization of the $K^{*}$ may play an important role, therefore, we have computed the unpolarized and polarized lepton flavor universality ratios of $\tau$ to $\mu$ in $B\to K^{*}\ell^{+}\ell^{+}$, $\ell= \mu, \tau$ decays. The calculation shows that in most of the cases, the values of the various proposed observables fall within the current experimental sensitivity, and their study at some on going and future experiments will serve as a tool to segregate the variants of the NP models.</description>

      <title>Pion pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at next-to-leading order matched to Parton Shower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pion pair production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at flavour factories plays a crucial role in the determination of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The recent CMD-3 measurement of the pion form factor via energy scan displays a significant difference with the previous experimental determinations. In order to contribute to an improved theoretical description and simulation of energy scan experiments, we present a calculation of the $e^+ e^- \to \pi^+ \pi^- (\gamma)$ hadronic channel at next-to-leading order matched to a Parton Shower algorithm in QED and sQED. According to the recent advances in the literature, particular attention is paid to the treatment of the pion composite structure in loop diagrams beyond the commonly used factorised sQED approach, as well as to the modelling of multiple photon radiation through the Parton Shower algorithm. In particular, we carry out a detailed discussion on the inclusion of the pion form factor in the virtual sQED corrections according to two independent methods, inspired by the generalised vector meson dominance model and the dispersive approach. We show phenomenological results for inclusive and differential observables which are relevant for precision energy scan measurements, focusing on the impact of the radiative corrections and the effect of the various approaches for the treatment of the pion form factor. Our calculation is implemented in an updated version of the Monte Carlo event generator BabaYaga@NLO, that can be used for fully exclusive simulations in data analysis.</description>

      <title>NLO EW and QCD corrections to polarised same-sign WW scattering at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first calulation of same-sign WW scattering at the LHC in the fully leptonic decay channel including the modelling of polarisation for intermediate electroweak bosons and radiative corrections up to NLO EW+QCD accuracy. The predictions rely on a pole expansion and on the split of polarisation states at matrix-element level. Doubly-polarised and unpolarised signals are investigated together with full off-shell results. A detailed phenomenlogical analysis is carried out focusing on differential observables that discriminate between polarisation states, paving the way for refined polarisation-oriented analyses of vector-boson scattering with Run-3 LHC data.</description>

      <title>Relaxation times for disoriented isospin condensates in high energy heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations between charged and neutral kaons measured by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC exceed conventional explanations. Previously it was shown that if the scalar condensate is accompanied by an electrically neutral isospin--1 field then the combination can produce large equilibrium fluctuations where $\langle \bar{u}u\rangle \ne \langle \bar{d}d\rangle$. Hadronizing strange and anti-strange quarks might then strongly fluctuate between charged ($u\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{u}$) and neutral ($d\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{d}$) kaons. Here we estimate the times for the condensates to achieve their equilibrium probability distributions within causal volumes in high energy heavy ion collisions. This is achieved by modeling the temperature dependence of the condensates, mesonic collective excitations, decay rates of the associated fields, and employing the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. We find that the equilibration times are short compared with the expansion time, and therefore disoriented isospin condensates are a viable explanation for the anomalous fluctuations observed at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Limits and correlations of T and Z components of CPT-odd coefficients of the Standard Model Extension at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possible effect of the Standard Model Extension (SME) coefficient $(a_L)^Z$ in the neutrino propagation and discuss how this can affect DUNE limits on the coefficient $(a_L)^T$ found elsewhere. Based on an analysis that considers both coefficients, we find new constraints for them coming from DUNE. Furthermore, we investigate the correlations of the standard oscillation parameters, the leptonic $CP-$violating phase, $\delta_{CP}$, and the atmospheric mixing angle, $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$, with respect to the SME coefficients $(a_L)^T$ and $(a_L)^Z$.</description>

      <title>High Energy Physics from Low Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separation between physics at low and high energies is essential for physics to have any utility; the details of quantum gravity are not necessary to calculate the trajectory of a cannon ball. However, physics at low and high energies are not completely independent, and this thesis explores two ways that they are related. The first is through a UV/IR symmetry that relates scattering processes at low and high energies. This UV/IR symmetry manifests in geometrical properties of the $S$-matrix, and of the RG flow of the coupling constants in the corresponding effective field theory. Low energy nuclear physics nearly realizes this UV/IR symmetry, providing an explanation for the smallness of shape parameters in the effective range expansion of nucleon-nucleon scattering, and inspiring a new way to organize the interactions between neutrons and protons. The second is through the use of quantum computers to simulate lattice gauge theories. Quantum simulations rely on the universality of the rules of quantum mechanics, which can be applied equally well to describe a (low energy) transmon qubit at 15 milli-Kelvin as a (high energy) 1 TeV quark. This thesis presents the first simulations of one dimensional lattice quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer, culminating in a real-time simulation of beta-decay. Results from the first simulations of a lattice gauge theory on 100+ qubits of a quantum computer are also presented. The methods developed in this thesis for quantum simulation are ``physics-aware", and are guided by the symmetries and hierarchies in length scales of the systems being studied. Without these physics-aware methods, 100+ qubit simulations of lattice gauge theories would not have been possible on the noisy quantum computers that are presently available.</description>

      <title>Explicit Asymptotic Solutions of $\nu_e + e^-$ Neutrino Networks for Large Sets of Partial Differential Equations in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physics, accurately modeling large-scale phenomena such as core-collapse supernovae, (CCSN), and neutron star mergers are computationally challenging and require solving large sets of partial and ordinary differential equations. Traditional methods used widely in the scientific community are predominantly implicit, which are approximations that often require drastic simplifications and can be computationally inefficient. This thesis presents results on a new software suite titled "Fast Explicit Neutrino Networks" or "FENN", that introduces a suite of algebraically stabilized explicit methods known as explicit asymptotic for modeling Neutrino Electron Scattering, (NES), presenting a novel approach that combines the stability of traditional methods with enhanced computational efficiency. Initial results show that FENN can deliver accurate solutions for neutrino networks at improved computational speeds. This thesis further covers new results for scaled networks beyond the constraints of standard energy groupings, as well as the dynamics of neutrino interactions such as the scattering of various neutrino flavors -- electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$), electron anti-neutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$), and muon/tau neutrinos ($\nu_{\mu,\tau}$) as well as their anti-particles ($\bar{\nu}_{\mu,\tau}$) -- off electrons.</description>

      <title>Field Theory of Non-Newtonian Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing a compelling derivation of Kolmogorov turbulence is a fascinating open challenge in field theory. Here, we pose a more modest question: if we had a field-theoretic description of Kolmogorov turbulence, could we use it to describe deviations caused, for example, by adding a polymer additive or by relativistic corrections? To investigate this issue, we assume a description of developed, homogeneous, and isotropic turbulence along the lines of Martin, Siggia, and Rose, and we work out the first corrections to the equal-time, two-point spectrum caused by adding non-Newtonian terms to the fluid stress tensor. While the results are not conclusive, they show a promising resemblance to turbulent spectra found in both experiments and large-scale numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensate in a holographic dilute nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study chiral condensate in cold nuclear matter on the basis of holographic theory, which would be dual to a baryon system in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the confinement phase. Our model is a holographic model based on the D$3$/D$7$ branes. The magnitude of the chiral condensate obtained in our model is found to gradually increase with increasing baryon density $n$ within the range of the dilute nucleon gas, $n&lt;1$, where our model is available. This is a result for the chiral condensate in the holographic model as a function of $n$, which can be compared to the chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the temperatures which characterise the Unruh effect, the Gibbons-Hawking radiation from the de Sitter cosmological horizon and the Hawking radiation from the black hole horizon acquire the extra factor 2 compared with their traditional values. The reason for that is the coherence of different processes. The combination of the coherent processes also allows us to make the connection between the Schwinger pair production and the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings, metastable strings and ultralight primordial black holes: from NANOGrav to LIGO and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While topologically stable cosmic strings are disfavored by the recent observation of nHz stochastic gravitational waves (GW) by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), e.g., NANOGrav, cosmic metastable strings and superstrings are not. However, because the gravitational waves from all classes of strings generally span a wide range of frequencies, they contradict LIGO's non-observation of stochastic gravitational waves at the $f\sim $ 25 Hz band for a substantial string-parameter space favoured by the PTA data. Suppose ultralight primordial black holes ($M_{BH}&lt;10^9$ g) existed in the early universe. In this case, they reduce the amplitude of the GWs at higher frequencies by providing an early matter-dominated phase, alleviating the tension between LIGO observation and PTA data. We show that the recent PTA data complemented by future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) runs plus detectors such as LISA and ET would be able to dapple the properties and further search strategies of such ultralight primordial black holes which are otherwise fairly elusive as they evaporate in the early universe by Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD extraction of the $\eta_{c}$-meson $t$-dependent parton distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of short-distance factorization, conveyed through the pseudo-distribution approach, connects space-like and light-cone correlators and thus allows for the extraction in lattice QCD of a number of parton distributions. We compute the $t$-dependent parton distribution function of valence quarks in a $\eta_{c}$-meson. After reviewing the main ideas behind the pseudo-distribution formalism, and relying on the analytic structure of Ioffe-time distributions, we come up with a proposal for a model-independent extraction of $t$-dependent parton distribution functions. We present results for the $\eta_{c}$-meson Ioffe time valence $t$-dependent parton distribution function at a renormalization scale of $3~\textrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring neutrino interactions in light of present and upcoming galaxy survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard cosmological framework, neutrinos begin to free-stream after the weak interaction phase ends in the early universe, at a temperature of approximately $T \sim 1 \, {\rm MeV}$. However, the onset of neutrino free-streaming can be delayed if additional interactions occur in the early universe, leaving imprints on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) angular power spectra and the large-scale structure (LSS) matter power spectra. We present a thorough analysis of early universe neutrino interactions with a fairly generalized parameterization of the interaction rates as a power law in neutrino temperature. In this (6+2) parameter scenario, we constrain the cosmological parameters along with the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass in presence of such interactions, with the help of full shape (FS) galaxy power spectra from BOSS Data Release 12. Our analysis reveals that a combined dataset of FS along with CMB and BAO offers improved constraints on the free-streaming redshift from present data, comparable to the forecast results from future CMB-S4 data. Additionally, we investigate the prospects of future galaxy surveys by forecasting on Euclid mission in combination with Planck and CMB-S4, and find significant improvement on both the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass than the existing constraints as well as than CMB-S4 alone.</description>

      <title>Final State Gluon Emission in Deep-Inelastic Scattering at Next-to-Leading Twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.05329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed reanalysis of the single gluon emission rate at next-to-leading twist is carried out. As was the case in prior efforts, the problem is cast in the framework of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) of an electron off a large nucleus. The quark produced in the interaction propagates through the remaining nucleus and engenders scattering and gluon radiation, which is calculated in the limit of one re-scattering. This medium induced single gluon emission rate forms the basis of several energy loss calculations in both DIS and heavy-ion collisions. Unlike prior efforts, a complete transverse momentum gradient expansion of the hadronic tensor, including $N_c$ suppressed terms, phase terms and finite gluon momentum fraction terms, ignored previously, is carried out. These terms turn out to be surprisingly large. In contrast to prior efforts, the full next-to-leading twist gluon emission kernel is found to be positive definite and slowly increasing with the exchanged transverse momentum. Phenomenological consequences of these new contributions are discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility to populate the dark sector through a phase transition. We will consider secluded dark sectors made of gauge theories, Randall-Sundrum scenarios and conformally coupled elementary particles. These sectors have in common the fact that the action is approximately Weyl invariant, implying that particle production due to time dependent background is strongly suppressed. In particular no significant production takes place during inflation allowing to avoid strong isocurvature constraints from CMB. As we will show, if the scale of inflation is large compared to the dynamical mass scale, these sectors automatically undergo a phase transition that in the simplest cases is controlled by the Hubble parameter. If the phase transition takes place during reheating or radiation the abundance obtained can be larger than particle production and production from the SM plasma. For phase transitions completing during radiation domination, the DM mass is predicted in the range $10^8$ GeV while larger values are required for phase transitions occurring during reheating.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the quark mass dependence - light and heavy - of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ properties, such as, mass, coupling to $DK$, scattering lengths and compositeness, from a global analysis of $DK$ energy levels from LQCD. In particular, we analyze the HSC energy levels for $DK$ scattering in $I=0$ for different boosts and two pion masses. The formalism is based in the local hidden-gauge interaction of Weinberg-Tomozawa type which respects chiral and heavy quark spin symmetries, supplemented by a term that takes into account the $D^{(*)}K$ coupling to a bare $c\bar{s}$ component. The isospin violating decay of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)\to D_{s}^+\pi^0$ is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Light long-lived particles at the FCC-hh with the proposal for a dedicated forward detector FOREHUNT and a transverse detector DELIGHT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dedicated forward detector, FOREHUNT (FORward~Experiment~for~HUNdred~TeV), for 100 TeV FCC-hh for the detection of light long-lived particles (LLP) coming from $B$-meson decay. We calculate the signal acceptance as a function of mass and proper decay length of the LLP for 100 TeV and interpret our result in terms of model parameters for models of dark Higgs scalar and heavy neutral leptons. We also compare the sensitivity with proposed transverse detectors like MATHUSLA, CODEX-b for HL-LHC, and DELIGHT (Detector for long-lived particles at high energy of 100 TeV) for FCC-hh. Our analysis reveals that if the LLP is light ($\lesssim 4.4$ GeV) and has a low proper decay length ($&lt;10$ m), a forward detector like FOREHUNT is the best option to look for the decaying LLP, while DELIGHT is preferable for higher proper decay lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The library provides a set of C++/Python functions for computing cross sections of ultraperipheral collisions of high energy particles under the equivalent photons approximation. Cross sections are represented through multiple integrals over the phase space. The integrals are calculated through recurrent application of algorithms for one dimensional integration. The paper contains an introduction to the theory of ultraperipheral collisions, discusses the library approach and provides a few examples of calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing exotic $J^{PC}$ resonances from deeply bound charmoniumlike molecules: Insights for identifying exotic hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the resonance phenomenon in deeply bound charmoniumlike states. By interpreting the $Y(4220)$, $Y(4360)$, and $\psi(4415)$ states as deeply $S$-wave bound $D \bar D_1$, $D^* \bar D_1$, and $D^* \bar D_2^*$ molecules, respectively, we robustly predict the existence of $4$ $S$-wave deeply bound $C$-parity partner states and $13$ $P$-wave charmoniumlike molecular resonances. These states, formed by exchanging the light mesons and pinpointed through the complex scaling method, include $3$ $S$-wave bound states with exotic quantum numbers $I(J^{PC})$= $0(1^{-+})$ and $5$ $P$-wave resonances with exotic $0(0^{-+})$ and $0(2^{+-})$. We expect future experiments to search for such exotic molecular resonances, which will not only enrich the ongoing construction of ``Particle Zoo 2.0" but also help to scrutinize the hadronic molecular assignments of the $Y$-family particles including the $Y(4220)$, $Y(4360)$, and $\psi(4415)$ states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The juxtaposition of the precision of lepton flavour measurements and the limited energy range of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to discover dynamical degrees of freedom linked to the generation of the observed lepton mass patterns naively suggests only a limited relevance of the LHC's high luminosity phase. This, potentially, extends to future colliders. Using the concrete example of the type-II seesaw model and its effective field theory extension, we show that blind directions create a rich phenomenological interplay of muon precision measurements and electroweak resonance searches at present and future colliders, with testable implications for the HL-LHC phase.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Fermionic Dark Matter Absorption with Nucleon Fermi Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the incoherent regime of the fermionic dark matter absorption by nuclei using the relativistic Fermi gas model and nuclear form factors. With the momentum transfer being roughly equal to the dark matter mass $m_\chi$, the incoherent regime contributes significantly to the absorption process for $m_\chi \gtrsim 100$\,MeV with a spin-independent operator and for even smaller mass with a spin-dependent one. We also compare the situations for various target nuclei ($^{131}$Xe, $^{72}$Ge, $^{40}$Ar, $^{20}$Ne and $^4$He) that are typically used in the dark matter direct detection. A heavier nucleus actually has the advantage of probing the incoherent scattering of the fermionic absorption dark matter. Observing both the coherent and incoherent contributions would be an important justification of the fermionic dark matter absorption.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology: large-temperature behaviour and bounds from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a transparent discussion of the high temperature asymptotic behaviour of Cosmology in a dilaton-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (dEGB) scenario of modified gravity with vanishing scalar potential. In particular, we show that it has a clear interpretation in terms of only three attractors (stable critical points) of a set of autonomous differential equations: $w=-\frac{1}{3}$, $w=1$ and $1&lt;w&lt;\frac{7}{3}$, where $w\equiv p/\rho$ is the equation of state, defined as the ratio of the total pressure and the total energy density. All the possible different high-temperature evolution histories of the model are exhausted by only eight paths in the flow of the set of the autonomous differential equations. Our discussion clearly explains why five out of them are characterized by a swift transition of the system toward the attractor, while the remaining three show a more convoluted evolution, where the system follows a meta-stable equation of state at intermediate temperatures before eventually jumping to the real attractor at higher temperatures. Compared to standard Cosmology, the regions of the dEGB parameter space with $w=-\frac{1}{3}$ show a strong enhancement of the expected Gravitational Wave stochastic background produced by the primordial plasma of relativistic particles of the Standard Model. This is due to the very peculiar fact that dEGB allows to have an epoch when the energy density $\rho_{\rm rad}$ of the relativistic plasma dominates the energy of the Universe while at the same time the rate of dilution with $T$ of the total energy density is slower than what usually expected during radiation dominance. This allows to use the bound from BBN to put in dEGB a constraint $T_{\rm RH}\lesssim 10^8 - 10^9$ GeV on the reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm RH}$. Such BBN bound is complementary to late-time constraints from compact binary mergers.</description>

      <title>On the Metastability of Quantum Fields in Thermal Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the metastability of scalar fields in quantum field theories at finite temperature, focusing on a detailed understanding of the bounce solution. At finite temperature, the bounce solution depends on two variables: the Euclidean time $\tau$ and the spatial radial distance $r$, and it is periodic in the $\tau$ direction. We propose a novel method to determine the bounce that describes transitions in a thermal bath, suitable for numerical calculations. Two types of bounces exist for transitions in the thermal bath: $\tau$-dependent and $\tau$-independent bounces. We apply our method to compute these bounces in several models, including both thin-wall and thick-wall scenarios, to examine their properties. Specifically, we evaluate the critical temperature below which the $\tau$-independent bounce becomes destabilized due to fluctuations, rendering it irrelevant. We demonstrate that in the thick-wall case, the $\tau$-dependent bounce smoothly transitions into the $\tau$-independent one as temperature increases, whereas in the thin-wall case, the transition between the two types of bounces is discontinuous.</description>

      <title>QCD Masterclass Lectures on Jet Physics and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lectures were presented at the 2024 QCD Masterclass in Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, France. They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including $H\to b\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one-versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.</description>

      <title>The Fox-Wolfram Moment of jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical investigation of Fox-Wolfram moments (FWMs) for multi-jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this work, jet productions in p+p collisions are computed with a Monte Carlo event generator SHERPA, while the Linear Boltzmann Transport model is utilized to simulate the multiple scattering of energetic partons in the hot and dense QCD matter. The event-normalized distributions of the lower-order FWM, $H_1^T$ in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions are calculated. It is found that for events with jet number $n_\text{jet} = 2$ the $H_1^T$ distribution in Pb+Pb is suppressed at small $H_1^T$ while enhanced at large $H_1^T$ region as compared to p+p. For events with $n_\text{jet}&gt;2$, the jet number reduction effect due to jet quenching in the QGP decreases the $H_1^T$ distribution at large $H_1^T$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p. The medium modification of the Fox-Wolfram moment $H_1^T$ for events with $n_\text{jet}\ge 2$ are also presented, which resemble those of events with $n_\text{jet} = 2$. Its reason is revealed through the relative contribution fractions of events with different final-state jet numbers to $H_1^T$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic responses of a non-extensive quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the non-extensive statistical mechanics and the gluon polarization tensor obtained from kinetic theory, we derive the longitudinal and transverse gluon self-energies for the quark-gluon plasma. The electric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and the magnetic permeability $\mu_M$ are evaluated from the gluon self-energies through which the real part of the square of the refraction index ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ are investigated. The real part of $\varepsilon$ displays a frequency pole $\omega_d=p$, which is just the position of the frequency inflexion of the imaginary part of $\varepsilon$. The non-extensive parameter $q$ significantly affects the real and imaginary parts of $\varepsilon$ in the space-like region $\omega&lt;p$, while the frequency pole $\omega_d=p$ remains unchanged as $q$ increases. The magnetic permeability, ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ diverge at frequency $\omega_m$. As $q$ increases, the pole frequency $\omega_m$ shifts to large frequency region. The Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ becomes negative in a quite large frequency region $\omega\in[\omega_c, \omega_m]$. When $q$ increases, the frequency range for $n_{DL}&lt;0$ becomes wider. Nevertheless, there are no propagating modes for the negative refraction. In addition, as momentum $p$ increases, the electric permittivity, the magnetic permeability, ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and $n_{DL}$ are sensitive to the change of $p$, which indicates the importance of the spatial dispersion in the electromagnetic responses of the QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MUonE experiment aims to extract the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment from a precise measurement of the muon-electron differential scattering cross section. We show that MUonE can also discover thermal relic dark matter using only its nominal experimental setup. Our search strategy is sensitive to models of dark matter in which pairs of pseudo-Dirac fermions are produced in muon-nucleus scattering in the target, and the heavier state decays semi-visibly to yield dilepton pairs displaced downstream from the interaction point. This approach can probe sub-GeV thermal-relic dark matter whose cosmological abundance is governed by the same model parameters that set the MUonE signal strength. Furthermore, our results show that the downstream ECAL plays a key role in rejecting backgrounds for this search, thereby providing strong motivation for the MUonE to keep this component in the final experimental design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing a Higgs-Dilaton potential, the 2T model has full triggering for a first order electroweak phase transition, namely for the mass of Dilaton between $300 $ GeV and $550$ GeV. We have also compared the transition strengths in the case with and without daisay loops, the difference being always less than $0.2$. The effective Higgs potential has given a sphaleron energy less than $8.4$ TeV. The value of $\beta/H^*$ is larger than $25$ and less than $34$ in all cases that are sufficient to trigger the first order electroweak phase transition. Gravitational wave energy density caused by this transition, may be sufficiently detected by future detectors, could indirectly confirm Dilaton.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-covariant spinor wave packet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for a manifestly Lorentz-covariant spinor wave-packet basis. The traditional definition of the spinor wave packet is problematic due to its unavoidable mixing with other wave packets under Lorentz transformations. Our approach resolves this inherent mixing issue. The wave packet we develop constitutes a complete set, enabling the expansion of a free spinor field while maintaining Lorentz covariance. Additionally, we present a Lorentz-invariant expression for zero-point energy.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration -- Contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of autonomous radio-detection units to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to discover them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Presently, three prototype GRAND radio arrays are in operation: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nancay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the design of the radio-detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a look at the first data collected by GRANDProto13, the first phase of GRANDProto300.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravity waves from ultra slow-roll Galileon inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the production of secondary gravity waves in Galileon inflation with an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase and show that the spectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in this case is consistent with the recent NANOGrav 15-year data and with sensitivities of other ground and space-based missions, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, ET, HLVK (consists of aLIGO, aVirgo, and KAGRA), and HLV(03). Thanks to the non-renormalization property of Galileon theory, the amplitude of the large fluctuation is controllable at the sharp transitions between SR and USR regions. We show that the behaviour of the GW spectrum, when one-loop effects are included in the scalar power spectrum, is preserved under a shift of the sharp transition scale with peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$, and hence it can cover a wide range of frequencies within ${\cal O}(10^{-9}{\rm Hz} - 10^{7}{\rm Hz})$. An analysis of the allowed mass range for primordial black holes (PBHs) is also performed, where we find that mass values ranging from ${\cal O}(1M_{\odot} - 10^{-18}M_{\odot})$ can be generated over the corresponding allowed range of low and high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Kink Entanglement Asymmetry on a Quantum Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement, it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables. We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables, either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the tensor bispectrum mediated by an excited scalar field during inflation and find that the bispectrum peaks in the squeezed configuration, which is different from that of gravitational waves induced by enhanced curvature perturbations re-entering the horizon in the radiation-dominated era. Measuring the bispectrum provides a promising way to distinguish the stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during inflation from that generated after inflation.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive CMB data analysis of cosmological collider physics. New heavy particles during inflation can leave imprints in the primordial correlators which are observable in today's cosmological surveys. This remarkable detection channel provides an unsurpassed opportunity to probe new physics at extremely high energies. Here we initiate the search for these relic signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck legacy release. On the theory side, guided by recent progress from the cosmological bootstrap, we first propose a family of analytic bispectrum templates that incorporate the distinctive signatures of cosmological collider physics. Our consideration includes the oscillatory signals in the squeezed limit, the angular dependence from spinning fields, and several new shapes from nontrivial sound speed effects. On the observational side, we apply the recently developed pipeline, CMB Bispectrum Estimator (CMB-BEST), to efficiently analyze the three-point statistics and search directly for these new templates in the Planck 2018 temperature and polarization data. We report stringent CMB constraints on these new templates. Furthermore, we perform parameter scans to search for the best-fit values with maximum significance. For a benchmark example of collider templates, we find $f_{NL}=-91\pm40$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the biggest adjusted significance we get is $1.8\sigma$. In general, we find no significant evidence of cosmological collider signals in the Planck data. However, this innovative analysis demonstrates the potential for discovering new heavy particles during inflation in forthcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Reionization after JWST: a photon budget crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations are revealing the first galaxies to be prolific producers of ionizing photons, which we argue gives rise to a tension between different probes of reionization. Over the last two decades a consensus has emerged where star-forming galaxies are able to generate enough photons to drive reionization, given reasonable values for their number densities, ionizing efficiencies $\xi_{\rm ion}$ (per unit UV luminosity), and escape fractions $f_{\rm esc}$. However, some new JWST observations infer high values of $\xi_{\rm ion}$ during reionization and an enhanced abundance of earlier ($z\gtrsim 9$) galaxies, dramatically increasing the number of ionizing photons produced at high $z$. Simultaneously, recent low-$z$ studies predict significant escape fractions for faint reionization-era galaxies. Put together, we show that the galaxies we have directly observed ($M_{\rm UV} &lt; -15$) not only can drive reionization, but would end it too early. That is, our current galaxy observations, taken at face value, imply an excess of ionizing photons and thus a process of reionization in tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Considering galaxies down to $M_{\rm UV}\approx -11$, below current observational limits, only worsens this tension. We discuss possible avenues to resolve this photon budget crisis, including systematics in either theory or observations.</description>

      <title>Data reconstruction of the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ Hubble data and Gaussian Processes in order to reconstruct the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology beyond the coincident gauge. In particular, there exist three branches of connections that satisfy the torsionless and curvatureless conditions, parameterized by a new dynamical function $\gamma$. We express the redshift dependence of $\gamma$ in terms of the $H(z)$ function and the $f(Q)$ form and parameters, and then we reconstruct it using 55 $H(z)$ observation data. Firstly, we investigate the case where ordinary conservation law holds, and we reconstruct the $f(Q)$ function, which is very well described by a quadratic correction on top of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. Proceeding to the general case, we consider two of the most studied $f(Q)$ models of the literature, namely the square-root and the exponential one. In both cases we reconstruct $\gamma(z)$, and we show that according to AIC and BIC information criteria its inclusion is favoured compared to both $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, as well as to the same $f(Q)$ models under the coincident gauge. This feature acts as an indication that $f(Q)$ cosmology should be studied beyond the coincident gauge.</description>

      <title>Global Data-Driven Determination of Baryon Transition Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic resonances emerge from strong interactions encoding the dynamics of quarks and gluons. The structure of these resonances can be probed by virtual photons parameterized in transition form factors. In this study, twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ transition form factors at the pole are extracted from data with the center-of-mass energy from $\pi N$ threshold to $1.8\,{\rm GeV}$, and the photon virtuality $0\leq Q^2/{\rm GeV}^2\leq 8$. For the first time, these results are determined from a simultaneous analysis of more than one state, i.e., $\sim 10^5$ $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ electroproduction data. In addition, about $ 5\cdot 10^4$ data in the hadronic sector as well as photoproduction serve as boundary conditions. For the $\Delta(1232)$ and $N(1440)$ states our results are in qualitative agreement with previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the first time. Realistic uncertainties are determined by further exploring the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid-turn slow-roll inflationary trajectories have been shown to be an attractor in two-field models, provided the turn rate is near constant and larger than the slow-roll parameters. These trajectories can produce primordial spectra consistent with current observations on CMB scales. We present the generalized consistency condition for sustained rapid-turn inflationary trajectory with two fields, arbitrary field-space metric and potential valid for any value of the turn rate. This has to be supplemented by a second condition to ensure slow roll evolution. Both conditions together constitute a tool to identify inflationary trajectories with arbitrary values of the turning rate without having to solve the equations of motion. We present a Python package for the numerical identification of regions in field-space and parameter space that allow for rapid-turn trajectories.</description>

      <title>Flavor Dependence of Charged Pion Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have measured the flavor dependence of multiplicities for pi^+ and pi^- production in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on proton and deuteron targets to explore a possible charge symmetry violation in fragmentation functions. The experiment used an electron beam with energies of 10.2 and 10.6 GeV at Jefferson Lab and the Hall-C spectrometers. The electron kinematics spanned the range 0.3&lt;x&lt;0.6, 2&lt;Q^2&lt;5.5 GeV^2, and 4&lt;W^2&lt;11 GeV^2. The pion fractional momentum range was 0.3&lt; z &lt;0.7, and the transverse momentum range was 0&lt;p_T&lt;0.25 GeV/c. Assuming factorization at low p_T and allowing for isospin breaking, we find that the results can be described by two "favored" and two "un-favored" effective low $p_T$ fragmentation functions that are flavor-dependent. However, they converge to a common flavor-independent value at the lowest x or highest W of this experiment.</description>
