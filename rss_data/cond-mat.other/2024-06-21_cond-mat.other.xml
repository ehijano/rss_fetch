      <title>Competition of vortex core structures in superfluid $^3$He-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among vortex structures identified so far in superfluid $^3$He-B, the most common are the A-phase-core vortex and the double-core vortex. According to earlier numerical calculations, the double-core vortex is energetically favored nearly everywhere in the $p$-$T$ phase diagram. Nevertheless, in experiments the A-phase-core vortex has been observed down to temperatures of $0.6T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at high pressures. We use the Ginzburg-Landau formalism to calculate the energies of the two vortex structures in the experimentally relevant magnetic field as well as the energy barrier for the transition between the two structures. Assigning vanishing barrier as the boundary of the metastability region of the A-phase-core vortex, we reproduce the experimentally measured vortex phase diagram and provide an explanation for the reappearance of the double-core vortex near the critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at low pressures: The difference in Zeeman energy between the two vortex structures becomes relatively more important close to $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, and the A-phase-core vortex becomes unstable. In contrast to the equilibrium vortex structures, we suggest that the vortex nucleation process favors the A-phase-core vortex over the double-core vortex. Our approach can be used to analyze competition between different vortex structures in other unconventional superfluids and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Andreev reflection to the mobility of surface state electrons on superfluid $^3$He-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mobility of the Wigner solid on the superfluid $^3$He is determined by the momentum transfer from the scattered $^3$He quasiparticles at the free surface. The scattering process of the quasiparticles is classified into the normal reflection and the Andreev retroreflection. Since the quasiparticles nearly conserve the momentum in the process of the Andreev retroreflection at the free surface, the Andreev reflected quasiparticles do not produce a resistive force to the Wigner solid. In this report, we have analytically calculated the contribution of the Andreev retroreflection to the mobility of the Wigner solid on superfluid $^3$He-B by employing a realistic model order parameter with the free surface. The Andreev retroreflection is lacked for quasiparticles with energy above the bulk energy gap under the model order parameter. Then, the Andreev retroreflection does not contribute to a rise in the mobility of the Wigner solid on the superfluid $^3$He-B. The present model calculation is in good agreement with the previous experimental observation. We have also discussed the Andreev retroreflection under a self-consistently calculated order parameter.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, there have been multiple proposals for potential coherent sources of photons, but a well established candidate is still missing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a new design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. The scheme is based on initiating a population inversion in a superconducting circuit that will act as the photon source of one or multiple target resonators. The key novelty of the proposed layout consists in replacing the usual capacitive link between the source and the target cavity with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of having on-demand control on the injected steady-state photons. We validate the dynamical control of the generated coherent states under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic breathing dromion-like structures in an anisotropic ferromagnetic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of Gilbert damping on the propagation of electromagnetic waves (EMWs) in an anisotropic ferromagnetic medium is investigated theoretically. The interaction of the magnetic field component of the electromagnetic wave with the magnetization of a ferromagnetic medium has been studied by solving the associated Maxwell's equations coupled with a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. When small perturbations are made on the magnetization of the ferromagnetic medium and magnetic field along the direction of propagation of electromagnetic wave by using the reductive perturbation method, the associated nonlinear dynamics is governed by a time-dependent damped derivative nonlinear Schrodinger (TDDNLS) equation. The Lagrangian density function is constructed by using the variational method to solve the TDDNLS equation to understand the dynamics of the system under consideration. The propagation of EMW in a ferromagnetic medium with inherent Gilbert damping admits very interesting nonlinear dynamical structures. These structures include Gilbert damping-managing symmetrically breathing solitons, localized erupting electromagnetic breathing dromion-like modes of excitations, breathing dromion-like soliton, decaying dromion-like modes and an unexpected creation-annihilation mode of excitations in the form of growing-decaying dromion-like modes.</description>

      <title>Topological Unwinding in an Exciton-Polariton Condensate Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase distribution in a Bose-Einstein condensate can realize various topological states classified by distinct winding numbers. While states with different winding numbers are topologically protected in the linear Schr\"odinger equation, when nonlinearities are introduced, violations of the topological protection can occur, leading to unwinding. Exciton-polariton condensates constitute a nonlinear open-dissipative system that is well suited to studying such physics. Here we show that a one-dimensional array of exciton-polariton condensates displays a spontaneous phase unwinding from a $\pi$- to zero-state. We clarify that this collective mode transition is caused by the combined effect of nonlinearity and topological defects in the condensates. While the mode-switching phenomenon observed in our previous experiment was interpreted as the single-particle mode competition, we offer an alternative explanation in terms the collective phase unwinding and find its evidence by reanalyzing the experimental data. Our results open a route towards active control of the mode switching by manipulating the topological defects in prospective quantum polaritonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational scheme to represent composite quantum systems using multiple parameterized functions of varying accuracies on both classical and quantum hardware. The approach follows the variational principle over the entire system, and is naturally suited for scenarios where an accurate description is only needed in a smaller subspace. We show how to include quantum devices as high-accuracy solvers on these correlated degrees of freedom, while handling the remaining contributions with a classical device. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol on spin chains and small molecules and provide insights into its accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic perturbation theory for two-component systems with one heavy component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory with respect to the kinetic energy of the heavy component of a two-component quantum system is introduced. An effective Hamiltonian that is accurate to second order in the inverse heavy mass is derived. It contains a new form of kinetic energy operator with a Hermitian mass tensor and a complex-valued vector potential. All of the potentials in the effective Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of covariant derivatives and a resolvent operator. The most salient application of the theory is to systems of electrons and nuclei. The accuracy of the theory is verified numerically in a model diatomic molecule and analytically in a vibronic coupling model.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Approximation and Aharonov-Casher Bands in Twisted Homobilayer TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been identified in homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the position-dependence of the layer spinor with a nonuniform periodic effective magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy. As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature distribution.</description>

      <title>Mobility and Threshold Voltage Extraction in Transistors with Gate-Voltage-Dependent Contact Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mobility of emerging (e.g., two-dimensional, oxide, organic) semiconductors is commonly estimated from transistor current-voltage measurements. However, such devices often experience contact gating, i.e., electric fields from the gate modulate the contact resistance during measurements, which can lead conventional extraction techniques to estimate mobility incorrectly even by a factor &gt;2. This error can be minimized by measuring transistors at high gate-source bias, |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, but this regime is often inaccessible in emerging devices that suffer from high contact resistance or early gate dielectric breakdown. Here, we propose a method of extracting mobility in transistors with gate-dependent contact resistance that does not require operation at high |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, enabling accurate mobility extraction even in emerging transistors with strong contact gating. Our approach relies on updating the transfer length method (TLM) and can achieve &lt;10% error even in regimes where conventional techniques overestimate mobility by &gt;2$\times$.</description>
