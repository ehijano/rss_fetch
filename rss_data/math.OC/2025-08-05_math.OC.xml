      <title>Prime Factorization Equation from a Tensor Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an exact and explicit equation for prime factorization, along with an algorithm for its computation. The proposed method is based on the MeLoCoToN approach, which addresses combinatorial optimization problems through classical tensor networks. The presented tensor network performs the multiplication of every pair of possible input numbers and selects those whose product is the number to be factorized. Additionally, in order to make the algorithm more efficient, the number and dimension of the tensors and their contraction scheme are optimized. Finally, a series of tests on the algorithm are conducted, contracting the tensor network both exactly and approximately using tensor train compression, and evaluating its performance.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fleet Upgrade Decisions with Machine-Learning Enhanced Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet management.</description>

      <title>Periodic Fractional Control in Bioprocesses for Clean Water and Ecosystem Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel fractional-order chemostat model (FOCM) for optimizing biological water treatment processes, incorporating memory effects through the use of Caputo fractional derivative with sliding memory (CFDS). Traditional integer-order models fail to capture the time-dependent behaviors and memory effects inherent in microbial systems. Our work addresses this limitation by developing a fractional-order framework that represents microbial growth and substrate degradation dynamics more accurately. The primary objective is to minimize the average pollutant concentration in treated water through optimal periodic control (OPC) of the dilution rate, subject to constraints on treatment capacity and periodic boundary conditions. Key contributions include: (1) reduction of the 2D fractional-order system to a computationally tractable 1D fractional differential equation while preserving essential dynamics; (2) rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of optimal periodic solutions using Schauder's fixed-point theorem and convexity arguments; (3) derivation of bang-bang optimal control (OC) strategies by using a fractional Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP); and (4) comprehensive numerical simulations demonstrating significant performance improvements over steady-state operation. Our results show that periodic fractional control can reduce average substrate concentrations by up to 40% compared to steady-state operation, with the fractional order {\alpha}, the dynamic scaling parameter $\vartheta$, and the sliding memory length L serving as critical factors that govern memory effects, control responsiveness, and switching frequency. The proposed framework bridges fractional calculus with environmental engineering, offering new insights for designing sustainable water treatment systems with improved pollutant removal efficiency.</description>

      <title>Service Time Window Design in Last-Mile Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study focuses on designing reliable service time windows for customers in a last-mile delivery system to boost dependability and enhance customer satisfaction. To construct time windows for a pre-determined route (e.g., provided by commercial routing software), we introduce two criteria that balance window length and the risk of violation. The service provider can allocate different penalties reflecting risk tolerances to each criterion, resulting in various time windows with varying levels of service guarantee. Depending on the degree of information available about the travel time distribution, we develop two modeling frameworks based on stochastic and distributionally robust optimization. In each setting, we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal time windows, which are functions of risk preferences and the sequence of visits. We further investigate fixed-width time windows, which standardize service intervals, and the use of a policy that allows vehicles arriving before the lower bounds to wait rather than incur a penalty. Next, we integrate service time window design with routing optimization into a unified framework that simultaneously determines optimal routing and time window allocations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our models on a rich collection of instances from well-known datasets. While a small portion of the time windows designed by the stochastic model was violated in out-of-sample tests, the distributionally robust model consistently delivered routes and time windows within the service provider's risk tolerance. Our proposed frameworks are readily compatible with existing routing solutions, enabling service providers to design time windows aligned with their risk preferences. It can also be leveraged to produce the most efficient routes with narrow time windows that meet operational constraints at controlled levels of service guarantee.</description>

      <title>Quotients of Invariant Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work it was shown that if a control system $\mathcal{V}\subset TM$ on manifold $M$ has a control symmetry group $G$ then it very often has group quotients (or symmetry reductions) $\mathcal{V}/G$ which are static feedback linearizable (SFL). This, in turn, can be applied to systematically construct dynamic feedback linearizations of $\mathcal{V}$; or to construct partial feedback linearizations, when no dynamic feedback linearization exists. Because of these and related applications, this paper makes a detailed study of symmetry reduction for control systems. We show that a key property involved in the symmetry reduction of control systems is that of transversality of Lie group actions. Generalizing this notion, we provide an analysis of how the geometry of an invariant distribution, and particularly a control system, is altered as a consequence of symmetry reduction. This provides important information toward understanding the unexpectedly frequent occurrence of SFL quotients. Specifically, we detail how the integrability properties and ranks of various canonical sub-bundles of the quotient object differ from those of the given distribution. As a consequence we are able to classify the SFL quotients of $G$-invariant control systems $\mathcal{V}$ based upon the geometric properties of $\mathcal{V}$ and the action $G$. Additionally, we prove that static feedback linearizability is preserved by symmetry reduction and the well-known Sluis-Gardner-Shadwick (S-G-S) test for the static feedback linearization of control systems is extended to Goursat bundles. A generalized S-G-S test to identify if $\mathcal{V}/G$ is a Goursat bundle is also given, based on the Lie algebra of $G$. Finally, we apply all our results to the well-known PVTOL control system and demonstrate that it may be viewed as an invariant control system on a certain 9-dimensional Lie group.</description>

      <title>Benders Decomposition using Graph Modeling and Multi-Parametric Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benders decomposition is a widely used method for solving large optimization problems, but its performance is often hindered by the repeated solution of subproblems. We propose a flexible and modular algorithmic framework for accelerating Benders decomposition by embedding multi-parametric programming (mp) surrogates for optimization subproblems. Our approach leverages the OptiGraph abstraction in Plasmo$.$jl to model and decompose graph-structured problems. By solving the subproblems associated with the graph nodes once using mp, we can extract explicit piecewise affine mappings for primal and dual variables which replace the expensive subproblem solves with efficient look-ups and function evaluations during the iterative Benders process. We formally show the equivalence between classical Benders cuts and those derived from the mp solution and implement this integration in the open-source PlasmoBenders$.$jl software package. We apply it to a two-stage stochastic programming problem, which aims to make optimal capacity expansion decisions under uncertainty in product demand/prices and availability of raw materials. We evaluate single-cut and multi-cut variants of Benders and show that the mp surrogate approach achieves substantial speedups in subproblem solve time while preserving the convergence guarantees of Benders. Furthermore, we highlight advantages in the solution analysis and interpretability that is enabled by mp critical region tracking. Our results demonstrate that combining mp programming with graph modeling offers a promising and extensible foundation for structure-exploiting decomposition. By decomposing the problem into tractable subproblems, the proposed approach also aims to overcome scalability issues of mp, and the use of mp surrogates provides a unifying modeling framework to represent heterogeneous graph subproblems as common modeling objects.</description>

      <title>Sliced Optimal Transport Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the Sliced Wasserstein distance in the literature, its simplicity and efficiency have made it one of the most interesting surrogate for the Wasserstein distance in image processing and machine learning. However, its inability to produce transport plans limits its practical use to applications where only a distance is necessary. Several heuristics have been proposed in the recent years to address this limitation when the probability measures are discrete. In this paper, we propose to study these different propositions by redefining and analysing them rigorously for generic probability measures. Leveraging the $\nu$-based Wasserstein distance and generalised geodesics, we introduce and study the Pivot Sliced Discrepancy, inspired by a recent work by Mahey et al.. We demonstrate its semi-metric properties and its relation to a constrained Kantorovich formulation. In the same way, we generalise and study the recent Expected Sliced plans introduced by Liu et al. for completely generic measures. Our theoretical contributions are supported by numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets, including colour transfer and shape registration, evaluating the practical relevance of these different solutions.</description>

      <title>A Frank-Wolfe-based primal heuristic for quadratic mixed-integer optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a primal heuristic for quadratic mixed-integer problems. Our method extends the Boscia framework -- originally a mixed-integer convex solver leveraging a Frank-Wolfe-based branch-and-bound approach -- to address nonconvex quadratic objective and constraints. We reformulate nonlinear constraints, introduce preprocessing steps, and a suite of heuristics including rounding strategies, gradient-guided selection, and large neighborhood search techniques that exploit integer-feasible vertices generated during the Frank-Wolfe iterations. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in solving challenging MIQCQPs, achieving improvements on QPLIB instances within minutes and winning first place in the Land-Doig MIP Computational Competition 2025.</description>

      <title>Linesearch-free adaptive Bregman proximal gradient for convex minimization without relative smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces adaptive Bregman proximal gradient algorithms for solving convex composite minimization problems without relying on global relative smoothness or strong convexity assumptions. Building upon recent advances in adaptive stepsize selections, the proposed methods generate stepsizes based on local curvature estimates, entirely eliminating the need for backtracking linesearch. A key innovation is a Bregman generalization of Young's inequality, which allows controlling a critical inner product in terms of the same Bregman distances used in the updates. Our theory applies to problems where the differentiable term is merely locally smooth relative to a distance-generating function, without requiring the existence of global moduli or symmetry coefficients. Numerical experiments demonstrate their competitive performance compared to existing approaches across various problem classes.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-free Decentralized Algorithm for Composite Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies decentralized optimization over networks, where agents minimize a composite objective consisting of the sum of smooth convex functions--the agents' losses--and an additional nonsmooth convex extended value function. We propose a decentralized algorithm wherein agents ${\it adaptively}$ adjust their stepsize using local backtracking procedures that require ${\it no}$ ${\it global}$ (network) information or extensive inter-agent communications. Our adaptive decentralized method enjoys robust convergence guarantees, outperforming existing decentralized methods, which are not adaptive. Our design is centered on a three-operator splitting, applied to a reformulation of the optimization problem. This reformulation utilizes a proposed BCV metric, which facilitates decentralized implementation and local stepsize adjustments while guarantying convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an indefinite linear-quadratic partially observed mean-field game with common noise, incorporating both state-average and control-average effects. In our model, each agent's state is observed through both individual and public observations, which are modeled as general stochastic processes rather than Brownian motions. {It is noteworthy that} the weighting matrices in the cost functional are allowed to be indefinite. We derive the optimal decentralized strategies using the Hamiltonian approach and establish the well-posedness of the resulting Hamiltonian system by employing a relaxed compensator. The associated consistency condition and the feedback representation of decentralized strategies are also established. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the set of decentralized strategies form an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium. As an application, we solve a mean-variance portfolio selection problem.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dynamical system called the Multiobjective Balanced Gradient Flow (MBGF), offering a dynamical perspective for normalized gradient methods in a class of multi-objective optimization problems. Under certain assumptions, we prove the existence of solutions for MBGF trajectories and establish their convergence to weak Pareto points in the case of convex objective functions. For both convex and non-convex scenarios, we provide convergence rates of $O(1/t)$ and $O(1/\sqrt{t})$, respectively.</description>

      <title>MUTE-DSS: A Digital-Twin-Based Decision Support System for Minimizing Underwater Radiated Noise in Ship Voyage Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel MUTE-DSS, a digital-twin-based decision support system for minimizing underwater radiated noise (URN) during ship voyage planning. It is a ROS2-centric framework that integrates state-of-the-art acoustic models combining a semi-empirical reference spectrum for near-field modeling with 3D ray tracing for propagation losses for far-field modeling, offering real-time computation of the ship noise signature, alongside a data-driven Southern resident killer whale distribution model. The proposed DSS performs a two-stage optimization pipeline: Batch Informed Trees for collision-free ship routing and a genetic algorithm for adaptive ship speed profiling under voyage constraints that minimizes cumulative URN exposure to marine mammals. The effectiveness of MUTE-DSS is demonstrated through case studies of ships operating between the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, comparing optimized voyages against baseline trajectories derived from automatic identification system data. Results show substantial reductions in noise exposure level, up to 7.14 dB, corresponding to approximately an 80.68% reduction in a simplified scenario, and an average 4.90 dB reduction, corresponding to approximately a 67.6% reduction in a more realistic dynamic setting. These results illustrate the adaptability and practical utility of the proposed decision support system.</description>

      <title>Distributed games with jumps: An $\alpha$-potential game approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by game-theoretic models of crowd motion dynamics, this paper analyzes a broad class of distributed games with jump diffusions within the recently developed $\alpha$-potential game framework. We demonstrate that analyzing the $\alpha$-Nash equilibria reduces to solving a finite-dimensional control problem. Beyond the viscosity and verification characterizations for the general games, we explicitly and in detail examine how spatial population distributions and interaction rules influence the structure of $\alpha$-Nash equilibria in these distributed settings, and in particular for crowd motion games.
  Our theoretical results are supported by numerical implementations using policy gradient-based algorithms, further demonstrating the computational advantages of the $\alpha$-potential game framework in computing Nash equilibria for general dynamic games.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorems for Sample Average Approximations in Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish central limit theorems for the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method in discrete-time, finite-horizon Stochastic Optimal Control. Using the dynamic programming principle and backward induction, we characterize the limiting distributions of the SAA value functions. The asymptotic variance at each stage decomposes into two components: a current-stage variance arising from immediate randomness, and a propagated future variance accumulated from subsequent stages. This decomposition clarifies how statistical uncertainty propagates backward through time. Our derivation relies on a stochastic equicontinuity condition, for which we provide sufficient conditions. We illustrate the variance decomposition using the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem. Although its unbounded state and control spaces violate the compactness assumptions of our framework, the LQR setting enables explicit computation and visualization of both variance components.</description>

      <title>Exact algorithms for quadratic optimization over roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing a multivariate quadratic function where each decision variable is constrained to be a complex $m$'th root of unity. Such problems have applications in signal processing, MIMO detection, and the computation of ground states in statistical physics, among others. Our contributions in this paper are twofold. We first study the convergence of the sum-of-squares hierarchy and prove its convergence to the exact solution after only $\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$ levels (as opposed to $n$ levels). Our proof follows and generalizes the techniques and results used for the binary $m=2$ case developed by Fawzi, Saunderson, Parrilo. Second, we construct an integer binary reformulation of the problem based on zonotopes which reduces by half the number of binary variables in the simple reformulation. We show on numerical experiments that this reformulation can result in significant speedups (up to 10x) in solution time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Phased-Array Radars offer new possibilities for Optimization of Radar Search Pattern by using bi-dimensional beam forming and beam steering, along both elevation and azimuth axes. The minimization of the Time-Budget required for multiple Radar scanning missions in localized clutter, under constraints of range and detection probability, can be approximated as a Set Cover Problem. We present a Set Cover Problem approximation for Time-Budget minimization of the Radar Search Pattern, and solved this optimization problem using Integer Programming methods based on Branch\&amp;Bound and linear relaxation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Constraint-coupled Resource Allocation: Anytime Feasibility and Violation Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed resource allocation problems (DRAPs) with a coupled constraint for real-time systems. Based on primal-dual methods, we adopt a control perspective for optimization algorithm design by synthesizing a safe feedback controller using control barrier functions to enforce constraint satisfaction. On this basis, a distributed anytime-feasible resource allocation (DanyRA) algorithm is proposed. It is shown that DanyRA algorithm converges to the exact optimal solution of DRAPs while ensuring feasibility of the coupled inequality constraint at all time steps. Considering constraint violation arises from potential external interferences, a virtual queue with minimum buffer is incorporated to restore the constraint satisfaction before the pre-defined deadlines. We characterize the trade-off between convergence accuracy and violation robustness for maintaining or recovering feasibility. DanyRA algorithm is further extended to address DRAPs with a coupled equality constraint, and its linear convergence rate is theoretically established. Finally, a numerical example is provided for verification.</description>

      <title>Multi-material structural optimization for additive manufacturing based on a phase field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topology optimization problem in a phase field setting is considered to obtain rigid structures, which are resilient to external forces and constructable with additive manufacturing. Hence, large deformations of overhangs due to gravity shall be avoided during construction. The deformations depend on the stage of the construction and are modelled by linear elasticity equations on growing domains with height-dependent stress tensors and forces. Herewith, possible hardening effects can be included. Analytical results concerning the existence of minimizers and the differentiability of the reduced cost functional are presented in case of a finite number of construction layers. By proving Korn's inequality with a constant independent of the height, it is shown that the cost functional, formulated continuously in height, is well-defined. The problem is numerically solved using a projected gradient type method in function space, for which applicability is shown. Second-order information can be included by adapting the underlying inner product in every iteration. Additional adjustments enhancing the solver's performance, such as a nested procedure and subsystem solver specifcations, are stated. Numerical evidence is provided that for all discretization level and also for any number of construction layers, the iteration numbers stay roughly constant. The benefits of the nested procedure as well as of the inclusion of second order information are illustrated. Furthermore, the choice of weights for the penalization of overhangs is discussed. For various problem settings, results are presented for one or two materials and void in two as well as in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Threshold Phenomenon for the Shortest Lattice Vector Problem in the Infinity Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One important question in the theory of lattices is to detect a shortest vector: given a norm and a lattice, what is the smallest norm attained by a non-zero vector contained in the lattice? We focus on the infinity norm and work with lattices of the form $A\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $A$ has integer entries and is of full column rank. Finding a shortest vector is NP-hard. We show that this task is fixed parameter tractable in the parameter $\Delta$, the largest absolute value of the determinant of a full rank submatrix of $A$. The algorithm is based on a structural result that can be interpreted as a threshold phenomenon: whenever the dimension $n$ exceeds a certain value determined only by $\Delta$, then a shortest lattice vector attains an infinity norm value of one. This threshold phenomenon has several applications. In particular, it reveals that integer optimal solutions lie on faces of the given polyhedron whose dimensions are bounded only in terms of $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>ASPEN: An Additional Sampling Penalty Method for Finite-Sum Optimization Problems with Nonlinear Equality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for solving non-convex, nonlinear equality-constrained finite-sum optimization problems. The proposed algorithm incorporates an additional sampling strategy for sample size update into the well-known framework of quadratic penalty methods. Thus, depending on the problem at hand, the resulting method may exhibit a sample size strategy ranging from a mini-batch on one end, to increasing sample size that achieves the full sample eventually, on the other end of the spectrum. A non-monotone line search is used for the step size update, while the penalty parameter is also adaptive. The proposed algorithm avoids costly projections, which, together with the sample size update, may yield significant computational cost savings. Also, the proposed method can be viewed as a transition of an additional sampling approach for unconstrained and linear constrained problems, to a more general class with non-linear constraints. The almost sure convergence is proved under a standard set of assumptions for this framework, while numerical experiments on both academic and real-data based machine learning problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Controllability of finite-dimensional linear fractional systems under uncertain parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability of finite-dimensional linear fractional systems involving an uncertain parameter. We establish new results on the simultaneous and average controllability. In particular, we show that average controllability can be characterized by the so-called average Kalman rank condition and the average Gramian matrix. Moreover, using the average Gramian matrix, we design an open-loop control with minimal energy. These results can be seen as a natural generalization of the classical results known for systems with integer-order derivatives. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to robustly validate the theoretical findings, with a focus on the fractional R\"ossler system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical Merton portfolio choice problem over infinite horizon for high risk aversion, addressing technical challenges related to establishing the existence and identification of optimal strategies. Traditional methods rely on perturbation arguments and/or impose restrictive conditions, such as large discount rates and/or bounded strategies, to ensure well-posedness. Our approach leverages the problem's homogeneity to directly solve the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and verify the optimality of candidate strategies without requiring transversality conditions.</description>

      <title>The Design of Optimal Re-Insurance Contracts when Losses are Clustered</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the form of optimal reinsurance contracts in the case of clusters of losses. The underlying insured risk is represented by a marked Hawkes process, where the intensity of the jumps depends not only on the occurrence of previous jumps but also on the size of the jumps, which represents the financial magnitude of the loss. The reinsurance contracts are applied to each loss at the time of occurrence, but their structure is assumed to be constant. We derive closed-form formulas within the meanvariance framework. Additionally, we demonstrate that the optimal contract is not the classical excess-loss (deductible) form. The optimal contract is piecewise linear with three ranges: first, no reinsurance below a certain threshold; second, reinsurance with a slope greater than 1; and finally, full reinsurance. When the marked process converges to a Poisson process, we recover the optimality of the deductible form.</description>

      <title>Dam Management in the Era of Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change has a dramatic impact, particularly by concentrating rainfall into a few short periods, interspersed by long dry spells. In this context, the role of dams is crucial. We consider the optimal control of a dam, where the water level must not exceed a designated safety threshold, nor fall below a minimum level to ensure functionality and sustainability for for the outgoing river. To model dry spells and intense rainfall events, commonly referred to as water bombs, we introduce a Hawkes process, a well-known example of a self-exciting process characterised by time-correlated intensity, which endogenously reproduces the concentration of events. The problem is formulated as an optimal switching problem with constraints. We establish existence results and propose numerical methods for approximating the solution. Finally, we illustrate the main achievements of this approach through numerical examples. The main and counterintuitive result of our numerical analysis is that the optimal water level inside the dam increases with the self-exciting parameter. This result shows that, when facing the dilemma of managing the opposing risks of dam overtopping and dry spells, the former ultimately dominates the latter. In conclusion, dams will increasingly lose their role as water reserves and take on a greater role in flood protection.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Continuous-Time MILP for Integrated Aircraft Hangar Scheduling and Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient management of aircraft maintenance hangars is a critical operational challenge, involving complex, interdependent decisions regarding aircraft scheduling and spatial allocation. This paper introduces a novel continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this integrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable, our formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional discrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked against a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is demonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational results are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to proven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40 aircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all tested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly outperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic benefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between solution time and optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalized Burgers-Huxley equation with memory, subject to nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct a linear, finite-dimensional Dirichlet boundary feedback controller aimed at stabilizing the stationary solution corresponding to the homogeneous boundary condition. This controller is designed using eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. We begin by analyzing the stabilization of a linear system under the proposed feedback law. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the same controller also stabilizes the full nonlinear system by applying the Banach fixed point theorem. Finally, we provide a remark on the stabilization of the generalized Burgers-Huxley equation with memory around the zero solution under nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Branch &amp; Solve for Hub Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new formulation and solution framework for hub location problems. The formulation is based on 2-index aggregated flow variables and incorporates a set of aggregated demand constraints, which are novel in hub location. With minor adaptations, the approach applies to a large class of single- and multiple-allocation models, possibly incorporating flow bounds on activated arcs. General-purpose feasibility and optimality inequalities are also developed. Because of the small number of continuous variables, there is no need to project them out, differentiating the method from solution algorithms that rely heavily on feasibility and optimality cuts. The proposed Branch &amp; Solve solution framework leverages the nested structure of the problems, by solving auxiliary subproblems at selected nodes of the enumeration tree. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances from the literature confirm the good performance of the proposal: the basic version of the algorithm is able to solve to proven optimality instances with up to 200 nodes for several hub location families.</description>

Abstract: The optimal control problem of stochastic systems is commonly solved via robust or scenario-based optimization methods, which are both challenging to scale to long optimization horizons. We cast the optimal control problem of a stochastic system as a convex optimization problem over occupation measures. We demonstrate our method on a set of synthetic and real-world scenarios, learning cost functions from data via Christoffel polynomials.

      <title>On Some Tunable Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive) high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process (GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies (including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).</description>

      <title>3D Reconstruction via Incremental Structure From Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding. While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper, we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured environments.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Decentralized Resource Optimization for Cell-Free ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for 6G wireless networks, allowing the joint use of spectrum and infrastructure for both communication and sensing. While prior ISAC solutions have addressed resource optimization, including power allocation, beamforming, and waveform design, they often rely on centralized architectures with full network knowledge, limiting their scalability in distributed systems. In this paper, we propose two coordinated decentralized optimization algorithms for beamforming and power allocation tailored to cell-free ISAC networks. The first algorithm employs locally designed fixed beamformers at access points (APs), combined with a centralized power allocation scheme computed at a central server (CS). The second algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming and power control through a fully decentralized consensus ADMM framework. Both approaches rely on local information at APs and limited coordination with the CS. Simulation results obtained using our proposed Python-based simulation framework evaluate their fronthaul overhead and system-level performance, demonstrating their practicality for scalable ISAC deployment in decentralized, cell-free architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence of minimal solutions to two-point boundary value problems for quasi-monotone dynamical systems. Specifically, the pointwise infimum of all supersolutions is shown to coincide with the minimal solution. This result is then applied to establish a non-uniqueness result for strong stable solutions to a class of mean field games with a continuum of players.</description>

      <title>Families of Transfers from circular low Earth orbit to Distant Prograde Orbit around the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distant prograde orbits around the Moon exhibit remarkable potential for practical applications such as cislunar surveillance activities and low-energy transfers due to their instability. Previous works on transfers from circular low Earth orbit to distant prograde orbits mainly focused on construction methods based on dynamical structures, lacking a comprehensive analysis of the solution space of this transfer scenario. This paper investigates the solution space and identifies families of transfers from a 167 km circular low Earth orbit to a 1:1 distant prograde orbit. In particular, grid search and trajectory continuation are performed to construct these transfer trajectories. Initial guesses of the transfers are selected in the 1:1 distant prograde orbit through a backward propagation strategy and are then corrected to satisfy specified constraints. Based on the obtained solutions, a linear predictor is derived to predict more feasible solutions and a predictor-corrector continuation method is used to extend the solution space. Twelve transfer families are identified, most of which are new or previously underexplored. The distributions of construction parameters and transfer characteristics of these twelve families are analyzed and discussed, showing which families are applicable to which types of specific practical missions. Comparison between the obtained solution and solution developed by previous works is further performed to imply the effects of the selection of dynamical model on transfer construction.</description>

      <title>Decision Theory For Large Scale Outlier Detection Using Aleatoric Uncertainty: With a Note on Bayesian FDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aleatoric and Epistemic uncertainty have achieved recent attention in the literature as different sources from which uncertainty can emerge in stochastic modeling. Epistemic being intrinsic or model based notions of uncertainty, and aleatoric being the uncertainty inherent in the data. We propose a novel decision theoretic framework for outlier detection in the context of aleatoric uncertainty; in the context of Bayesian modeling. The model incorporates bayesian false discovery rate control for multiplicty adjustment, and a new generalization of Bayesian FDR is introduced. The model is applied to simulations based on temporally fluctuating outlier detection where fixing thresholds often results in poor performance due to nonstationarity, and a case study is outlined on on a novel cybersecurity detection. Cyberthreat signals are highly nonstationary; giving a credible stress test of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by trying to understand the behavior of the simplex method, Athanasiadis, De Loera and Zhang provided upper and lower bounds on the number of the monotone paths on 3-polytopes. For simple 3-polytopes with $2n$ vertices, they showed that the number of monotone paths is bounded above by $(1+\varphi)^n$, with $\varphi$ being the golden ratio. We improve the result and show that for a larger family of graphs the number is bounded above by $c \cdot 1.6779^n$ for some universal constant $c$. Meanwhile, the best known construction and conjectured extremizer is approximately $\varphi^n$.</description>

Abstract: Completely positive operators are fundamental objects in quantum information theory and the capacity of such operators plays a pivotal role in the operator scaling algorithm. Using this algorithm, Garg--Gurvits--Oliveira--Wigderson recently established a certain quantitative continuity result for the capacity map at rational points. We show by different means that operator capacity possesses significantly greater regularity. Our argument gives local H\"{o}lder continuity at all points and rests on a result of Bennett--Bez--Buschenhenke--Cowling--Flock on weighted sums of exponential functions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transfer Mechanism for Municipal Soft-Budget Constraints in Newfoundland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Newfoundland and Labrador's municipalities face severe soft-budget pressures due to narrow tax bases, high fixed service costs, and volatile resource revenues. We develop a Stackelberg-style mechanism-design model in which the province commits at initial stage to an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post bailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal-need type, choose effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a statutory threshold. Under convexity and single-crossing (or virtual monotonicity with ironing), the problem reduces to one-dimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal rule is threshold--linear--cap: no bailouts below a participation cutoff; a linear ramp-up up to a cap; and a hard cap thereafter. A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no-bailout regime, and an explicit discount-factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible. The closed-form characterisation provides a policy template that maps to Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future calibration.</description>

      <title>Model reduction for fully nonlinear stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Non-Uniform Scaling Control of Multi-Agent Formation via Matrix-Valued Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed formation maneuver control refers to the problem of maneuvering a group of agents to change their formation shape by adjusting the motions of partial agents, where the controller of each agent only requires local information measured from its neighbors. Although this problem has been extensively investigated, existing approaches are mostly limited to uniform scaling transformations. This article proposes a new type of local matrix-valued constraints, via which non-uniform scaling control of position formation can be achieved by tuning the positions of only two agents (i.e., leaders). Here, the non-uniform scaling transformation refers to scaling the position formation with different ratios along different orthogonal coordinate directions. Moreover, by defining scaling and translation of attitude formation, we propose a distributed control scheme for scaling and translation maneuver control of joint position-attitude formations. It is proven that the proposed controller achieves global convergence, provided that the sensing graph among agents is a 2-rooted bidirectional graph. Compared with the affine formation maneuver control approach, the proposed approach leverages a sparser sensing graph, requires fewer leaders, and additionally enables scaling transformations of the attitude formation. A simulation example is proposed to demonstrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Novel Sliced Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however, challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries, strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW. Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance; especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for optimal control of hybrid systems with sliding motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.04754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns two algorithms for solving optimal control problems with hybrid systems. The first algorithm aims at hybrid systems exhibiting sliding modes. The first algorithm has several features which distinguishes it from the other algorithms for problems described by hybrid systems. First of all, it can cope with hybrid systems which exhibit sliding modes. Secondly, the systems motion on the switching surface is described by index 2 differential--algebraic equations and that guarantees accurate tracking of the sliding motion surface. Thirdly, the gradients of the problems functionals are evaluated with the help of adjoint equations. The adjoint equations presented in the paper take into account sliding motion and exhibit jump conditions at transition times. We state optimality conditions in the form of the weak maximum principle for optimal control problems with hybrid systems exhibiting sliding modes and with piecewise differentiable controls. The second algorithm is for optimal control problems with hybrid systems which do not exhibit sliding motion. In the case of this algorithm we assume that control functions are measurable functions. For each algorithm, we show that every accumulation point of the sequence generated by the algorithm satisfies the weak maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Non-Sequential Decentralized Stochastic Control Revisited: Causality and Static Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03949v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decentralized stochastic control (or stochastic team theory) and game theory, if there is a pre-defined order in a system in which agents act, the system is called \textit{sequential}, otherwise it is non-sequential. Much of the literature on stochastic control theory, such as studies on the existence analysis, approximation methods, and on dynamic programming or other analytical or learning theoretic methods, have focused on sequential systems. Many complex practical systems, however, are non-sequential where the order of agents acting is random, and dependent on the realization of solution paths and prior actions taken. The study of such systems is particularly challenging as tools applicable for sequential models are not directly applicable. In this paper, we will first revisit the notion of Causality (a definition due to Witsenhausen and which has been refined by Andersland and Tekenetzis), and provide an alternative representation using imaginary agents. We show that Causality is equivalent to Causal Implementability (and Dead-Lock Freeness), thus, generalizing previous results. We show that Causality, under an absolute continuity condition, allows for an equivalent static model whose reduction is policy-independent. Since the static reduction method for sequential control problems (via change of measures or other techniques), has been shown to be very effective in arriving at existence, structural, approximation and learning theoretic results, our analysis facilitates much of the stochastic analysis available for sequential systems to also be applicable for a class of non-sequential systems.</description>

      <title>An entropy penalized approach for stochastic control problems. Complete version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an original approach to stochastic control problems. We consider a weak formulation that is written as an optimization (minimization) problem on the space of probability measures. We then introduce a penalized version of this problem obtained by splitting the minimization variables and penalizing the discrepancy between the two variables via an entropy term. We show that the penalized problem provides a good approximation of the original problem when the weight of the entropy penalization term is large enough. Moreover, the penalized problem has the advantage of giving rise to two optimization subproblems that are easy to solve in each of the two optimization variables when the other is fixed. We take advantage of this property to propose an alternating optimization procedure that converges to the infimum of the penalized problem with a rate $O(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. The relevance of this approach is illustrated by solving a high-dimensional stochastic control problem aimed at controlling consumption in electrical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forward-flatness is a generalization of static feedback linearizability and a special case of a more general flatness concept for discrete-time systems. Recently, it has been shown that this practically quite relevant property can be checked by computing a unique sequence of involutive distributions which generalizes the well-known static feedback linearization test. In this paper, a dual test for forward-flatness based on a unique sequence of integrable codistributions is derived. Since the main mathematical operations for determining this sequence are the intersection of codistributions and the calculation of Lie derivatives of 1-forms, it is computationally quite efficient. Furthermore, the formulation with codistributions also facilitates a comparison with the existing discrete-time literature regarding the closely related topic of dynamic feedback linearization, which is mostly formulated in terms of 1-forms rather than vector fields. The presented results are illustrated by two examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel optimisation is used in inverse imaging problems for hyperparameter learning/identification and experimental design, for instance, to find optimal regularisation parameters and forward operators. However, computationally, the process is costly. To reduce this cost, recently so-called single-loop approaches have been introduced. On each step of an outer optimisation method, they take just a single gradient step towards the solution of the inner problem. In this paper, we flexibilise the inner algorithm to include standard methods in inverse imaging. Moreover, as we have recently shown, significant performance improvements can be obtained in PDE-constrained optimisation by interweaving the steps of conventional iterative linear system solvers with the optimisation method. We now demonstrate how the adjoint equation in bilevel problems can also benefit from such interweaving. We evaluate the performance of our approach on identifying the deconvolution kernel for image deblurring, and the subsampling operator for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) can be aggregated to offer flexibility to power systems. However, the rapid growth in EV adoption leads to increased grid-level carbon emissions due to higher EV charging demand, challenging grid decarbonization efforts. Quantifying and managing the EV flexibility while controlling carbon emissions is crucial. This paper introduces a methodology for carbon-aware quantification of real-time aggregate EV power flexibility based on the Lyapunov optimization technique. We construct a novel queue system including EV charging queues, delay-aware virtual queues, and carbon-aware virtual queues. Based on the evolution of these queues, we define the Lyapunov drift and minimize the drift-plus-penalty term to get the real-time EV flexibility interval, which is reported to the system operator for flexibility provision. To enhance EV flexibility, we integrate dispatch signals from the system operator into the queue updates through a two-stage disaggregation process. The proposed approach is prediction-free and adaptable to various uncertainties, including EV arrivals and grid carbon intensity. Additionally, the maximum charging delay of EV charging tasks is theoretically bounded by a constant, and carbon emissions are effectively controlled. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed online method and highlight its advantages over several benchmarks through comparisons.</description>

      <title>A New Crossover Algorithm for LP Inspired by the Spiral Dynamic of PDHG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by large-scale applications, there is a recent trend of research on using first-order methods for solving LP. Among them, PDLP, which is based on a primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm, may be the most promising one. In this paper, we present a geometric viewpoint on the behavior of PDHG for LP. We demonstrate that PDHG iterates exhibit a spiral pattern with a closed-form solution when the variable basis remains unchanged. This spiral pattern consists of two orthogonal components: rotation and forward movement, where rotation improves primal and dual feasibility, while forward movement advances the duality gap. We also characterize the different situations in which basis change events occur. Inspired by the spiral behavior of PDHG, we design a new crossover algorithm to obtain a vertex solution from any optimal LP solution. This approach differs from traditional simplex-based crossover methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its potential as an alternative option for crossover.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-order Stochastic Cubic Newton Method Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22357v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies stochastic minimization of a finite-sum loss $ F (\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\xi=1}^N f(\mathbf{x};\xi) $. In many real-world scenarios, the Hessian matrix of such objectives exhibits a low-rank structure on a batch of data. At the same time, zeroth-order optimization has gained prominence in important applications such as fine-tuning large language models. Drawing on these observations, we propose a novel stochastic zeroth-order cubic Newton method that leverages the low-rank Hessian structure via a matrix recovery-based estimation technique. Our method circumvents restrictive incoherence assumptions, enabling accurate Hessian approximation through finite-difference queries. Theoretically, we establish that for most real-world problems in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n}{\eta^{\frac{7}{2}}}\right)+\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{n^2 }{\eta^{\frac{5}{2}}}\right)$ function evaluations suffice to attain a second-order $\eta$-stationary point with high probability. This represents a significant improvement in dimensional dependence over existing methods. This improvement is mostly due to a new Hessian estimator that achieves superior sample complexity; This new Hessian estimation method might be of separate interest. Numerical experiments on matrix recovery and machine learning tasks validate the efficacy and scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Applications of Automatic Differentiation in Image Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that automatic differentiation (AD), which has become commonly available in machine learning frameworks, is an efficient way to explore ideas that lead to algorithmic improvement in multi-scale affine image registration and affine super-resolution problems. In our first experiment on multi-scale registration, we implement an ODE predictor-corrector method involving a derivative with respect to the scale parameter and the Hessian of an image registration objective function, both of which would be difficult to compute without AD. Our findings indicate that exact Hessians are necessary for the method to provide any benefits over a traditional multi-scale method; a Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation fails to provide such benefits. In our second experiment, we implement a variable projected Gauss-Newton method for super-resolution and use AD to differentiate through the iteratively computed projection, a method previously unaddressed in the literature. We show that Jacobians obtained without differentiating through the projection are poor approximations to the true Jacobians of the variable projected forward map and explore the performance of other approximations in the problem of super-resolution. By addressing these problems, this work contributes to the application of AD in image registration and sets a precedent for further use of machine learning tools in this field.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Analysis For Monotonically Forward-Backward Accelerated Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) achieves faster convergence than gradient descent for convex optimization but lacks monotonicity in function values. To address this, Beck and Teboulle [2009b] proposed a monotonic variant, M-NAG, and extended it to the proximal setting as M-FISTA for composite problems such as Lasso. However, establishing the linear convergence of M-NAG and M-FISTA under strong convexity remains an open problem. In this paper, we analyze M-NAG via the implicit-velocity phase representation and show that an additional assumption, either the position update or the phase-coupling relation, is necessary to fully recover the NAG iterates. The essence of M-NAG lies in controlling an auxiliary sequence to enforce non-increase. We further demonstrate that the M-NAG update alone is sufficient to construct a Lyapunov function guaranteeing linear convergence, without relying on full NAG iterates. By modifying the mixed sequence to incorporate forward-indexed gradients, we develop a new Lyapunov function that removes the kinetic energy term, enabling a direct extension to M-NAG. The required starting index depends only on the momentum parameter and not on problem constants. Finally, leveraging newly developed proximal inequalities, we extend our results to M-FISTA, establishing its linear convergence and deepening the theoretical understanding of monotonic accelerated methods.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Dynamic Potential LQ Games with Sequentially Revealed Costs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel finite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) feedback dynamic potential game with a priori unknown cost matrices played between two players. The cost matrices are revealed to the players sequentially, with the potential for future values to be previewed over a short time window. We propose an algorithm that enables the players to predict and track a feedback Nash equilibrium trajectory, and we measure the quality of their resulting decisions by introducing the concept of \emph{price of uncertainty}. We show that under the proposed algorithm, the price of uncertainty is bounded by horizon-invariant constants. The constants are the sum of three terms; the first and second terms decay exponentially as the preview window grows, and another depends on the magnitude of the differences between the cost matrices for each player. Through simulations, we illustrate that the resulting price of uncertainty initially decays at an exponential rate as the preview window lengthens, then remains constant for large time horizons.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a compact implementation of a recently proposed strongly polynomial-time algorithm for the general linear programming problem. Each iteration of the algorithm consists of applying a pair of complementary Gauss-Jordan (GJ) pivoting operations. In this compact implementation of the algorithm, the GJ pivoting operations are done inside a matrix that has half the size of the original matrix. A numerical illustration is given.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Gradient Descent Method for Globally Minimizing Nearly Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic gradient descent method with an adaptive Gaussian noise term for the global minimization of nearly convex functions, which are nonconvex and possess multiple strict local minimizers. The noise term, independent of the gradient, is determined by the difference between the current function value and a lower bound estimate of the optimal value. In both probability space and state space, we show that the proposed algorithm converges linearly to a neighborhood of the global optimal solution. The size of this neighborhood depends on the variance of the gradient and the deviation between the estimated lower bound and the optimal value. In particular, when full gradient information is available and a sharp lower bound of the objective function is provided, the algorithm achieves linear convergence to the global optimum. Furthermore, we introduce a double-loop scheme that alternately updates the lower bound estimate and the optimization sequence, enabling convergence to a neighborhood of the global optimum that depends solely on the gradient variance. Numerical experiments on several benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>PolarGrad: A Class of Matrix-Gradient Optimizers from a Unifying Preconditioning Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and datasets underscores the critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing "matrix-aware" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon.</description>

      <title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a difference of (smooth) convex functions over a compact convex feasible region $P$, i.e., $\min_{x \in P} f(x) - g(x)$, with smooth $f$ and Lipschitz continuous $g$. This computational study builds upon and complements the framework of Maskan et al. [2025] by integrating advanced Frank-Wolfe variants to reduce computational overhead. We empirically show that constrained DC problems can be efficiently solved using a combination of the Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradients (BPCG) algorithm [Tsuji et al., 2022] with warm-starting and the adaptive error bound from Maskan et al. [2025]. The result is a highly efficient and scalable projection-free algorithm for constrained DC optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a sub-class of bi-matrix games which we refer to as two-person (hereafter referred to as two-player) additively-separable sum (TPASS) games, where the sum of the pay-offs of the two players is additively separable. The row player's pay-off at each pair of pure strategies, is the sum of two numbers, the first of which may be dependent on the pure strategy chosen by the column player and the second being independent of the pure strategy chosen by the column player. The column player's pay-off at each pair of pure strategies, is also the sum of two numbers, the first of which may be dependent on the pure strategy chosen by the row player and the second being independent of the pure strategy chosen by the row player. The sum of the inter-dependent components of the pay-offs of the two players is assumed to be zero. We show that a (randomized or mixed) strategy pair is an equilibrium of the game if and only if there exist two other real numbers such that the three together solve a certain linear programming problem. In order to prove this result, we need to appeal to the existence of an equilibrium for the TPASS game. Before proving the desired result concerning the equivalence of the two sets, we provide a simple proof of the existence of equilibrium of TPASS games, using the strong duality theorem and the complementary slackness theorem of linear programming. We also show that any equilibrium for the TPASS game along with appropriate scalars solve the linear programming and its dual that is used to prove the existence result.</description>

Abstract: This paper generalizes the dynamical system proposed by Wang et al. [Siam. J. Sci. Comput., 2021] to multiobjective optimization by investigating a multiobjective accelerated gradient-like flow with asymptotically vanishing normalized gradient. Using Lyapunov analysis, we obtain convergence rates of $O(1/t^2)$ and $O(\ln^2 t / t^2)$ for the trajectory solution under two distinct parameter selections. Under certain assumptions, we further prove that the trajectory solution of this gradient flow converges to a weak Pareto solution for convex multiobjective optimization problems. Through corresponding discretization, we derive a new class of multiobjective gradient methods achieving a convergence rate of $O(\ln^2 k / k^2)$. Additionally, numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, demonstrating that this gradient flow outperforms other existing dynamical systems in the literature regarding convergence speed, and our algorithm exhibits corresponding advantages.</description>

      <title>Towards a Linear-Ramp QAOA protocol: Evidence of a scaling advantage in solving some combinatorial optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), with performance governed by variational parameters $\{\gamma_i, \beta_i\}_{i=0}^{p-1}$. While most prior work has focused on classically optimizing these parameters, we demonstrate that fixed linear ramp schedules, linear ramp QAOA (LR-QAOA), can efficiently approximate optimal solutions across diverse COPs. Simulations with up to $N_q=42$ qubits and $p=400$ layers suggest that the success probability scales as $P(x^*) \approx 2^{-\eta(p) N_q + C}$, where $\eta(p)$ decreases with increasing $p$. For example, in Weighted Maxcut instances, $\eta(10) = 0.22$ improves to $\eta(100) = 0.05$. Comparisons with classical algorithms, including simulated annealing, Tabu Search, and branch-and-bound, show a scaling advantage for LR-QAOA. We show results of LR-QAOA on multiple QPUs (IonQ, Quantinuum, IBM) with up to $N_q = 109$ qubits, $p=100$, and circuits requiring 21,200 CNOT gates. Finally, we present a noise model based on two-qubit gate counts that accurately reproduces the experimental behavior of LR-QAOA.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Intensity Control: An Application to Choice-Based Network Revenue Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensity control is a type of continuous-time dynamic optimization problems with many important applications in Operations Research including queueing and revenue management. In this study, we adapt the reinforcement learning framework to intensity control using choice-based network revenue management as a case study, which is a classical problem in revenue management that features a large state space, a large action space and a continuous time horizon. We show that by utilizing the inherent discretization of the sample paths created by the jump points, a unique and defining feature of intensity control, one does not need to discretize the time horizon in advance, which was believed to be necessary because most reinforcement learning algorithms are designed for discrete-time problems. As a result, the computation can be facilitated and the discretization error is significantly reduced. We lay the theoretical foundation for the Monte Carlo and temporal difference learning algorithms for policy evaluation and develop policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithms for intensity control. Via a comprehensive numerical study, we demonstrate the benefit of our approach versus other state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in capturing target data distributions from large datasets. However, fine-tuning these massive models for specific downstream tasks, constraints, and human preferences remains a critical challenge. While recent advances have leveraged reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle this problem, much of the progress has been empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a stochastic control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. Building on denoising diffusion probabilistic models as the pre-trained reference dynamics, our approach integrates linear dynamics control with Kullback-Leibler regularization. We establish the well-posedness and regularity of the stochastic control problem and develop a policy iteration algorithm (PI-FT) for numerical solution. We show that PI-FT achieves global convergence at a linear rate. Unlike existing work that assumes regularities throughout training, we prove that the control and value sequences generated by the algorithm maintain the regularity. Additionally, we explore extensions of our framework to parametric settings and continuous-time formulations.</description>

      <title>Learning to Fuse Temporal Proximity Networks: A Case Study in Chimpanzee Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we identify groups of primate individuals which could be conjectured to drive social structure? To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency for consecutive time steps. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Newton Extremum Seeking using Delays and Time-Periodic Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study prescribed-time extremum seeking (PT-ES) for scalar maps in the presence of time delay. The PT-ES problem has been solved by Yilmaz and Krstic in 2023 using chirpy probing and time-varying singular gains. To alleviate the gain singularity, we present an alternative approach, employing delays with bounded time-periodic gains, for achieving prescribed-time convergence to the extremum. Our results are not extensions or refinements but a new methodological direction, even in the absence of the delay on the map. The main result we present compensates the map's delay and uses perturbation-based and the Newton (rather than gradient) approaches. With the help of averaging theorems in infinite dimension, specifically Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs), we conduct a prescribed-time convergence analysis on a suitable perturbation-averaged target ES system, which contains the time-periodic gains of the map and feedback delays. We further extend our method to multi-variable static maps and illustrate our results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Robustly Learning Monotone Generalized Linear Models via Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning Generalized Linear models (GLMs) in the agnostic model under the Gaussian distribution. We give the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a constant-factor approximation for \textit{any} monotone Lipschitz activation. Prior constant-factor GLM learners succeed for a substantially smaller class of activations. Our work resolves a well-known open problem, by developing a robust counterpart to the classical GLMtron algorithm (Kakade et al., 2011). Our robust learner applies more generally, encompassing all monotone activations with bounded $(2+\zeta)$-moments, for any fixed $\zeta&gt;0$ -- a condition that is essentially necessary. To obtain our results, we leverage a novel data augmentation technique with decreasing Gaussian noise injection and prove a number of structural results that may be useful in other settings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality of Projected Inventory Level Policies for Lost Sales Inventory Systems with Large Leadtime and Penalty Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the canonical periodic review lost sales inventory system with positive leadtime and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) demand under the average cost criterion. We demonstrate that the relative value function under the constant order policy satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equation. We employ ladder processes associated with a random walk featuring i.i.d. increments, to obtain an explicit solution for the relative value function. This solution can be expressed as a quadratic form and a term that grows sublinearly. Then we perform an approximate policy iteration step on the constant order policy and uniformly bound the gap relative to the otimal cost rate for large lead times. This leads to our main result that projected inventory level policies are asymptotically optimal as the leadtime grows when the cost of losing a sale is sufficiently large and demand has a finite second moment.</description>

      <title>Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space Meta-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.</description>

      <title>On Strongly Convex Sets and Farthest Distance Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A polarity notion for sets in a Banach space is introduced in such a way that the second polar of a set coincides with the smallest strongly convex set with respect to R that contains it. Strongly convex sets are characterized in terms of their associated farthest distance functions, and farthest distance functions associated with strongly convex sets are characterized, too.</description>

      <title>The hierarchical barycenter: conditional probability simulation with structured and unobserved covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for conditional probability density simulation. The method is design to work with unstructured data set when data are not characterized by the same covariates yet share common information. Specific examples considered in the text are relative to two main classes: homogeneous data characterized by samples with missing value for the covariates and data set divided in two or more groups characterized by covariates that are only partially overlapping. The methodology is based on the mathematical theory of optimal transport extending the barycenter problem to the newly defined hierarchical barycenter problem. A newly, data driven, numerical procedure for the solution of the hierarchical barycenter problem is proposed and its advantages, over the use of classical barycenter, are illustrated on synthetic and real world data sets.</description>
