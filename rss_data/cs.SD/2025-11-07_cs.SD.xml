      <title>MIDI-LLM: Adapting Large Language Models for Text-to-MIDI Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MIDI-LLM, an LLM for generating multitrack MIDI music from free-form text prompts. Our approach expands a text LLM's vocabulary to include MIDI tokens, and uses a two-stage training recipe to endow text-to-MIDI abilities. By preserving the original LLM's parameter structure, we can directly leverage the vLLM library for accelerated inference. Experiments show that MIDI-LLM achieves higher quality, better text control, and faster inference compared to the recent Text2midi model. Live demo at https://midi-llm-demo.vercel.app.</description>

      <title>MusRec: Zero-Shot Text-to-Music Editing via Rectified Flow and Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music editing has emerged as an important and practical area of artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from video game and film music production to personalizing existing tracks according to user preferences. However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true zero-shot capability. Leveraging recent advances in rectified flow and diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, the first zero-shot text-to-music editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>PromptSep: Generative Audio Separation via Multimodal Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in language-queried audio source separation (LASS) have shown that generative models can achieve higher separation audio quality than traditional masking-based approaches. However, two key limitations restrict their practical use: (1) users often require operations beyond separation, such as sound removal; and (2) relying solely on text prompts can be unintuitive for specifying sound sources. In this paper, we propose PromptSep to extend LASS into a broader framework for general-purpose sound separation. PromptSep leverages a conditional diffusion model enhanced with elaborated data simulation to enable both audio extraction and sound removal. To move beyond text-only queries, we incorporate vocal imitation as an additional and more intuitive conditioning modality for our model, by incorporating Sketch2Sound as a data augmentation strategy. Both objective and subjective evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PromptSep achieves state-of-the-art performance in sound removal and vocal-imitation-guided source separation, while maintaining competitive results on language-queried source separation.</description>

      <title>CantoASR: Prosody-Aware ASR-LALM Collaboration for Low-Resource Cantonese</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility, yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data, six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR, a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.</description>

      <title>Back to Ear: Perceptually Driven High Fidelity Music Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are essential for large-scale audio tasks like diffusion-based generation. However, existing open-source models often neglect auditory perceptual aspects during training, leading to weaknesses in phase accuracy and stereophonic spatial representation. To address these challenges, we propose {\epsilon}ar-VAE, an open-source music signal reconstruction model that rethinks and optimizes the VAE training paradigm. Our contributions are threefold: (i) A K-weighting perceptual filter applied prior to loss calculation to align the objective with auditory perception. (ii) Two novel phase losses: a Correlation Loss for stereo coherence, and a Phase Loss using its derivatives--Instantaneous Frequency and Group Delay--for precision. (iii) A new spectral supervision paradigm where magnitude is supervised by all four Mid/Side/Left/Right components, while phase is supervised only by the LR components. Experiments show {\epsilon}ar-VAE at 44.1kHz substantially outperforms leading open-source models across diverse metrics, showing particular strength in reconstructing high-frequency harmonics and the spatial characteristics.</description>

      <title>dCoNNear: An Artifact-Free Neural Network Architecture for Closed-loop Audio Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly improved various audio processing applications, including speech enhancement, synthesis, and hearing-aid algorithms. DNN-based closed-loop systems have gained popularity in these applications due to their robust performance and ability to adapt to diverse conditions. Despite their effectiveness, current DNN-based closed-loop systems often suffer from sound quality degradation caused by artifacts introduced by suboptimal sampling methods. To address this challenge, we introduce dCoNNear, a novel DNN architecture designed for seamless integration into closed-loop frameworks. This architecture specifically aims to prevent the generation of spurious artifacts-most notably tonal and aliasing artifacts arising from non-ideal sampling layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of dCoNNear through a proof-of-principle example within a closed-loop framework that employs biophysically realistic models of auditory processing for both normal and hearing-impaired profiles to design personalized hearing-aid algorithms. We further validate the broader applicability and artifact-free performance of dCoNNear through speech-enhancement experiments, confirming its ability to improve perceptual sound quality without introducing architecture-induced artifacts. Our results show that dCoNNear not only accurately simulates all processing stages of existing non-DNN biophysical models but also significantly improves sound quality by eliminating audible artifacts in both hearing-aid and speech-enhancement applications. This study offers a robust, perceptually transparent closed-loop processing framework for high-fidelity audio applications.</description>
