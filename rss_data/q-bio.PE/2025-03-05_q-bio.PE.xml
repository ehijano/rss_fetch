      <title>Fungal Genetic Variants in Oceanic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing specific types of organisms as they are found across environmental conditions has helped inform how genes and gene products of these organisms relate to phenotypes and adaptation. In this study, we examine metatranscriptomic data as found for oceanic fungi across different oceanic sampling sites. A specific set of three genes was chosen for evaluation based on conserved orthology, known association with core physiological processes in fungi, and level of abundance within oceanic metatranscriptomic data. We report upon a potential association of genetic variance with environmental conditions of iron, salt and phosphate in oceanic waters based on heatmap visualization and PERMANOVA analysis.</description>

      <title>Spatial competition and repulsion: pattern formation and the role of movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter investigates some mechanisms behind pattern formation driven by competitive-only or repelling interactions, and explores how these patterns are influenced by different types of particle movement. Despite competition and repulsion are both anti-crowding interactions, collective effects may lead to clusters of individuals, which can arrange periodically. Through the analysis of two models, it provides insights into the similarities and differences in the patterns formed and underlines the role of movement in shaping the spatial distribution of biological populations.</description>

      <title>Unlocking tropical forest complexity: How tree assemblages in secondary forests boost biodiversity conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary forests now dominate tropical landscapes and play a crucial role in achieving COP15 conservation objectives. This study develops a replicable national approach to identifying and characterising forest ecosystems, with a focus on the role of secondary forests. We hypothesised that dominant tree species in the forest canopy serve as reliable indicators for delineating forest ecosystems and untangling biodiversity complexity. Using national inventories, we identified in situ clusters through hierarchical clustering based on dominant species abundance dissimilarity, determined using the Importance Variable Index. These clusters were characterised by analysing species assemblages and their interactions. We then applied object-oriented Random Forest modelling, segmenting the national forest cover using NDVI to identify the forest ecosystems derived from in situ clusters. Freely available spectral (Sentinel-2) and environmental data were used in the model to delineate and characterise key forest ecosystems. We finished with an assessment of distribution of secondary and old-growth forests within ecosystems. In Costa Rica, 495 dominant tree species defined 10 in situ clusters, with 7 main clusters successfully modelled. The modelling (F1-score: 0.73, macro F1-score: 0.58) and species-based characterisation highlighted the main ecological trends of these ecosystems, which are distinguished by specific species dominance, topography, climate, and vegetation dynamics, aligning with local forest classifications. The analysis of secondary forest distribution provided an initial assessment of ecosystem vulnerability by evaluating their role in forest maintenance and dynamics. This approach also underscored the major challenge of in situ data acquisition</description>

      <title>Proliferating active disks with game dynamical interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of self-propelled, proliferating finite-size disks with game-theoretical interactions, where growth rates depend on local population composition. We analyze how these interactions influence spatial distribution, coexistence, and extinction. Three scenarios emerge: (i) stable coexistence with well-mixed distributions, (ii) bistability, where the outcome depends on initial conditions, and (iii) dominance, where one species always outcompetes the other. We further show that activity enhances spatial mixing in coexistence and reduces extinction times in both dominance and bistability. Additionally, stronger interactions promote coexistence while accelerating extinction in the latter two regimes. By varying diffusivity, activity, and interaction strength, we show how movement and spatial constraints affect population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Les Houches lectures on Theoretical Ecology: High-dimensional models and extreme events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of ecological systems is gaining momentum in modern scientific research, driven by an abundance of empirical data and advancements in bioengineering techniques. However, a full understanding of their dynamical and thermodynamical properties, also in light of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, remains a formidable endeavor. From a theoretical standpoint, modeling the interactions within these complex systems -- such as bacteria in microbial communities, plant-pollinator networks in forests, or starling murmurations -- presents a significant challenge. Given the characteristic high dimensionality of the datasets, alternative elegant approaches employ random matrix formalism and techniques from disordered systems. In these lectures, we will explore two cornerstone models in theoretical ecology: the MacArthur/Resource-Consumer model, and the Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, with a special focus on systems composed of a large number of interacting species. In the second part, we will highlight timely directions, particularly to bridge the gap with empirical observations and detect macroecological patterns.</description>

      <title>Social hierarchy shapes foraging decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social foraging is a widespread form of animal foraging in which groups of individuals coordinate their decisions to exploit resources in the environment. Animals show a variety of social structures from egalitarian to hierarchical. In this study, we examine how different forms of social hierarchy shape foraging decisions. We developed a mechanistic analytically tractable model to study the underlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic individual to the macroscopic group levels. Based on a stochastic evidence accumulation framework, we developed a model of patch-leaving decisions in a large hierarchical group with leading and following individuals. Across a variety of information sharing mechanisms, we were able to analytically quantify emergent collective dynamics. We found that follower-leader dynamics through observations of leader movements or through counting the number of individuals in a patch confers, for most conditions, a benefit for the following individuals by increasing their accuracy in inferring patch richness. On the other hand, misinformation, through the communication of false beliefs about food rewards or patch quality, shows to be detrimental to following individuals, but paradoxically may lead to increased group cohesion. In an era where there is a huge amount of animal foraging data collected, our model provides a systematic way to conceptualize and understand those data by uncovering hidden mechanisms underlying social foraging decisions.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Survival Model for Stripe Formation in Zebrafish Exhibits Turing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zebrafish have been used as a model organism in many areas of biology, including the study of pattern formation. The mean-field survival model is a coupled ODE system describing the expected evolution of chromatophores coordinating to form stripes in zebrafish. This paper presents analysis of the model focusing on parameters for the number of cells, length of distant-neighbor interactions, and rates related to birth and death of chromatophores. We derive the conditions on these parameters for a Turing bifurcation to occur and show that the model predicts patterns qualitatively similar to those in nature.
  In addition to answering questions about this particular model, this paper also serves as a case study for Turing analysis on coupled ODE systems. The qualitative behavior of such coupled ODE models may deviate significantly from continuum limit models. The ability to analyze such systems directly avoids this concern and allows for a more accurate description of the behavior at physically relevant scales.</description>
