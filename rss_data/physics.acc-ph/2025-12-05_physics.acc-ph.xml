      <title>High-repetition-rate, all-reflective optical guiding and electron acceleration in helium using an off-axis axicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent results on high-power guiding and laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the ELBA beamline at ELI Beamlines, using the L3-HAPLS laser system (13 J, 30 fs, 0.2 Hz). By employing self-waveguiding in a 20 cm plasma channel in helium, we achieved stable acceleration of electron beams to energies approaching 5 GeV. A novel all-reflective optical setup, including an off-axis reflective axicon, enabled efficient acceleration at 0.2 Hz and guiding at repetition rates up to 3.3 Hz. This compact single laser, single compressor implementation of plasma channels for electron acceleration stabilizes electron pointing and enhances energy gain without requiring modifications to the laser system, paving the way for broader adoption of the technology across user facilities.</description>

      <title>Operator Formalism for Laser-Plasma Wakefield Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an operator-based framework for laser--plasma wakefield acceleration (LPWA) in capillary discharges, providing a compact and systematic description of the coupled dynamics of laser fields and plasma response. The formalism employs key operators: the transverse modal operator $\hat{K}$, the nonlinear plasma operator $\hat{N}[\Psi]$, the plasma oscillation operator $\hat{\Omega}_p^{\,2}$, and the ponderomotive source operator $\hat{\alpha}$, which together describe mode coupling, plasma oscillations, and nonlinear feedback induced by the ponderomotive force. In the linear regime, the system is characterized by invariant subspaces associated with stable modal structures, while nonlinear interactions break these invariances, leading to mode mixing and complex dynamics. The approach establishes a direct connection between LPWA and Hilbert-space operator theory, including the invariant subspace, providing a formal mathematical interpretation of energy transfer and wakefield formation. Furthermore, the operator formalism integrates with neural operator methods, allowing efficient approximation of $\hat{N}$ and $\hat{\alpha}$ for reduced-order modeling and predictive control. This hybrid physics--AI framework offers a robust foundation for modeling, analysis, and optimization of high-intensity laser--plasma interactions in next-generation accelerator experiments.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Beam Dynamics Simulation of the RF Photoinjector Test Bench at JINR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present beam-dynamics simulations for an S-band RF photoinjector test bench under development at JINR, aimed at producing high-quality electron beams and enabling future generation of relativistic vortex electrons. Simulations of the 1.5-cell photogun under the presently available RF gradient of ~45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge forces are weak, and the transverse emittance is dominated by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and cathode-region solenoid yields a robust emittance-stabilization regime with a final normalized emittance of ~3.2 pi mm mrad. To assess prospects for accelerating structured electron beams, we additionally model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The results show that multi-MeV acceleration suppresses free-space spreading and preserves the wave-packet's initial OAM structure, indicating that the test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.</description>

      <title>Impact of local bunching factors in single-pass THz free electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In simulations for modern free-electron lasers (FEL), shot noise plays a crucial role. While it is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, shot noise is typically modeled using macroparticles, with their bunching factors corresponding to the bunching factors of the much larger number of electrons. For short-wavelength FELs, the macroparticles are assumed to be uniformly distributed on the scale of the resonant wavelength, since shot noise dominates the initial radiation - for instance, in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold at longer wavelengths, particularly in the THz range, where the bunch current profile is not uniform even within the length of the resonant wavelength. Instead, the current profile dominates the initial bunching factors, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than shot noise. The slice-based bunching factors and bunching phases are derived for Gaussian distributions and compared with shot noise under the assumption that the current within each slice remains constant. Using the THz FEL at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a case study, the influence of the current profile has been benchmarked through simulations under very low bunch charge, where the full number of electrons can be modeled using the Genesis1.3 code. Additional simulations with the nominal working parameters of PITZ THz FEL have been compared with experimental data, indicating better agreement when the actual current profile is taken into account.</description>
