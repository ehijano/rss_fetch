      <title>TorchSim: An efficient atomistic simulation engine in PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce TorchSim, an open-source atomistic simulation engine tailored for the Machine Learned Interatomic Potential (MLIP) era. By rewriting core atomistic simulation primitives in PyTorch, TorchSim can achieve orders of magnitude acceleration for popular MLIPs. Unlike existing molecular dynamics packages, which simulate one system at a time, TorchSim performs batched simulations that efficiently utilize modern GPUs by evolving multiple systems concurrently. TorchSim supports molecular dynamics integrators, structural relaxation optimizers, both machine-learned and classical interatomic potentials (such as Lennard-Jones, Morse, soft-sphere), batching with automatic memory management, differentiable simulation, and integration with popular materials informatics tools.</description>

      <title>How to simulate L\'evy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
  In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
  This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of L\'evy flights in steep potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>A hybrid electromechanical phase-field and deep learning framework for predicting fracture in dielectric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate and efficient prediction of crack propagation in dielectric materials is a critical challenge in structural health monitoring and the design of smart systems. This work presents a hybrid modeling framework that combines an electromechanical phase-field fracture model with deep learning-based surrogate modeling to predict fracture evolution in dielectric nanocomposite plates. The underlying finite element simulations capture the coupling between mechanical deformation and electrical field perturbations caused by cracks, using a variational phase-field formulation. High-fidelity simulation outputs - namely, phase-field damage variables and electric potential fields -- are used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ResNet-U-Net architectures for pixel-wise segmentation of crack paths. The study systematically compares the performance of CNNs trained on phase-field versus electric potential data across multiple ResNet backbones. The results reveal that electric potential fields, although they encode damage indirectly, offer superior segmentation accuracy, faster convergence, and enhanced generalization, owing to their smoother gradient distribution and global spatial coverage. The proposed framework significantly reduces computational costs while preserving high accuracy, offers potential when appropriately adapted for sensor-based input data.</description>

      <title>Development of a Novel Riemann Solver for Solid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new finite volume framework for solid dynamics based on a momentum-deformation formulation. Building on the C-TOUCH methodology [1], a novel Roe-type Riemann solver is developed to enhance the stability and accuracy of hyperbolic conservation law solutions in solids. The approach naturally handles multidimensional problems and provides a foundation for future extensions to nonlinear and fluid-structure interaction cases. Validation against standard two- and three-dimensional linear elasticity benchmarks demonstrates the method's robustness and accuracy relative to traditional displacement-based approaches, highlighting its promise for large-scale dynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Online Emulation for Accelerating Complex Physical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex physical simulations often require trade-offs between model fidelity and computational feasibility. We introduce Adaptive Online Emulation (AOE), which dynamically learns neural network surrogates during simulation execution to accelerate expensive components. Unlike existing methods requiring extensive offline training, AOE uses Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELMs) to continuously adapt emulators along the actual simulation trajectory. We employ a numerically stable variant of the OS-ELM using cumulative sufficient statistics to avoid matrix inversion instabilities. AOE integrates with time-stepping frameworks through a three-phase strategy balancing data collection, updates, and surrogate usage, while requiring orders of magnitude less training data than conventional surrogate approaches. Demonstrated on a 1D atmospheric model of exoplanet GJ1214b, AOE achieves 11.1 times speedup (91% time reduction) across 200,000 timesteps while maintaining accuracy, potentially making previously intractable high-fidelity time-stepping simulations computationally feasible.</description>

      <title>Reproducing and Extending Brownian Motion in Optical Trap: A Computational Reimplementation of Volpe and Volpe (2013)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a re-representation and independent simulation of the model introduced by Giorgio Volpe and Giovanni Volpe in their 2013 study of a Brownian particle in an optical trap (Volpe and Volpe, 2013). Rather than duplicating their original plots, we reconstructed the simulations from first principles using Python, implementing stochastic differential equations via finite difference schemes. This work reproduces and validates the key physical regimes described in the original article, including the transition from ballistic to diffusive motion, optical confinement, and velocity autocorrelations. To simulate rotational forces (Grier, 2003) and Kramers transitions (Haenggi et al., 1990), we also extend the analysis to include force perturbations, rotational fields, Kramers transitions, and stochastic resonance. The simulations provide pedagogical insight into stochastic dynamics and numerical modeling, reinforcing the original study's value as a teaching and research tool in statistical and computational physics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing cluster synchronization in phase-lagged multilayer networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster synchronization in multilayer networks of phase oscillators with phase-lag poses significant challenges due to the destabilizing effects of delayed interactions. Leveraging the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model, this study addresses these challenges by systematically exploring the role of natural frequency distributions in sustaining cluster synchronization under high phase-lag conditions. We focus on four distributions: uniform (uni-uni), partially degree-correlated (deg-uni, uni-deg), and fully degree-correlated (deg-deg), where oscillators' intrinsic frequencies align with their network connectivity. Through numerical and analytical investigations, we demonstrate that the deg-deg distribution, where both layers employ degree-matched frequencies, remarkably enhances synchronization stability, outperforming other configurations. We analyze two distinct network architectures: one composed entirely of nontrivial clusters and another combining trivial and nontrivial clusters. Results reveal that structural heterogeneity encoded in the deg-deg coupling counteracts phase-lag-induced desynchronization, enabling robust cluster synchronization even at large phase-lag values. Stability is rigorously validated via transverse Lyapunov exponents (TLEs), which confirm that deg-deg networks exhibit broader synchronization regimes compared to uniform or partially correlated systems. These findings provide critical insights into the interplay between topological heterogeneity and dynamical resilience, offering a framework for designing robust multilayer systems from delay-tolerant power grids to adaptive biological networks, where synchronization under phase-lag is paramount.</description>

      <title>Engineering snags for spatial curvature in weaves: Fabrication, mechanics, and inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weaving as an old craft has extensive applications in modern science and technology such as smart textiles and intelligent soft robots. However, weaving irregular curved surfaces has been difficult, with prior alternatives requiring curved ribbons and triaxial weaving patterns. In this work, we present a simple strategy to achieve complex spatial curvature by purposely introducing 'snags', a traditionally unwanted textile defect, into dense plain weaves consisting of straight ribbons assembled in a straightforward biaxial network. We detail the fabrication methodology where we pull out ribbons of initially smooth two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) plain weaves to form local snags. We show that these local defects cause global curvatures through the propagation of geometric frustration. We then use a reduced-order bar &amp; hinge model to simulate the mechanics-guided deformation of snagged plain weaves, and we investigate how the curvature scales with system parameters such as the thickness and Young's modulus of the ribbons. Finally, we introduce an inverse design platform where an evolutionary algorithm is used to inversely compute the optimal snag patterns of smooth plain weaves to approximate arbitrary target surfaces including 2D and 3D woven exoskeletons that fit human legs and elbows, respectively. Engineering snags in plain weaves as a general strategy can pave the way for future design of customizable wearable devices, adaptive soft robots, reconfigurable architecture, and more.</description>

      <title>Exploiting repeated matrix block structures for more efficient CFD on modern supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides. This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation. Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence, gradient, and Laplacian.</description>

      <title>An RBC-MsUQ Framework for Red Blood Cell Morpho-Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the morpho-mechanical properties of red blood cells (RBCs) is crucial for understanding microvascular transport mechanisms and cellular pathophysiological processes, yet current computational models are constrained by multi-source uncertainties including cross-platform experimental discrepancies and parameter identification stochasticity. We present RBC-MsUQ, a novel multi-stage uncertainty quantification framework tailored for RBCs. It integrates hierarchical Bayesian inference with diverse experimental datasets, establishing prior distributions for RBC parameters via microscopic simulations and literature-derived data. A dynamic annealing technique defines stress-free baselines, while deep neural network surrogates, optimized through sensitivity analysis, achieve sub-10$^{-2}$ prediction errors for efficient simulation approximation. Its two-stage hierarchical inference architecture constrains geometric and shear modulus parameters using stress-free state and stretching data in Stage I and enables full-parameter identification via membrane fluctuation and relaxation tests in Stage II. Applied to healthy and malaria-infected RBCs, the RBC-MsUQ framework produces statistically robust posterior distributions, revealing increased stiffness and viscosity in pathological cells. Quantitative model-experiment validation demonstrates that RBC-MsUQ effectively mitigates uncertainties through cross-platform data fusion, overcoming the critical limitations of existing computational approaches. The RBC-MsUQ framework thus provides a systematic paradigm for studying RBC properties and advancing cellular mechanics and biomedical engineering.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Digital Twins via Conditional Neural Whitney Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for constructing real-time digital twins based on structure-preserving reduced finite element models conditioned on a latent variable Z. The approach uses conditional attention mechanisms to learn both a reduced finite element basis and a nonlinear conservation law within the framework of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC). This guarantees numerical well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics, and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations), including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES. An open-source implementation is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Discovery Learning accelerates battery design evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.</description>

      <title>Giant spin Hall effects and topological surface states in ternary-layered MAX carbides Mn+1AlCn (M= Nb, Ta, n=1, 2, 3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a systematic study of the electronic structures, band topology, and intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) of the layered MAX carbides Mn+1AlCn (M= Nb, Ta, n=1, 2, 3) and explore the correlation effects on the SHE. The results show that M3AlC2 and M4AlC3 (M= Nb, Ta) share similar Dirac-band-crossing features near the Fermi level (EF) and form nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). When the SOC is included, the Dirac band crossings are fully gapped, resulting in nontrivial Z2 topological invariants (1;000) with a pair of surface states on the (001) plane. Remarkably, the multiple gapped Dirac points contribute to locally strong spin Berry curvatures, which lead to large spin Hall conductivities and a giant spin Hall angle up to ~ 60% for Ta3AlC2. Moreover, we also elucidate the impact of Hubbard U correction on SHC. Our findings indicate that Ta3AlC2 might represent an intriguing layered Z2 topological metal with superior charge-to-spin conversion efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of nonequilibrium gas flows spanning multiple flow regimes is challenging due to the breakdown of scale separation. In this work, we propose a kinetic framework that captures the transport of molecules under varying collision behaviors within a given observation timescale $h$. Within this framework, gas molecules in the system are classified into three types over the time interval $0\le t&lt;h$, namely, collided molecules that have experienced collisions with other molecules, free-transport molecules that encounter no collisions during $[0,h]$, and transitional molecules which encounter no collisions during $[0, t]$ but collide with other molecules during $[t,h]$. Then three coupled sub-kinetic equations for different types of molecules are developed rigorously through the formal solution of the Boltzmann equation. The asymptotic behaviors of the three sub-kinetic equations are analyzed, and it is shown that the system presents a framework for describing the exchange among the molecules with different collision behaviors. Beyond enabling variable-scale kinetic modeling, this framework can provide a basis for developing efficient numerical methods for simulating multiscale gas flows. Importantly, due to its intrinstic mutiscale nature, the proposed framework may also offer new insights into Hillbert's sixth problem.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Reaction Coordinate Optimization with Histories: A Framework for Rare Event Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding, chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics. Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general, flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and longitudinal datasets.</description>

      <title>Beam-Beam Fields with Full Six-Dimensional Coupling: Theory and Computational Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a generalized theoretical framework for calculating beam-beam fields induced by a Gaussian beam with full six-dimensional coupling. We also develop computational techniques for evaluating these fields. A case study based on the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) electron storage ring illustrates the practical application of the framework. Our results suggest that the standard slice model for the beam-beam kick can significantly underestimate the longitudinal field. The proposed theory may provide a foundation for developing improved simulation models and guiding future design studies.</description>

      <title>An implicit gas-kinetic scheme for internal and external flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas-kinetic scheme(GKS) is a promising computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It is based on the analytical solution of the BGK equation, which enables accurate and robust simulations. While GKS has demonstrated excellent properties (e.g., unified treatment of inviscid and viscous fluxes, inherent adaptive dissipation control), its application to classical engineering problems, such as aerodynamic flows and fluid machinery, remains underdeveloped compared to conventional CFD methods. This study bridges this gap by advancing GKS capabilities for real-world engineering challenges. First, the GKS is extended to a rotating coordinate frame, enabling efficient simulations of internal flows in turbomachinery. Second, the computational inefficiency of explicit GKS is addressed through an implicit time discretization using the generalized minimal residual method. The Jacobian matrices for inviscid/viscous fluxes are approximated using the first-order kinetic flux vector splitting scheme and the thin shear layer approximation to enhance robustness and computational efficiency further. Third, the shear-stress transport turbulence model is coupled to expand GKS's applicability to industrial turbulent flows. Numerical tests, including internal compressor rotor flow and external flow over a 3-D wingbody, validate the proposed method's accuracy and efficiency. Via our implicit scheme, the force coefficients of the 3-D wing-body flow with about five million mesh elements can converge after 500 steps. This work represents a practical advancement of GKS, demonstrating its potential to compete with established CFD solvers in high-Reynolds-number external and internal turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>QVNTVS, Open-Source Quantum Well Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Wells (QW) are of great importance in optoelectronic devices such as LEDs and LASERs, being the emissive layers.Simulating the quantum particles in different QW topologies like rectangular finite potential wells, multiple potential wells, and triangular biased potential well heterojunctions enables faster modeling, theoretical characterization, and more. QVNTVS performs energy level and wavefunction calculations, recombination probability, transition energy, and optical emission computations quickly and accurately. Contrasting with the existing simulators, QVNTVS is an open-source project and can produce solutions for niche problems like potential wells under an electric field, heterojunctions, recombination, and transition matrices. QVNTVS simulates QWs by solving the Time-Independent Schr\"odinger Equation for different potential profiles in a discretized space using the finite-difference method and computes the properties of the device using the extracted information from the solution. The results align with the analytical calculations and the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Order and Li$_x$TM$_{4-x}$ Probability Maps for Disordered Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-range order (SRO) in the cation-disordered state is a controlling factor influencing the probability of finding Li$_{4}$ tetrahedron clusters in disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. However, the prevalent Li$_4$ probability below the random limit across reported DRX compositions has not been systematically investigated, active strategies to surpass the random limit of Li$_4$ probability are lacking, and the fundamental ordering behavior on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice remains insufficiently explored. This research quantitatively examines pair SRO parameters and Li$_x$TM$_{4-x}$ probabilities via exhaustive Monte Carlo mapping across a simplified subset of the parameter space. The results indicate that, in the disordered state, the Li$_4$ probability is governed by the nearest neighbor (NN) pair-wise SRO parameter, and that these quantities do not necessarily represent a simple attenuation of their corresponding low-temperature long-range order, particularly for the important cases of Layered and Spinel-like orderings. Strategies are proposed to mitigate or even reverse the lithium and transition metals mixing tendency of NN pair SRO to achieve Li$_4$ probabilities that exceed the random limit. This study advances the fundamental thermodynamic understanding of ordering behaviors, which can be generalized to any FCC system.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian method for solving the spherical shallow water equations using power diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of the air in the atmosphere and water in the oceans are essential for numerical weather prediction. The state-of-the-art for performing these fluid simulations relies on an Eulerian viewpoint, in which the fluid domain is discretized into a mesh, and the governing equations describe the fluid motion as it passes through each cell of the mesh. However, it is unclear whether a Lagrangian viewpoint, in which the fluid is discretized by a collection of particles, can outperform Eulerian simulations in global atmospheric simulations. To date, Lagrangian approaches have shown promise, but tend to produce smoother solutions. In this work, a new Lagrangian method is developed to simulate the atmosphere in which particles are represented with spherical power cells. We introduce an efficient algorithm for computing these cells which are then used to discretize the spherical shallow water equations. Mass conservation is enforced by solving a semi-discrete optimal transport problem and a semi-implicit time stepping procedure is used to advance the solution in time. We note that, in contrast to previous work, artificial viscosity is not needed to stabilize the simulation. The performance of the spherical Voronoi diagram calculation is first assessed, which shows that spherical Voronoi diagrams of 100 million sites can be computed in under 2 minutes on a single machine. The new simulation method is then evaluated on standard benchmark test cases, which shows that momentum and energy conservation of this new method is comparable to the latest Lagrangian approach for simulating the spherical shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Fast and efficient long-distance quantum state transfer in long-range spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling scheme in long spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ linear chains. Exploiting the properties of the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that with minimal engineering, i.e., an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average transfer fidelity above $99\%$ can be achieved. To leading order, the required time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to longer range coupling schemes.</description>

      <title>A Set of Tutorials for the LAMMPS Simulation Package</title>

Abstract: The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Clamonds solution of the Colebrook-White equation: highest accuracy for engineering purposes with one iteration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Colebrook-White equation is the widely used basis for the calculation of the friction factor lambda for flows in pipes and ducts. Because this equation is implicit in lambda, many solutions have been developed to ease the calculation in order to reduce the effort and to reach a sufficient accuracy. Clamond has proposed in 2008 an iterative solution that requires maximally two iterations to obtain the machine double precision. Here an improvement of this solution is presented, that achieves already with one iteration a maximal error of 2.79E-7, what is more than sufficient for most engineering purposes. This solution is compared in a chart of CPU time versus accuracy with 28 solutions from the literature and in the group of the fastest solutions, that require only two calls of the logarithm function, it proved to be by far the most accurate one.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN: A Scalable Graph Neural Network Framework with Hierarchical Matrix Acceleration for Simulation of Large-Scale Particulate Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast and scalable framework, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) and hierarchical matrix ($\mathcal{H}$-matrix) techniques, for simulating large-scale particulate suspensions, which have broader impacts across science and engineering. The framework draws on the Hydrodynamic Interaction Graph Neural Network (HIGNN) that employs GNNs to model the mobility tensor governing particle motion under hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) and external forces. HIGNN offers several advantages: it effectively captures both short- and long-range HIs and their many-body nature; it realizes a substantial speedup over traditional methodologies, by requiring only a forward pass through its neural networks at each time step; it provides explainability beyond black-box neural network models, through direct correspondence between graph connectivity and physical interactions; and it demonstrates transferability across different systems, irrespective of particles' number, concentration, configuration, or external forces. While HIGNN provides significant speedup, the quadratic scaling of its overall prediction cost (with respect to the total number of particles), due to intrinsically slow-decaying two-body HIs, limits its scalability. To achieve superior efficiency across all scales, in the present work we integrate $\mathcal{H}$-matrix techniques into HIGNN, reducing the prediction cost scaling to quasi-linear. Through comprehensive evaluations, we validate $\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN's accuracy, and demonstrate its quasi-linear scalability and superior computational efficiency. It requires only minimal computing resources; for example, a single mid-range GPU is sufficient for a system containing 10 million particles. Finally, we demonstrate $\mathcal{H}$-HIGNN's ability to efficiently simulate practically relevant large-scale suspensions of both particles and flexible filaments.</description>

      <title>A modern Fortran library for SU(3) coupling and recoupling coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ has applications in several branches of physics. Many of these applications depend on availability of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ coupling and recoupling coefficients. We have developed a modern Fortran library for calculation of the coupling coefficients, for both the $\mathrm{SU}(3)\supset\mathrm{U}(1)\times\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)\supset\mathrm{SO}(3)$ group chains, and the recoupling coefficients. The library implements the algorithms of Draayer, Akiyama, and Millener, which are laid out in the paper. Performance of the library has been tested and compared to the Akiyama-Draayer (AD) library implementing the same algorithms as well as to a more recent implementation. Our library works for a larger range of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ quantum numbers and provides more accurate coupling coefficients with large quantum numbers than the AD library.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex physical process prevalent in modern physics, particularly in ionized environments like interstellar gas, where magnetic fields play a dynamic role. However, the precise influence of magnetic fields in such settings remains unclear. We employ the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number, ${M}_{\mathrm{A}} = \sqrt{E_{\mathrm{k}}/E_{\mathrm{B}}}$, to gauge the magnetic field's significance relative to turbulent motion, uncovering diverse interaction patterns. In the low-${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ magnetic regime, the field is force-free, yet gas motion does not align with it. At intermediate ${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ (magnetic-kinetic transition regime), velocity and magnetic fields show peak alignment, likely due to rapid relaxation. In the high-${M}_{\mathrm{A}}$ kinetic regime, both fields are irregular and unaligned. These regimes find observational counterparts in interstellar gas, highlighting the multifaceted nature of MHD turbulence and aiding future astrophysical interpretations.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

Abstract: We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude for systems of 50 qubits, although our method is also applicable to larger systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Accurate and thermodynamically consistent hydrogen equation of state for planetary modeling with flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10594</link>

Abstract: Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. This allows us to conclusively address the long-standing discrepancies in Jupiter's adiabat among earlier studies, demonstrating the potential of our approach for providing reliable equations of state of diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.</description>

      <title>PFD: Automatically Generating Machine Learning Force Fields from Universal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD, which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</description>

      <title>Tensor Learning and Compression of N-phonon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with &gt;98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn and monoclinic ZrO$_2$). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting steady hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction, U-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%. Similarly, the performance of U-ResNet for wall shear stress (NMAE: 0.56%), velocity (NMAE: 1.06%), and vorticity (NMAE: 0.69%) consistently surpasses alternative architectures. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a 180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30 minutes to 10 seconds per case. The model with non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising auxiliary tool to complement CFD simulations for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization. Future work will focus on extending the framework to three-dimensional geometries and integrating it with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Gaussian basis sets for many-body systems using Rothe's method: A mean-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A challenge in modeling time-dependent strong-field processes such as high-harmonic generation for many-body systems, is how to effectively represent the electronic continuum. We apply Rothe's method to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and density functional theory (TDDFT) equations of motion for the orbitals, which reformulates them as an optimization problem. We show that thawed, complex-valued Gaussian basis sets can be propagated efficiently for these orbital-based approaches, removing the need for grids. In particular, we illustrate that qualitatively correct results can often be obtained by using just a few fully flexible Gaussians that describe the unbound dynamics for both TDHF and TDDFT. Grid calculations can be reproduced quantitatively using $30$--$100$ Gaussians for intensities up to $4\times10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ for the one-dimensional molecular systems considered in this work.</description>

      <title>A generalized ENO reconstruction in compact GKS for compressible flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized ENO (GENO)-type nonlinear reconstruction scheme for compressible flow simulations. The proposed reconstruction preserves the accuracy of the linear scheme while maintaining essentially non-oscillatory behavior at discontinuities. By generalizing the adaptive philosophy of ENO schemes, the method employs a smooth path function that directly connects high-order linear reconstruction with a reliable lower-order alternative. This direct adaptive approach significantly simplifies the construction of nonlinear schemes, particularly for very high-order methods on unstructured meshes. A comparative analysis with various WENO methods demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of the proposed reconstruction, which provides an optimal transition between linear and nonlinear reconstructions across all limiting cases based on stencil smoothness. The consistency and performance of the GENO reconstruction are validated through implementation in both high-order compact gas-kinetic schemes (GKS) and non-compact Riemann-solver-based methods. Benchmark tests confirm the robustness and shock-capturing capabilities of GENO, with particularly superior performance when integrated with compact schemes. This work advances the construction methodology of nonlinear schemes and establishes ENO-type reconstruction as a mature and practical approach for engineering applications.</description>
