      <title>Constraining the major merger history of $z \sim 3-9$ galaxies using JADES: dominant in-situ star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of galaxy close-pair fractions and major merger rates to evaluate the importance of mergers in the hierarchical growth of galaxies over cosmic time. This study focuses on the previously poorly understood redshift range of $z \approx 3-9$ using JADES observations. Our mass-complete sample includes primary galaxies with stellar masses of ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, having major companions (mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) selected by $5-30$ pkpc projected separation and redshift proximity criteria. Pair fractions are measured using a statistically robust method incorporating photometric redshift posteriors and available spectroscopic data. The pair fraction evolves steeply with redshift, peaking at $z \sim 5-6$, followed by a turnover, and shows dependence on the stellar mass: the pair fraction peaks at later cosmic times (lower redshifts) for more massive galaxies. Similarly, the derived galaxy major merger rate increases and flattens beyond $z \sim 6$ to $2-10~{\rm Gyr^{-1}}$ per galaxy, showing a weak scaling with stellar mass, driven by the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function. A comparison between the cumulative mass accretion from major mergers and the mass assembled through star formation indicates that major mergers contribute approximately $5-14\%$ to the total mass growth over the studied redshift range, which is in agreement with the ex-situ mass fraction estimated from our simple numerical model. These results highlight that major mergers contribute little to the direct stellar mass growth compared to in-situ star formation but could still play an indirect role by driving star formation itself.</description>

      <title>Cosmic quenching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quenching of star formation activity represents a critical phase for a non-negligible fraction of the observed galaxy population at all cosmic epochs, marking a transition from an epoch of intense mass growth to an extended period of passive evolution. Over the past years, we have collected a detailed characterization of how the fraction of quenched galaxies evolves as a function of cosmic time (it grows at later cosmic epochs), and correlates with the physical properties of galaxies (more massive galaxies, that also tend to be bulge-dominated, are more likely to be quenched) and with their environment (denser environments host larger fractions of quiescent galaxies). Different physical processes can lead to a suppression of star formation. These include internal processes (processes that do not depend on the environment in which galaxies live, e.g. stellar and AGN feedback mechanisms) and processes that instead depend on the environment (e.g. mergers, gas stripping processes). In this chapter, we summarize the observational and theoretical status of the field, highlighting the most recent results and the questions that are yet to be answered. We also summarize our view on the expected developments in the next few years.</description>

      <title>Pearls on a string: Dark and bright galaxies on a strikingly straight and narrow filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a chain of galaxies along an almost straight line in the nearby Universe with a projected length of ~5 Mpc. The galaxies are distributed within projected distances of only 7-105 kpc from the axis of the identified filament. They have redshifts in a very small range of z=0.0361-0.0370 so that their radial velocities are consistent with galaxy proper motions. The filament galaxies are mainly star-forming and have stellar masses in a range of $\rm 10^{9.1}-10^{10.7}\,M_{\odot}$. We search for systems with similar geometrical properties in the full-sky mock galaxy catalogue of the MillenniumTNG simulations and find that although such straight filaments are unusual and rare, they are predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations (4% incidence). We study the cold HI gas in a 1.3 Mpc section of the filament through HI-21cm emission line observations and detect eleven HI sources, many more than expected from the HI mass function in a similar volume. They have HI masses $\rm 10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$ and are mostly within ~120 kpc projected distance from the filament axis. None of these HI sources has a confirmed optical counterpart. Their darkness together with their large HI-21cm line-widths indicate that they contain gas that might not yet be virialized. These clouds must be marking the peaks of the dark matter and HI distributions over large scales within the filament. The presence of such gas clouds around the filament spines is predicted by simulations, but this is the first time that the existence of such clouds in a filament is observationally confirmed.</description>

      <title>Stars as cosmic scales: measuring stellar mass with microlensed supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a unique probe of the stellar content in strong lens galaxies. Flux ratio anomalies from gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe), just like lensed quasars, can be used to constrain the stellar mass fractions at the image positions. Type Ia supernovae are of particular interest as knowledge of the intrinsic source brightness helps constrain the amount of (de)magnification from the macromodel predictions that might be due to microlensing. In addition, the presence or absence of caustic crossings in the light curves of glSNe can be used to constrain the mass of the microlenses. We find that a sample of 50 well-modeled glSNe Ia systems with single epoch observations at peak intrinsic supernova luminosity should be able to constrain a stellar mass-to-light ratio to within $\sim 15\%$. A set of systems with light curve level information providing the location (or absence) of caustic crossing events can also constrain the mass of the microlenses to within $\sim 50\%$. Much work is needed to make such a measurement in practice, but our results demonstrate the feasibility of microlensing to place constraints on astrophysical parameters related to the initial mass function of lensing galaxies without any prior assumptions on the stellar mass.</description>

      <title>The $Hubble$ Missing Globular Cluster Survey. I. Survey overview and the first precise age estimate for ESO452-11 and 2MASS-GC01</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the $Hubble$ Missing Globular Cluster Survey (MGCS), a $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ treasury programme dedicated to the observation of all the kinematically confirmed Milky Way globular clusters that missed previous $Hubble$ imaging. After introducing the aims of the programme and describing its target clusters, we showcase the first results of the survey. These are related to two clusters, one located at the edge of the Milky Way Bulge and observed in optical bands, namely ESO452-11, and one located in the Galactic Disc observed in the near-IR, namely 2MASS-GC01. For both clusters, the deep colour-magnitude diagrams obtained from the MGCS observations reach several magnitudes below their main-sequence turn-off, and thus enable the first precise estimate of their age. By using the methods developed within the CARMA project, we find ESO452-11 to be an old, metal-intermediate globular cluster, with ${\rm [M/H]}\simeq-0.80^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ and an age of ${\rm t}=13.59^{+0.48}_{-0.69}$ Gyr. Its location on the age-metallicity relation makes it consistent with an in-situ origin, in agreement with its dynamical properties. On the other hand, the results for 2MASS-GC01 highlight it as a young, metal-intermediate cluster, with an age of ${\rm t}=7.22^{+0.93}_{-1.11}$ Gyr at ${\rm [M/H]}=-0.73^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$. This is the first ever age estimate for this extremely extincted cluster, and indicates it either as the youngest globular known to date, or as a massive and compact open cluster, which is consistent with its almost circular, disc-like orbit.</description>

      <title>Constraining the geometry of the gas surrounding a typical galaxy at $z = 3.4$ with Ly$\alpha$ polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ emission is the strongest tracer of recombining ionized hydrogen in young, star-forming galaxies, but its origin is still debated. Ly$\alpha$ arises when emitted photons scatter in neutral hydrogen and, so far, observational efforts have mostly focused on the Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness and spectral profile, which depend on the neutral hydrogen column density, geometry, kinematics, powering mechanism and on the region from which the photons are emitted. Different processes produce similar spectra, but have different degrees of polarization, that we can use to discriminate between them. In this paper, we present the first spectropolarimetric observations of a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\sim 3.4$, strongly lensed by the cluster of galaxies Abell 2895, taken with the PMOS mode of the VLT/FORS2 instrument. We measure a Ly$\alpha$ degree of polarization $1\sigma$ upper limit of $4.6\%$. We develop new Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer models to reproduce the observations, that can be explained by assuming the star-forming galaxy being embedded in a CGM with a biconical outflow geometry, with an opening angle of the wind $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 30^\circ$ for line-of-sight angles $\theta_{LOS} \leq 20^\circ$, $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 45^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 20^\circ$, $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 60^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 20^\circ$, and $\theta_{o,Wind}\sim 75^\circ$ for $\theta_{LOS}\leq 40^\circ$, where $\theta_{LOS}=0^\circ$ means observing in the direction of the outflow. We notice that the constraints from polarization are complementary to those from the spectral line profile. This study shows the potential of adding measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ degree of polarization to constrain the geometry of the gas surrounding typical star-forming galaxies and paves the way to spatially resolved studies that will allow us to disentangle between different Ly$\alpha$ origin mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of AGN outflows and their origin with the 23 m Large Binocular Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a key component of galaxy evolution due to feedback on the host from its supermassive black hole. The morphology of warm, in- and outflowing dusty material can reveal the nature of the onset of feedback, AGN feeding, and the unified model of AGN. Here we use the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) to image the dense, obscuring disk and extended dusty outflow region of NGC 1068. In Fizeau imaging mode the LBTI synthesizes the equivalent resolution of a 22.8 m telescope. The 8.7 $\mu$m Fizeau images of NGC 1068 {have an effective resolution of $47\times90$ mas ($3.3\times6.2$ pc)} in a 5" field of view after performing PSF deconvolution techniques described here. This is the only extragalactic source to be Fizeau imaged using the LBTI, and the images bridge the scales measured with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI; 0.5-5 pc) and those of single telescopes such as JWST and Keck ($&gt;15$ pc). The images detect and spatially resolve the low surface brightness mid-infrared (MIR) features in the AGN disk/wind region that are over-resolved by the VLTI. The images show strong correlation between MIR dust emission and near-infrared (NIR) emission of highly excited atomic lines observed by SINFONI. Such LBTI imaging is a precursor to infrared imaging using the upcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, with angular resolutions up to 6x better than JWST, the largest space telescope in orbit.</description>

      <title>Central Cluster Galaxies: A Hotspot for Detectable Gravitational Waves from Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model continuous gravitational wave (CW) sources detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), using the ASTRID cosmological simulation. The most detectable single sources are in the low-frequency bins and are produced by the most supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers (with M_BH ~ 10^10 - 10^11 solarmass) in the most massive galaxies M_star ~ 10^12 solarmass. Remarkably, these mergers (mostly at z&lt; 0.3) occur within massive galaxies residing at the center of galaxy clusters. Particularly striking in ASTRID is a triple merger event, where two subsequent mergers in the same cluster core generate high-detection-probability CW signals at ~ 2nHz and ~ 10nHz. We expect electromagnetic signatures from these events: either single or dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and massive host galaxies that are undergoing significant star formation. We establish a novel connection between these high-mass, central cluster mergers, occurring in galaxies with active star formation and AGN, and the formation process of the central cluster galaxy in ASTRID. This provides new insights into the low-frequency gravitational wave sky and informs future multi-messenger searches for PTA CW sources.</description>

      <title>ADF22-WEB: ALMA and JWST (sub)kpc-scale views of dusty star-forming galaxies in a $z\approx$3 proto-cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a morphological analysis of ALMA and JWST NIRCam images of nine dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at zspec=3.09, all embedded within the cosmic web filaments at the SSA22 proto-cluster core. The ALMA 870um and 1.1mm images are obtained at spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5" to 0.05" (350 pc at z=3.09). The high-resolution images enable us to resolve inner structures traced by dust continuum, identifying compact dusty cores, clumps, and offset ridges within bars. Sersic profile fit was performed for both ALMA 870um and NIRCam F444W images at comparable resolutions (0.15"). The Sersic index measured for 870um, masking bright regions, indicates values close to unity, suggesting that dust emission arises from disks with superimposed compact core components. For the JWST F444W images (restframe 1um), the Sersic indices range between nF444W = 1-3, pointing to the coexistence of bulges and stellar disks in these DSFGs. A comparison of dust mass surface density, nF444W, and F200W-F444W color (restframe 0.5-1um) reveals diversity among the DSFGs, likely reflecting different evolutionary stages including some DSFGs with red cores, indicating ongoing rapid bulge growth phases heavily obscured by dust. The predominantly disk-like morphologies observed in most DSFGs in the proto-cluster core contrast sharply with early-type morphologies that dominate the highest density environment in the local universe. This suggests that we are witnessing the early formation of the morphology-density relation, as massive galaxies undergo rapid growth as late-type galaxies fueled by cosmic web gas filaments.</description>

      <title>Turbulent gas-rich discs at high redshift: origin of thick stellar discs through 3D 'baryon sloshing'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions ($f_{\rm gas} = 0-100\%$). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, $\Phi_{\rm tot}$. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with $f_{\rm gas}$. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential ($f_{\rm gas}=100$%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to $R\approx 5$ kpc and $\vert z\vert \approx 1$ kpc within $\Phi_{\rm tot}(R,\phi,z)$. Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter ($f_{\rm disc}\gtrsim 50$%) within $R_s=2.2 R_{\rm disc}$, where $R_{\rm disc}$ is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower $f_{\rm disc}$ and/or $f_{\rm gas}$, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in $\vert z\vert$ due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does $not$ produce thick stellar discs.</description>

      <title>A Dual Active Black Hole Candidate with Mass Ratio ~7:1 in a Disk Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with comparable masses are commonly witnessed among the major merged galaxies with interaction remnants. Considering almost every massive galaxy is associated with multiple dwarf satellites around it, minor mergers involving galaxies with disproportional stellar masses should be much more common than major mergers, which would naturally lead to black hole (BH) pairs with significantly different masses. However, dual AGNs generated by minor mergers involving one or two dwarf galaxies are exceptionally rare and understudied. Moreover, good estimates of the masses of both BHs are not yet available to test this idea. Here we report the evidence of a dual AGN candidate with mass ratio $\sim$7:1 located in an undisturbed disk galaxy. We identify the central BH with mass of $9.4 \times 10^6M_\odot$ from its radio emission as well as AGN-driven galactic-scale biconical outflows. The off-centered BH generates obvious broad and narrow emission-line regions, which gives us a robust estimation of a $1.3 \times 10^6M_\odot$ BH mass. We explore alternative scenarios for explaining the observational features of this system, including the complex gas kinematics triggered by central AGN activity and dust attenuation of the broad-line region of the central BH, finding that they failed to fully account for the kinematics of both the redshifted off-centered broad and narrow emission-line components.</description>

      <title>Resolved Stellar Mass Estimation of Nearby Late-type Galaxies for the SPHEREx Era: Dependence on Stellar Population Synthesis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming all-sky infrared spectrophotometric SPHEREx mission is set to provide spatially resolved stellar mass maps of nearby galaxies, offering more detailed insights than integrated light observations. In this study, we develop a strategy for estimating stellar mass using SPHEREx by examining the dependence on different stellar population synthesis (SPS) models and proposing new scaling relations based on simulated SPHEREx data. We estimate the resolved stellar masses of 19 nearby late-type galaxies from the PHANGS-MUSE survey, treating these as fiducial masses. By testing four SPS models covering infrared wavelengths, i.e., E-MILES, Bruzual \&amp; Charlot 2003 (BC03), Charlot \&amp; Bruzual 2019 (CB19), and FSPS, we find systematic differences in mass-to-light ratios at $3.6~{\rm \mu m}$ ($M_{\ast}/L_{\rm 3.6\mu m}$) among the SPS models. In particular, BC03 and CB19 yield mass-to-light ratios on average $\sim0.2-0.3~{\rm dex}$ lower than those from E-MILES and FSPS. These mass-to-light ratios strongly correlate with stellar age, indicating a significant impact of young stellar populations on stellar mass measurements. Our analysis, incorporating fiducial masses and simulated SPHEREx data, identifies the $1.6~{\rm \mu m}$ band as the optimal wavelength for stellar mass estimation, with the lowest scatter ($0.15-0.20~{\rm dex}$) of the stellar mass. This scatter can be further reduced to $0.10-0.12~{\rm dex}$ across all SPS models by incorporating optical and SPHEREx colors. These results can provide guidance for measuring the stellar masses of the numerous nearby galaxies that SPHEREx will survey.</description>

      <title>Insight into the physical processes that shape the metallicity profiles in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of chemical elements in the star-forming regions can store information on the chemical enrichment history of the galaxies. Negative metallicity gradients are expected in galaxies forming inside-out. However, observations show that the metallicity profiles can be broken. We aim to study the diversity of metallicity profiles that can arise in the current cosmological context and compare them with available observations. We also seek to identify the physical processes responsible for breaks in metallicity profiles by using two galaxies as case studies. We analyze central galaxies from the cosmological simulations of the CIELO project, within the stellar mass range [$10^{8.5}$, $10^{10.5}$] M$_\odot$ at $z=0$. A new algorithm, DB-A, was developed to fit multiple power laws to the metallicity profiles, enabling a flexible assessment of metallicity gradients in various galactic regions. The simulations include detailed modeling of gas, metal-dependent cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. At $z=0$, we find diverse profile shapes, including inner and outer drops and rises, with some galaxies exhibiting double breaks. Gradient values align with observations. A temporal analysis of Local Group analogs shows inner and outer breaks occurring at all cosmic times, with outer breaks being more frequent. Metallicity gradients show high variability at high redshift, transitioning to mild evolution at lower redshift. Most inner breaks show central oxygen enhancement, linked to gas accretion and star formation. Inner drops result from disrupted gas due to feedback-driven outflows. Outer breaks with high metallicities arise from re-accreted material, extended star formation, and CGM-driven gas mixing. Outer drops are common at high redshift, linked to metal-poor gas accretion from cold flows. We highlight the complex interplay of these processes which often act together.</description>

      <title>Reevaluation of ALMA detection of circumstellar PH3 in the AGB envelope IRC+10216: evidence for misidentification with HCN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article "Confirmation of interstellar phosphine towards asymptotic giant branch star IRC+10216" by A. Manna and S. Pal uses ALMA data of the C-star envelope IRC+10216 to claim a confirmation of the detection of PH3 in this source. The article however incorrectly assign an emission feature observed in the ALMA spectrum of IRC+10216 to PH3, while we find that it arises from a highly vibrationally excited state of HCN. Concretely the feature can be confidently assigned to the J=3-2 l=0 transition of HCN in the v1+4v2 vibrational state based on the observation of the l=+2 and l=-2 components of the same rotational transition, J=3-2, with the observed relative intensities in agreement with the relative line strengths. The detection of PH3 in IRC+10216 remains confirmed based on the observation of the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines with the single-dish telescopes IRAM-30m, ARO SMT-10m, and Herschel (Agundez et al. 2008, 2014; Tenenbaum et al. 2008).</description>

      <title>Building on the archives: Connecting the CN/CO intensity ratio with global galaxy properties in nearby U/LIRGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the CN/CO intensity ratio to obtain the dense gas fraction, $f_{\text{dense}}$, for a sample of 16 Ultra-luminous and Luminous Infrared Galaxies and compare $f_{\text{dense}}$ with a suite of global galaxy properties. We find a significant correlation between $f_{\text{dense}}$ and star formation rate calculated using both infrared luminosities and radio continuum, although there is significant scatter in each relation. We find no trend between global or peak $f_{\text{dense}}$ and merger stage. We find no correlation between global $f_{\text{dense}}$ and X-ray luminosity; however, the correlation becomes significant when we measure $f_{\text{dense}}$ at the location of peak X-ray emission. Our interpretation is that the dense gas is co-localized with strong X-ray emission from an active galactic nuclei or strong central star formation.</description>

      <title>2D Surface Brightness Modelling of Large 2MASS Galaxies II: The Role of Classical Bulges and Pseudobulges on Galaxy Scaling Relations and its implication for Supermassive Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have generated 2D-multicomponent surface brightness (SB) modelling for 100 galaxies in the Large Galaxy Atlas (LGA) together with 19 nearby cD galaxies using the near-infrared (NIR) images from 2MASS (J, H and Ks ). Our final sample of 119 galaxies includes cD galaxies, Virgo cluster galaxies, group galaxies, and field galaxies, but 68 % are spiral galaxies. We revisit known scaling relations (SRs) involving structure parameters, as well as those involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and ultramassive black holes (UMBHs). Refining the SRs, we revisited the classification of bulges. In this study, we have considered the Fundamental Plane (FP) and its projections, as well as other SRs, such as the colour-magnitude relation (CMR), the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and the luminosity-concentration relation (LCR). Classical bulges follow the same relations as elliptical galaxies, while pseudobulges are usually outliers. The NIR colours of classical bulges and pseudobulges indicate that their ages are not radically different despite their spread in luminosity, but we noticed that classical bulges are more luminous than pseudobulges; therefore, this property provides a complementary bulge/pseudobulge classification criterion. We have included pseudobulges from other studies to strengthen our sample's tendencies seen for pseudobulges in our sample. We also revised the SRs for SMBHs and UMBHs, finding that pseudobulges do not follow SRs for early-type galaxies and classical bulges. In addition, the lack of correlation between BHs and discs may indicate these structures have not coevolved. From the revision of SRs, we present a sample of galaxies likely to host SMBHs or UMBHs, which are suitable for dynamical BH mass determination accessible from the ground.</description>

      <title>DIISC -- VI (COS-DIISC): UV Metal Absorption Relative to the H I disk of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the Deciphering the Interplay between the Interstellar medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium (DIISC) survey, we present the UV metal absorption features in the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) near the H I gas disk ($&lt;$4.5$R_\mathrm{HI}$) of 31 nearby galaxies through quasar absorption line spectroscopy. Of the ions under study, Si III $\lambda1206$ was most frequently detected (18 of 31 sight lines), while C II $\lambda1334$ and Si II $\lambda1260$ were detected in 17 and 15 of 31 sight lines, respectively. Many components were consistent with photoionization equilibrium models, most of the cold and cool gas phase clouds were found to have lengths smaller than 2 kpc. Sight lines with smaller impact parameters ($\rho$) normalized by the galaxy's virial radius ($R_\mathrm{vir}$) and H I radius ($R_\mathrm{HI}$) tend to have more components and larger rest-frame equivalent widths ($W_r$) than those that probe the CGM at larger radii. In particular, we find that the location of metals are better traced by $\rho$ / $R_\mathrm{HI}$ rather than the traditional $\rho$ / $R_\mathrm{vir}$. Larger covering fractions are found closer to galaxies, with a radial decline that depends on the $W_r$ limit used. Our results provide new insights into the spatial distribution of metals around the H I disks of low-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>New perspective on the multiple population phenomenon in Galactic globular clusters from a wide-field photometric survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-field photometry of Galactic globular clusters (GCs) has been investigated to overcome limitations from the small field of view of the Hubble Space Telescope in the study of multiple populations. In particular, 'chromosome maps' (ChMs) built with ground-based photometry were constructed to identify the first and second generation stars (1G and 2G) over the wide-field of view. The ChMs allow us to derive the fraction of distinct populations in an analyzed field of view. We present here the radial distribution of the 2G fraction in 29 GCs. The distributions show that all the GCs either have a flat distribution or more centrally concentrated 2G stars. Notably, we find that the fraction of 1G stars outside the half-light radius is clearly bifurcated across all mass range. It implies that a group of GCs with lower 1G fractions (hereafter Group II) have efficiently lost their 1G stars in the outermost cluster regions. In fact, in connection with the trends of the radial distribution, most GCs of Group II have spatially mixed populations, while only less massive GCs in Group I (a group with higher 1G fraction) show that feature. Lastly, we investigate links between these two groups and host cluster parameters. We find that most GCs of Group II are distributed along a broader range of galactocentric distances with smaller perigalactic distances &lt; 3.5 kpc. Besides, by using the Gaia data, it is observed that Group II GCs have higher energy on the integrals of motion diagrams than Group I GCs.</description>

      <title>Tuning the cosmic instrument: robust cosmology through combined probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Behavior of Trapped Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental results on the arrival direction of high-energy cosmic rays have motivated studies to understand their propagating environment. The observed anisotropy is shaped by interstellar and local magnetic fields. In coherent magnetic structures, such as the heliosphere, or due to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, magnetic mirroring can temporarily trap particles, leading to chaotic behavior. In this work, we develop a new method to characterize cosmic rays' chaotic behavior in magnetic systems using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. This quantity determines the degree of chaos and adapts to transitory behavior. We study particle trajectories in an axial-symmetric magnetic bottle to highlight mirroring effects. By introducing time-dependent magnetic perturbations, we study how temporal variations affect chaotic behavior. We tailor our model to the heliosphere; however, it can represent diverse magnetic configurations exhibiting mirroring phenomena. Our results have three key implications. (1)Theoretical: We find a correlation between the finite-time Lyapunov exponent and the particle escape time from the system, which follows a power law that persists even under additional perturbations. This power law may reveal intrinsic system characteristics, offering insight into propagation dynamics beyond simple diffusion. (2)Simulation: Chaotic effects play a role in cosmic ray simulations and can influence the resulting anisotropy maps. (3)Observational: Arrival maps display areas where the chaotic properties vary significantly; these changes can be the basis for time variability in the anisotropy maps. This work lays the framework for studying the effects of magnetic mirroring of cosmic rays within the heliosphere and the role of temporal variability in the observed anisotropy.</description>

      <title>The radio re-brightening of the Type IIb SN 2001ig</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the late-time evolution of the compact Type IIb SN 2001ig in the spiral galaxy NGC 7424, with new and unpublished archival data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. More than two decades after the SN explosion, its radio luminosity is showing a substantial re-brightening: it is now two orders of magnitude brighter than expected from the standard model of a shock expanding into a uniform circumstellar wind (i.e., with a density scaling as R^{-2}). This suggests that the SN ejecta have reached a denser shell, perhaps compressed by the fast wind of the Wolf-Rayet progenitor or expelled centuries before the final stellar collapse. We model the system parameters (circumstellar density profile, shock velocity, mass loss rate), finding that the denser layer was encountered when the shock reached a distance of ~0.1 pc; the mass-loss rate of the progenitor immediately before the explosion was Mdot/v_w ~ 10^{-7} Msun/yr/(km/s). We compare SN 2001ig with other SNe that have shown late-time re-brightenings, and highlight the opposite behaviour of some extended Type IIb SNe which show instead a late-time flux cut-off.</description>

      <title>Signatures of cubic gravity in the strong regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Einsteinian cubic gravity in the strong gravitational regime. In the first part, we explore analytical solutions for a static, spherically symmetric metric, establishing the existence of maximally symmetric de Sitter solutions, as well as asymptotically de Sitter solutions, with an effective cosmological constant. We also study, analytically and numerically, how the horizon properties are affected by cubic gravity. Our results reveal that a positive coupling constant reduces the horizon size, while a negative one increases it. In the second part, we analyze potential observational signatures of cubic terms, focusing on their effects on the bending of light. Specifically, we investigate the angular difference, related to the deflection angle but valid near the source, along with the behavior of the photon sphere. Our findings show that the strongest effects of the cubic terms occur in the strong gravity regime, and there exists a direct relationship between the value of the coupling constant and the photon sphere position, opening up the possibility to constrain cubic gravity with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Super-Earth/Gas Giant Connection in Stellar Mass and Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed correlation between inner super-Earths and outer gas giants places strong constraints on formation theories. Building on previous work, Bryan $\&amp;$ Lee 2024 showed that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between super-Earths and outer gas giants around metal-rich FGK stars, and that this correlation disappears for metal-poor hosts. Here we consider how this connection evolves across stellar mass. Starting with our sample of 85 M-dwarfs ($&lt;$0.6 M$_{\odot}$) hosting inner super-Earths, we calculate P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$&gt;$0) = 9.4 (+10.2 -3.1)$\%$ and P(GG|SE, [Fe/H]$\leq$0)$&lt;$3.1$\%$. Compared to the field gas giant frequency calculated from the Rosenthal et al 2021 sample, we find P(GG|[Fe/H]$&gt;$0) = 10.3 (+6.9 -3.1)$\%$, and P(GG|[Fe/H]$\leq$0)$&lt;$2.6$\%$ for M-dwarfs. While we see a higher gas giant frequency around metal-rich M-dwarfs for both samples, we find no significant correlations between super-Earths and gas giants. Combining our 85 M-dwarf sample with our FGK sample from Bryan $\&amp;$ Lee 2024, we resolve the SE/GG correlation in stellar mass (0.3--1.5 M$_{\odot}$) and metallicity. We show the positive correlation emerges in metal-rich K-dwarfs and strengthens with increasing stellar mass. Gas giant properties also impact the correlation -- for metal rich stars, the positive correlation is strengthened by: 1) dynamically hot gas giants for all stellar masses; 2) distant gas giants only for higher mass stars; and 3) single gas giants for K-dwarfs and multiple gas giants around more massive stars. We discuss how the stellar mass dependence of the inner-outer planet correlation can be understood from the increasing disk mass budget for higher mass stars.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution and clustering properties of the young stellar populations in the Carina Nebula complex and Car OB1</title>

Abstract: We use Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry to analyze the spatial distribution of the young stellar populations and stellar clusters and to search for new OB star candidates in the Carina Nebula complex and the full extent of the Car OB1 association. We first performed a new census of high-mass stars in Car OB1 and compiled a comprehensive catalog of 517 stars with known spectral types that have Gaia DR3 parallaxes consistent with membership in the association. We applied the clustering algorithm DBSCAN on the Gaia data of the region to find stellar clusters, determine their distances and kinematics, and estimate ages. We also used Gaia astrometry and the additional astrophysical_parameters table to perform a spatially unbiased search for further high-mass members of Car OB1 over the full area of the association. Our DBSCAN analysis finds 15 stellar clusters and groups in Car OB1, four of which were not known before. Most clusters (80%) show signs of expansion or contraction, four of them with a &gt;2$\sigma$ significance. We find a global expansion of the Car OB1 association and a kinematic traceback of the high-mass stars shows that the spatial extent of the association was at a minimum 3-4 Myr ago. Using astrophysical parameters by Gaia DR3, we identified 15 new O-type and 589 new B-type star candidates in Car OB1. The majority (&gt;54%) of the high-mass stars constitute a non-clustered distributed stellar population. Based on our sample of high-mass stars, we estimate a total stellar population of at least ~8*10^4 stars in Car OB1. Our study is the first systematic astrometric analysis that covers the full spatial extent of the Car OB1 association, and it therefore substantially increases the knowledge of the distributed stellar population and spatial evolution of the entire association. Our results suggest suggests Car OB1 to be the most massive known star-forming complex in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Effects of Subhalos on Interpreting Highly Magnified Sources Near Lensing Caustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large magnification factors near gravitational lensing caustics of galaxy cluster lenses allow the study of individual stars or compact stellar associations at cosmological distances. We study how the presence of sub-galactic subhalos, an inevitable consequence of cold dark matter, can alter the property of caustics and hence change the interpretation of highly magnified sources that lie atop them. First, we consider a galaxy cluster halo populated with subhalos sampled from a realistic subhalo mass function calibrated to $N$-body simulations. Then, we compare a semi-analytical approximation and an adaptive ray-shooting method which we employ to quantify the property of the caustics. As a case study, we investigate Earendel, a $z = 6.2$ candidate of magnified single or multiple star system with a lone lensed image atop the critical curve in the Sunrise Arc. We find that the source size constraint ($\lesssim 0.3\, \mathrm{pc}$) previously derived from macro lens models should be relaxed by a factor of a few to ten when subhalos are accounted for, therefore allowing the possibility of a compact star cluster. The subhalos could introduce an astrometric perturbation that is $\lesssim 0.5''$, which does not contradict observation. These conclusions are largely robust to changes in the subhalo population. Subhalos therefore should be seriously accounted for when interpreting the astrophysical nature of similar highly magnified sources uncovered in recent high-$z$ observations.</description>

      <title>Probing the rest-frame wavelength dependence of quasar variability : Insights from the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Quasar variability can potentially unlock crucial insights into the accretion process. Understanding how this variability is influenced by wavelength is crucial for validating and refining quasar variability models. Aims: This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the dependence of variability on the rest-frame wavelength ($\lambda_{RF}$) by isolating the variance in different timescales in well-defined wavelength bins and examining the corona-heated accretion-disk (CHAR) model. Methods: We investigated the relation between variance and rest-frame wavelength ($\lambda_{RF}$) using optical g- and r-band light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 15 for $\sim 5000$ quasars within narrow ranges of black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and Eddington ratio ($R_{Edd}$). A spectral model taking into account disk continuum emission, Balmer transitions, Fe II pseudo-continuum emission, and other emission lines is necessary to best interpret the variance spectrum. Results: Our analysis indicates a strong anticorrelation between median variance and $\lambda_{RF}$ for quasars with $M_{BH} = 10^{8}$ and $R_{Edd} = 10^{-1}$ at different timescales. This anti-correlation is more pronounced at shorter timescales. The results align well with a bending power-law power spectrum density (PSD) model with both the damping timescale and the high-frequency slope of the PSD depending on the wavelength. The predictions provided by the CHAR model on the variance spectrum across most timescales studied showcase its potential in constraining temperature variations within the accretion disk.

      <title>The Impact of Classical Bulges on Stellar Bars and Box-Peanut-X-Features in Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic bars and their associated resonances play a significant role in shaping galaxy evolution. Resulting resonance-driven structures, like the vertically extended Boxy/Peanut X-Feature (BPX), then serve as a useful probe of the host galaxy's history. In this study, we quantify the impact of a classical bulge on the evolution of the bar and the growth of bar resonance structures. This is accomplished with a suite of isolated N-body disk galaxy simulations with bulge mass fractions ranging from 0% to 16% of the disk mass. We apply frequency analysis to the stellar orbits to analyze the variations in resonance structure evolution. Our findings indicate that a more massive initial bulge leads to the formation of a stronger and more extended bar and that each bar drives the formation of a prominent associated BPX through resonance passage. In this work, we present evidence that the formation of a BPX is driven by planar, bar-supporting orbits evolving through interaction with horizontal and vertical bar-resonances. More orbits become vertically extended when these resonances intersect, and the rate of the orbits passing through resonance is moderated by the overall fraction of vertically extended orbits. A significant bulge stabilizes the fraction of vertically extended orbits, preventing sudden resonance-induced changes. Crucially, neither sudden resonance intersection nor prolonged resonance trapping is required for BPX formation.</description>

      <title>Direct high-resolution observation of feedback and chemical enrichment in the circumgalactic medium at redshift z ~ 2.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, however, studying the emission from CGM is challenging due to its low surface brightness and the complexities involved in interpreting resonant lines such as Ly$\alpha$. The near-infrared coverage, unprecedented sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of JWST enable us to study the optical strong lines associated with the extended Ly$\alpha$ "nebulae" at redshifts of 2--3. These lines serve as diagnostic tools to infer the physical conditions in the CGM gas reservoir of these systems. In deep medium-band images taken by the JWST, we serendipitously discovered the [O III] emission from the CGM around a massive interacting galaxy system at a redshift z~2.8, known to be embedded in a bright extended (100 kpc) Ly$\alpha$ "nebula." This is the first time that the [O III] lines have been detected from a Ly$\alpha$ "nebula." The JWST images reveal that the CGM gas actually resides in narrow (~ 2.5 kpc) filamentary structures with strong [O III] emission, tracing the same extent as the Ly$\alpha$ emission. An analysis of the [O III] suggests that the emitting CGM is fully ionized and is energetically dominated by mechanical heating. We also find that the density and pressure are higher than those commonly predicted by simulations of the CGM. We conclude that the observed CGM emission originates from the gas expelled by the episodic feedback processes, cooling down and enriching the CGM, while traveling a distance of at least 60 kpc. These observations demonstrate how intensive feedback processes shape gas distribution and properties in the CGM around massive halos. While access to such deep, high-resolution imaging opens up a new discovery space for investigating the CGM, it also challenges numerical simulations with respect to explaining and reproducing the exquisitely complex structures revealed by the observations.</description>

      <title>MUSEQuBES: Connecting HI absorption with Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z \approx 3.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of HI absorption around 96 lya emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx3.3$ (median lya luminosity $\approx10^{42}$ erg.s$^{-1}$). These LAEs were identified within 8 MUSE fields, each $1'\times1'$ on the sky and centered on a bright background quasar, as part of the MUSEQuBES survey. Using Voigt profile fitting for all HI absorbers detected within $\pm500$ km.$s^{-1}$ of these LAEs, we compiled a catalog of 800 HI absorption components. Our analysis shows that HI absorption is enhanced near the LAEs compared to the IGM. However, no trend is found between the column densities of HI absorbers and their impact parameters from the LAEs (spanning $\approx54$ to 260 pkpc). Additionally, all galaxies associated with Lyman-limit systems have impact parameters $&gt;50$ pkpc from the quasar sightlines, suggesting that true absorber-hosts may be too faint to detect. The LAEs show an overall HI covering fraction (fc(HI)) of $\approx88\%$ for a threshold logN(HI)$=15$. Notably, at the same threshold, the pairs/group LAEs exhibit a $100\%$ HI covering fraction out to $\approx 250$ pkpc. In contrast, isolated LAEs consistently show a lower fc(HI) of $\approx80\%$. This environmental influence on fc(HI) is also evident up to $\approx 300$ km.$s^{-1}$ in differential bins of line-of-sight velocity. We find an anti-correlation between fc(HI) and the rest-frame lya-emission equivalent width (ew). Based on the lya-shell model, this could imply that gas-rich galaxies tend to reside in gas-rich environments or that the higher EW LAEs are more efficient at ionizing their surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Simulating High-redshift Galaxies: Enhancing UV Luminosity with Star Formation Efficiency and a Top-heavy IMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent findings from photometric and spectroscopic JWST surveys have identified examples of high-redshift galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$. These high-$z$ galaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than predicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the brightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial masses $M_{\rm vir} = 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 10$. To achieve this, we conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic sub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the observability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star formation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star formation efficiency up to 100\% or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation efficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV luminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting magnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst resulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift galaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions, making the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between star formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies. Also, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an overabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal enrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as effective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as valuable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic results and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence and the invisible Universe: Subradiance as a dark matter mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</description>

      <title>BASS XLVII: 22 GHz Radio Atlas of Swift-BAT Selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected AGN, with a very high $98 \pm 1\%$ detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1" spatial resolution covering over $6$ orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGN that span $\sim4$ orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: $44 \pm 3\%$ (102/231) are compact or unresolved, $46 \pm 3\%$ (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and $8 \pm 2\%$ (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining $2 \pm 1\%$ (4/231) sources are non-detections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGN ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{14-195 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5.5}$ and $\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{2-10 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5}$) with a scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex are similar to that of coronally active stars ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_X \sim 10^{-5}$). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous FIR observations, once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGN at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation VLA (ngVLA) or Square Kilometre Array (SKA), both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGN.</description>

      <title>The Membership and Age of the Planet-hosting Young Star IRAS 04125+2902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transiting planet was recently discovered around a star in the Taurus star-forming region, IRAS 04125+2902, making it one of the youngest known planets. The discovery paper cited two age estimates for IRAS 04125+2902, one based on a comparison to two sets of model isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and a second age reported by an earlier study for a putative population in Taurus that includes IRAS 04125+2902 (D4-North). However, the model isochrones in question differ significantly for most temperatures and luminosities of young low-mass stars, and do not reproduce the observed sequences for the TW Hya and 32 Ori associations (10 and 21 Myr). Meanwhile, as found in my previous work, D4-North is a collection of field stars and fragments of several distinct Taurus groups and older associations, so its quoted age is not meaningful. The true parent population for IRAS 04125+2902 is a small group that is ~35 pc behind the L1495 and B209 clouds (B209N). I have analyzed the age of B209N through a comparison to TW Hya and 32 Ori. The M star sequences in the latter two associations have the same shapes, but the sequence for B209N is flatter, indicating that &gt;M4 stars at ages of &lt;10 Myr fade more quickly than stars at earlier types and older ages. For the one member of B209N that is earlier than M4 (IRAS 04125+2902), I estimate an age of 3.0+/-0.4 Myr based on its offsets from TW Hya and 32 Ori, which by happenstance is similar to the value derived through the comparison to model isochrones.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Colour standardisation of Type Ia Supernovae and its dependence on environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology transitions from a statistics-dominated to a systematics-dominated era, it is crucial to understand the remaining unexplained uncertainties that affect their luminosity, such as those stemming from astrophysical biases. SNe Ia are standardisable candles whose absolute magnitude reaches a scatter of 0.15 mag when empirical correlations with their light-curve stretch and colour and with their environment are accounted for. We investigate the dependence of the standardisation process of SNe Ia on the astrophysical environment, focusing on colour standardisation. We used the volume-limited ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample, which offers unprecedented statistics for the low-redshift ($z &lt; 0.06$) range. We first studied the colour distribution, to then select a dustless subsample of objects. We then examined the colour-residual relation and its associated parameter $\beta$. Finally, we investigated the colour dependence of the environment-dependent magnitude offsets (steps) to separate their intrinsic and extrinsic components. Our sample of nearly 1,000 SNe probes the red tail of the colour distribution up to $c = 0.8$. The dustless sample exhibits a significantly shorter red tail ($4.3\sigma$) than the whole sample, but the distributions around $c\sim0$ are similar for both samples. This suggests that the reddening above $c\geq0.2$ is dominated by interstellar dust absorption of the host. The colour-residual relation is linear with SN colour. We found indications of a potential evolution of $\beta$ with the stellar host mass, with $\beta\sim3.6$ for low-mass galaxies, compared to $\beta=3.05\pm0.06$ for the full sample. Finally, in contrast to recent claims from the literature, we found no evolution of steps as a function of SN colour. This suggests that dust may not be the dominating mechanism for the dependence on the environment of the magnitude of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Vortex Lines in Ultralight Bosonic Dark Matter around Rotating Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical analysis of the interaction between superfluid dark matter and rotating supermassive black holes offers a promising framework for probing quantum effects in ultralight dark matter and its role in galactic structure. We study how black hole rotation influences the state of ultralight bosonic dark matter, focusing on the stability and dynamics of vortex lines. The gravitational effects of both dark matter and the black hole on the physical properties of these vortex lines, including their precession around the black hole, are analyzed.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Dust Declines in R Coronae Borealis Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables are rare, hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiants known for large, erratic declines in brightness due to dust formation. Recently, the number of known RCB stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds has increased from $\sim$30 to 162. We use all-sky and targeted photometric surveys to create the longest possible light curves for all known RCB stars and systematically study their declines. Our study, the largest of its kind, includes measurements of decline activity levels, morphologies, and periodicities for nearly all RCB stars. We confirm previous predictions that cool RCB stars exhibit more declines than warm RCBs, supporting a relationship between dust formation and condensation temperatures. We also find evidence for two distinct dust production mechanisms. R CrB and SU Tau show decline onsets consistent with a Poisson process, suggesting their dust production is driven by stochastic processes, such as convection. In contrast, RY Sgr's declines correlate with its pulsation period, suggesting that its dust production is driven by pulsationally-induced shocks. Finally, we show that the dust properties of the related class of DY~Per variables differ from those of the RCB stars, suggesting differences in their evolutionary status.</description>

      <title>Learning to See: Applying Inverse Recurrent Inference Machines to See through Refractive Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced horizon-resolving images of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A$^*$). Scattering in the turbulent plasma of the interstellar medium distorts the appearance of Sgr A$^*$ on scales only marginally smaller than the fiducial resolution of EHT. Therefore, this process both diffractive blurs and adds stochastic refractive substructures that limits the practical angular resolution of EHT images of Sgr A$^*$. We utilized a novel recurrent neural network machine learning framework to demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate interstellar scattering at wavelengths of $1.3\,{\rm mm}$ near the galactic center up to structures at the scale of $5\mu{as}$ well below the nominal instrumental resolution of EHT, $24\,\mu{\rm as}$.</description>
