      <title>Exploring Exponential Parametrization of Neutrino Mass Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the exponential parameterization of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix texture. In this regard, the elements of the mass matrix are expressed in terms of their absolute values and arguments. We propose a neutrino mass matrix texture that highlights four correlations among its elements. The mixing scheme obtained from the proposed texture is consistent with experimental observations. In addition, we derive the proposed texture from the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \times A_4 \times Z_{10}$ group in the light of the seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Searching for a dark matter induced galactic axion gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultra-light axion with CP violating interactions with a dark sector and CP preserving interactions with the visible sector can act as a novel portal between dark matter and the Standard Model. In such theories, dark matter sources an axion field extending over the entire galaxy, the gradient of which can be searched for with precise spin precession experiments. A reinterpretation of existing co-magnetometer data already constrains theories that are consistent with astrophysical bounds, and near-future experiments will begin probing well-motivated models. The required interactions can arise from a confining hidden sector without necessitating fine-tuning of the axion's mass.</description>

      <title>A Modern Look at the Oscillation Physics Case for a Neutrino Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments, JUNO, DUNE, and HK, are under construction now and will collect data over the next decade and beyond. As there are no approved plans to follow up this program with more advanced neutrino oscillation experiments, we consider here one option that had gained considerable interest more than a decade ago: a neutrino factory. Such an experiment uses stored muons in a racetrack configuration with extremely well characterized decays reducing systematic uncertainties and providing for more oscillation channels. Such a machine could also be one step towards a high energy muon collider program. We consider a long-baseline configuration to SURF using the DUNE far detectors or modifications thereof, and compare the expected sensitivities to the three-flavor oscillation parameters to the anticipated results from DUNE and HK. We find that a neutrino factory can improve our understanding of CP violation and also aid in disentangling the complicated flavor puzzle.</description>

      <title>A Precise Fitting Formula for Gravitational Wave Spectra from Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining a precise form for the predicted gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from a phase transition is a topic of great relevance for beyond Standard Model (BSM) physicists. Currently, the most sophisticated semi-analytic framework for estimating the dominant contribution to the spectrum is the sound shell model; however, full calculations within this framework can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale scans. The community therefore generally manages with fit functions to the GW spectrum, the most widely used of which is a single broken power law. We provide a more precise fit function based on the sound shell model: our fit function features a double broken power law with two frequency breaks corresponding to the two characteristic length scales of the problem -- inter-bubble spacing and thickness of sound shells, the second of which is neglected in the single broken power law fit. Compared to previously proposed fits, we demonstrate that our fit function more faithfully captures the GW spectrum coming from a full calculation of the sound shell model, over most of the space of the thermodynamic parameters governing the phase transition. The physical origins of the fit parameters and their dependence on the thermodynamic parameters are studied in the underlying sound shell model: in particular, we perform a series of detailed scans for these quantities over the plane of the strength of the phase transition ($\alpha$) and the bubble wall velocity ($v_w$). Wherever possible, we comment on the physical interpretations of these scans. The result of our study can be used to generate accurate GW spectra with our fit function, given initial inputs of $\alpha$, $v_w$, $\beta/H$ (nucleation rate parameter) and $T_n$ (nucleation temperature) for the relevant BSM scenario.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis in Realistic Flipped SU(5)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study thermal leptogenesis in realistic supersymmetric flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)$ unification. As up-type quarks and neutrinos are arranged in the same multiplets, they exhibit strong correlations, and it is commonly believed that the masses of right-handed (RH) neutrinos are too hierarchical to fit the low-energy neutrino data. This pattern generally predicts a lightest RH neutrino too light to yield successful leptogenesis, with any lepton-antilepton asymmetry generated from heavier neutrinos being washed out unless special flavour structures are assumed. We propose a different scenario in which the lightest two RH neutrinos $N_1$ and $N_2$ have nearby masses of order $10^9$ GeV, with thermal leptogenesis arising non-resonantly from both $N_1$ and $N_2$. We show that this pattern is consistent with all data on fermion masses and mixing and predicts the lightest physical left-handed neutrino mass to be smaller than about $10^{-7}$ eV. The Dirac phase, which does not take the maximal CP-violating value, plays an important role in leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Lorentz invariance violation and ultralight axion-like dark matter searches at the European Spallation Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter conundrum stands out as one of the central challenges to understand in both particle physics and cosmology. The ultralight axion-like particle (UALP) is an appealing dark matter candidate that can be searched for in neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we examined the interaction among neutrinos and a UALP; such interaction might induce violations of the Lorentz and $CPT$ symmetries. We assessed the sensitivity to both the isotropic $CPT-$odd Standard Model Extension (SME) coefficients $(a_{L})^T$ and effective neutrino-UALP couplings $\tilde{g}$ at the next-to-next generation neutrino oscillation experiment at the European Spallation Source (ESS).</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Unexplored Decay Mode of a Light Charged Higgs Boson to an Off-Shell Top Quark and a Bottom Quark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged Higgs boson ($H^\pm$) with a mass below the top quark mass remains a viable possibility within the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model under current constraints. While previous LHC searches have primarily focused on the $H^\pm\to\tau\nu$ decay mode, the decay channel into an off-shell top quark and a bottom quark, $H^\pm \rightarrow t^*b$, is leading or subleading for $H^\pm$ masses between 130 and 170 GeV. This study investigates the discovery potential of future colliders for this off-shell decay mode through pair-produced charged Higgs bosons decaying via $H^+H^-\rightarrow t^*b\tau\nu\rightarrow bbjj\tau\nu$. We perform signal-to-background analyses at the HL-LHC and a prospective 100 TeV proton-proton collider, employing cut-flow strategies and the Boosted Decision Tree method. However, due to the softness of the $b$ jets, signal significances fall below detection thresholds at these facilities. Extending our study to a multi-TeV muon collider (MuC), we demonstrate that a 3 TeV MuC achieves high signal significance, surpassing the $5\sigma$ threshold with an integrated luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$, assuming a 10\% background uncertainty. Specifically, for $M_{H^\pm} = 130$, 150, and 170 GeV, the significances are 13.7, 13.5, and 6.06, respectively. In contrast, a 10 TeV MuC requires 10 ab$^{-1}$ to achieve similar results. Our findings highlight the critical role of the MuC in probing the new signal channel $H^\pm\rightarrow t^*b$, offering a promising avenue for future charged Higgs boson searches involving off-shell top quarks.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the color dipole cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Laplace transform techniques, we describe the evolution of the color dipole cross section, at the leading-order and next-to-leading order approximations, from the Bartels-Golec-Biernat-Kowalski model in a kinematical region of low values of the Bjorken variable $x$ and a wide range of transverse dipole size $r$. This evolution method shows that the saturation scale and geometric scaling are retained. We derived analytical results for the integrated and unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution functions and compared them with the CJ15 parametrization group and the unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution models respectively. The Sudakov form factor into the evolution of the unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution is incorporated and the results are considered at small and large values of $k_{t}^{2}$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism, a prominent framework for explaining the observed flavor hierarchies, generically predicts the existence of an axion-like particle (ALP). This work examines a class of FN models based on $\mathbb{Z}_N$ discrete symmetries. We chart the allowed parameter space from a set of theoretical considerations and construct explicit renormalizable completions with minimal field content necessary to generate consistent textures. We then conduct comprehensive phenomenological analyses of two particularly elegant $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_8$ models, highlighting the interplay between the effects of the ALP and the associated UV fields. We find that the FN scale can be as low as a few TeV.</description>

      <title>Backward DVCS on the pion in Sullivan processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to do a systematic feasibility study of measuring in backward region deeply virtual Compton scattering on the pion in Sullivan processes in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave functions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and deriving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon. This work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that could be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It will also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives access to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here report on the progress of the HHH Workshop, that took place in Dubrovnik in July 2023. After the discovery of a particle that complies with the properties of the Higgs boson of the Standard Model, all SM parameters are in principle determined. However, in order to verify or falsify the model, the full form of the potential has to be determined. This includes the measurement of the triple and quartic scalar couplings. We here report on ongoing progress of measurements for multi scalar final states, with an emphasis on three SM-like scalar bosons at 125 GeV, but also mentioning other options. We discuss both experimental progress and challenges as well as theoretical studies and models that can enhance such rates with respect to the SM predictions.</description>

      <title>Effects of Multi-Parton Interactions in Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first systematic study of the effects of multi-parton interactions (MPI's) in the context of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions with the jet quenching model JEWEL. We use the simple MPI model of PYTHIA 6, on which JEWEL is based. We find negligible effects on all observables except jet-hadron and Z-hadron correlations, which show a moderate enhancement at large distances. More detailed analysis at parton level reveals that, in heavy-ion collisions, the MPI contribution to jets is suppressed by quenching effects.</description>

      <title>$\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ elastic scattering in Borexino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of neutrino-electron elastic scattering using the mono-energetic $^{7}$Be neutrinos in Borexino, with an emphasis on exploring the differences between the contributions of $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, and $\nu_\tau$. We find that current data are capable of measuring these components such that the contributions from $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ cannot be zero, although distinguishing between them is challenging -- the differences stemming from Standard Model radiative corrections are insufficient without significantly more precise measurements. In studying these components, we compare predicted neutrino-electron scattering event rates within the Standard Model (accounting for neutrino oscillations), as well as going beyond the Standard Model in two ways. We allow for non-unitary evolution to modify neutrino oscillations, and find that with a larger exposure (${\sim}30$x), Borexino may provide relevant information for constraining non-unitarity, and that JUNO may be able to accomplish this with its data collection of $^{7}$Be neutrinos. We also consider novel $\nu_\mu$- and $\nu_\tau$-electron scattering from a gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ model, showing consistency with previous analyses of Borexino and this scenario, but also demonstrating the impact of uncertainties on Standard Model mixing parameters on these results.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves from Scattering, Bremsstrahlung and Decay during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-high frequency gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. Specifically, we study inflaton scattering with its decay product, where the couplings involved in this $2 \to 2$ scattering are the same as those in the $1 \to 3$ graviton Bremsstrahlung process. We compute the graviton production rate via such $2 \to 2$ scattering. Additionally, we compare the resulting GW spectrum with that from Bremsstrahlung as well as that from pure $2 \to 2$ inflaton scatterings. For completeness, the GW spectrum from graviton pair production through one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is also analyzed. With a systematic comparison among the four sources of GWs, we find that $2 \to 2$ inflaton scattering with its decay product can dominate over Bremsstrahlung if the reheating temperature is larger than the inflaton mass. Pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering is typically subdominant compared to Bremsstrahlung except in the high-frequency tail. The contribution from one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is shown to be suppressed compared to Bremsstrahlung and pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Polyadic sigma matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize $\sigma$-matrices to higher arities using the polyadization procedure proposed by the author. We build the nonderived $n$-ary version of $SU\left( 2\right) $ using cyclic shift block matrices. We define a new function, the polyadic trace, which has an additivity property analogous to the ordinary trace for block diagonal matrices and which can be used to build the corresponding invariants. The elementary $\Sigma$-matrices introduced here play a role similar to ordinary matrix units, and their sums are full $\Sigma$-matrices which can be treated as a polyadic analog of $\sigma$-matrices. The presentation of $n$-ary $SU\left( 2\right) $ in terms of full $\Sigma$-matrices is done using the Hadamard product. We then generalize the Pauli group in two ways: for the binary case we introduce the extended phase shifted $\sigma$-matrices with multipliers in cyclic groups of order $4q$ ($q&gt;4$), and for the polyadic case we construct the correspondent finite $n$-ary semigroup of phase-shifted elementary $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q\left( n-1\right) +1$, and the finite $n$-ary group of phase-shifted full $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q$. Finally, we introduce the finite $n$-ary group of heterogeneous full $\mathit{\Sigma}^{het}$-matrices of order $\left( 4q\left( n-1\right) \right) ^{4}$. Some examples of the lowest arities are presented.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of DESI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration has recently released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from the first year of observations. A joint analysis of DESI BAO, CMB, and SN Ia probes indicates a preference for time-evolving dark energy. We evaluate the robustness of this preference by replacing the DESI distance measurements at $z&lt;0.8$ with the SDSS BAO measurements in a similar redshift range. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we find an evolution of the dark energy equation of state parameters consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis of $\chi^2$ statistics across various BAO datasets shows that DESI's preference for evolving dark energy is primarily driven by the two LRG samples at $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ and $z_{\rm eff}=0.71$, with the latter having the most significant impact.
  Taking this preference seriously, we study a general Horndeski scalar-tensor theory, which provides a physical mechanism to safely cross the phantom divide, $w=-1$. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we derive constraints on the parameters $w_0=-0.856\pm0.062$ and $w_a=-0.53_{-0.26}^{+0.28}$ at $68\%$ CL from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI BAO, and Pantheon+ datasets, showing good consistency with the standard $w_0w_a$CDM model. The modified gravity model shows a preference over $\Lambda$CDM at the $2.4\sigma$ level, while for $w_0w_a$CDM it is at $2.5\sigma$. We conclude that modified gravity offers a viable physical explanation for DESI's preference for evolving dark energy.</description>

Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves have crucial implications for the origin of the universe and fundamental physics. Using currently available cosmic microwave background data from Planck, WMAP, ACT and SPT separately or their combinations with BK18 B-mode polarization and DESI observations, we find the evidence of primordial gravitational waves at beyond the $5\,\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Evolution of High-energy Electron Distribution in Pulsar Wind Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 17 powerful (with a spin-down luminosity greater than $10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$) young (with an age less than 15000 yrs) pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) using a simple time-independent one-zone emission model. Our aim is to investigate correlations between model parameters and the ages of the corresponding PWNe, thereby revealing the evolution of high-energy electron distributions within PWNe. Our findings are as follows: (1) The electron distributions in PWNe can be characterized by a double power-law with a superexponential cutoff; (2) As PWNe evolve, the high-energy end of the electron distribution spectrum becomes harder with the index decreasing from approximately 3.5 to 2.5, while the low-energy end spectrum index remains constant near 1.5; (3) There is no apparent correlation between the break energy or cutoff energy and the age of PWNe. (4) The average magnetic field within PWNe decreases with age, leading to a positive correlation between the energy loss timescale of electrons at the break energy or the high-energy cutoff, and the age of the PWN. (5) The total electron energy within PWNe remains constant near $2 \times 10^{48}$ erg, while the total magnetic energy decreases with age.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the large scale nuclear shell model to calculate the nuclear matrix elements for the neutrino mediated neutrinoless double beta decay within the Left-Right symmetric model for four nuclei: $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{130}$Te and $^{136}$Xe. We perform a systematic analysis on the general magnitude of different terms for related mechanisms. For the $\eta$ mechanism, we find that the weak magnetism $R$ term dominates the decay rate while the $p$-wave effect is suppressed. While for the $\lambda$ mechanism, the $\omega$ and the $q$ terms are with equal importance. For the latter $q$ term, important contributions from weak-magnetism MM part are observed. Finally, we give the constraints on the new physics parameters $m_{\beta\beta}$, $\lambda$ and $\eta$ from current experiments.</description>

      <title>High-speed reconstruction of long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals using sparse dictionary learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring accurate long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could provide scientifically fruitful knowledge of massive black hole populations and robust tests for general relatively during the LISA mission. However, the immense computational requirements surrounding EMRI data processing and analysis makes their detection and analysis challenging. We further develop and explore a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm to expeditiously reconstruct EMRI gravitational waveforms lasting as long as 1 year. A suite of year-long EMRI systems are studied to understand the detection and accurate waveform retrieval prospects of the method. We show that full-year EMRIs can be reconstructed within 2 minutes, some with a false alarm rate less than 0.001/yr and with 1.16 day time windows with mismatch as low as 0.06. This provides an encouraging prospect to use the SDL method for long-duration GW searches like that for EMRIs in this study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five dimensional super conformal field theories can be studied using their geometric realisation as a limit of $M$-theory on a metrically conical Calabi-Yau threefold. We utilise this framework to investigate the phases of such theories that arise by varying the couplings away from the conformal point. We demonstrate that many 5d SCFTs, including strongly coupled gauge theories, have couplings giving rise to massive, confining vacua with confining strings and corresponding unbroken 1-form symmetries. The simplest examples arise by considering the parameter space of {\it complete} Ricci flat metrics on discrete quotients of the standard conifold singularity. Varying other couplings produces coupled 5d SCFTs interacting via massive BPS instanton particle states.</description>

Abstract: We derive the relativistic quantum kinetic equation for massless fermions with vector and axial vector interaction using the Wigner function formalism. The vector and axial vector currents are self-consistently treated with corresponding constraint equations. The kinetic equations are derived and the condition for equilibrium is discussed up to the first order of $\hbar$. In addition to the vorticity and shear contributions, the divergence of the local particle number density is also found to contribute to the kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>First characterization of the scattering length distribution of vector meson interaction with deuteron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the framework of the vector meson dominance model (VMD), the absolute scattering lengths of light vector mesons ($\phi$, $\omega$, and $\rho$) with the deuteron are calculated from the cross sections of vector meson photoproduction off a deuteron. Additionally, a fitting function is used to predict the scattering lengths of the heavy vector mesons $J/\psi$-$d$ and $% \Upsilon$-$d$. Based on these results, the distribution of the scattering lengths $|\alpha_{V d}|$ between vector mesons and the deuteron is presented for the first time and compared with the scattering lengths $|\alpha_{V p}|$ between vector mesons and the proton. It is found that as the mass of the vector meson increases, the scattering lengths $|\alpha_{V d}|$ become closer to $|\alpha_{V p}|$. In addition, the correlation analysis indicates a strong positive relationship between the scattering length and the vector meson radius, with a high correlation coefficient. The implications of results are essential for improving our understanding of the interaction between hadron and nucleus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of far-detector programs have been proposed for operation at various interaction points of the Large Hadron Collider during the upcoming runs. Investigating the potential and complementarity of these experiments for new-physics searches goes through the estimation of their sensitivity to specific long-lived particle models. Here, we present an integrated numerical tool written in the C++ language and called Displaced Decay Counter, which we have created to this end and which can be used in association with MadGraph5, Pythia8, or any other state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo collider simulation tool. Several far-detector models have been implemented within the program, accounting for the geometry and integrated luminosity of projected detectors. Additional or more accurate designs can be easily constructed through a dedicated interface. The functionality of this tool is exemplified through the discussion of three benchmark scenarios, which we consider for the validation of the implemented detector models.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the potential of probing the inelastic dark matter (DM) model with an extra U(1)D gauge symmetry at the Large Hadron Collider, ForwArd Search ExpeRiment and Super Tau Charm Factory. To saturate the observed DM relic density, the mass splitting between two light dark states has to be small enough, and thus leads to some distinctive signatures at these colliders. By searching for the long-lived particle, the displaced muon-jets, the soft leptons, and the mono-photon events, we find that the inelastic DM mass in the range of 1 MeV to 210 GeV could be tested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility that dark matter re-enters kinetic equilibrium with a radiation bath after kinetic decoupling, a scenario we dub kinetic recoupling. This naturally occurs, for instance, with certain types of resonantly-enhanced interactions, or as the result of a phase transition. While late kinetic decoupling damps structure on small scales below a cutoff, kinetic recoupling produces more complex changes in the power spectrum that depend on the nature and extent of the recoupling period. We explore the features that kinetic recoupling imprints upon the matter power spectrum, and discuss how such features can be traced to dark matter microphysics with future observations.</description>

      <title>Allowed region for the (second) lightest mass $M_{1,2}$ of right-handed neutrino $\nu_{R 1,2}$ with $SO (10)$-inspired relations and sequential dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the (second) lightest mass $M_{1,2}$ of right-handed neutrino $\nu_{R1,2}$ in grand unified theories with the type-I seesaw mechanism that predicts an almost massless neutrino $m_{1 \, \rm or \, 3} \sim 0$. By chiral perturbative treatment, the masses $M_{1,2}$ are expressed as $M_{1} = m_{D1}^{2}/m_{11} , \, M_{2} = m_{D2}^{2} m_{11} / (m_{11} m_{22} - m_{12}^{2})$ with the mass matrix of left-handed neutrinos $m$ in the diagonal basis of the Dirac mass matrix $m_{D}$.
  Assuming $m_{Di}$ and the unitary matrix $V$ in the singular value decomposition $(m_{D})_{ij} = V_{ik} m_{D k} U^{\dagger}_{kj}$ are close to observed fermion masses and the CKM matrix, $M_{1,2}$ and their allowed regions are expressed by parameters in the low energy and unknown phases. As a result, for $m_{D1} \simeq 0.5$ MeV and $m_{D2} \simeq 100$ MeV, we obtain $M_{1}^{\rm NH} \simeq 3 \times 10^{4 - 6}$ GeV and $M_{2}^{\rm NH} \simeq 3 \times 10^{6-8}$ GeV in the NH, $M_{1}^{\rm IH} \simeq 5 \times 10^{3 - 4}$ GeV and $M_{2}^{\rm IH} \simeq 4 \times 10^{8-9}$ GeV in the IH. These upper and lower bounds are proportional to $m_{Di}^{2}$ or $m_{D1} m_{D2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach for measuring the moments of the hadronic invariant mass distribution in semileptonic $B_{s}^{0}$ meson decays using a sum-of-exclusive technique. Using the present and foreseen knowledge about exclusive semileptonic $B_{s}^{0}$ decays, we estimate the uncertainties on moments of the kinematic distribution. Semileptonic $B_{s}^{0}$ decays can be described, as their $B^{0}$ counterpart, using the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE), with the only difference between the $B_{s}^{0}$ and $B^{0}$ mesons being the $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects that change the numerical values of the non-perturbative HQE parameters. We extract the HQE parameters for the $B_{s}^{0}$ decays from our estimates of the moments, showing the potential of the proposed method. We identify a set of required measurements for a future precision measurement.</description>

Abstract: We present shower formation constraints on the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) energy scale for photons with cubic dispersion relation from recent gamma ray observations in $100$ TeV -- PeV energy range by LHAASO observatory. We assume Myers-Pospelov effective field theory framework, and calculate the suppression for the Bethe-Heitler process which is mainly responsible for the formation of photon-initiated atmosphere showers. Comparing the high-energy photon events with the suppressed flux predictions we obtain $95\%$ CL constraints on the LIV energy scale. The obtained shower constraint $E_{\rm LIV} \gtrsim \mathcal{O} \left( 10^{20} \mbox{ GeV}\right)$ is significantly weaker than existing birefringence constraints but is independent.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the bubble wall velocity for a large jump in degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bubble expansion velocity is an important parameter in the prediction of gravitational waves from first order phase transitions. This parameter is difficult to compute, especially in phase transitions in strongly coupled theories. In this work, we present a method to estimate the wall velocity for phase transitions with a large enthalpy jump, valid for weakly and strongly coupled theories. We find that detonations are disfavored in this limit, but wall velocities are not necessarily small. We also investigate the effect of two other features in the equation of state: non-conformal sound speeds and a limited range of temperatures for which the phases exist. We find that the former can increase the wall velocity for a given nucleation temperature, and the latter can restrict the wall velocities to small values. To test our approach, we use holographic phase transitions, which typically display these three features. We find excellent agreement with numerically obtained values of the wall velocity. We also demonstrate that the implications for gravitational waves can be significant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon number is an accidental symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian that so far has been measured to be exactly preserved, although it is expected to be violated at higher energies. In this work we compute order-of-magnitude estimates for the matching contributions of generic ultraviolet models to effective operators that generate nucleon decay processes. This is done in a systematic and automated way using operators constructed from SM fields up to dimension nine and working in a framework that has proved useful in the study of lepton-number violation. For each of the operators we derive estimates for the rates of different nucleon-decay channels. These allow us to establish model-independent lower bounds on the underlying new-physics scale and identify potential correlations between the various decay modes. The results are most relevant for genuine models that do not generate nucleon decay at a lower order. This analysis is especially timely given the expected future sensitivities in numerous experiments such as Hyper-K, DUNE, JUNO and THEIA.</description>

      <title>Probing the inverse moment of $B_s$-meson distribution amplitude via $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16737v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse moment of the $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), denoted as $\lambda_{B_s}$ and defined within the heavy quark effective theory, through the calculation of $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors. The presence of the $s$-quark inside the $B_s$-meson dictates a notable departure of approximately $20\%$ in the $\lambda_{B_s}$ value compared to the non-strange case $\lambda_{B_q}$, as computed within the QCD sum rule approach, albeit with significant uncertainty. First, we compute the decay constant of the $\eta_s$-meson utilizing two-point sum rules while retaining finite $s$-quark mass contributions. Next, we constrain the parameter $\lambda_{B_s}$ by calculating $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors within the light-cone sum rule approach, using $B_s$-meson LCDAs, and leveraging Lattice QCD estimates at zero momentum transfer from the HPQCD collaboration. Our findings yield $\lambda_{B_s}$ = 480 $\pm$ 92 MeV when expressing the $B_s$-meson LCDAs in the Exponential model, consistent with previous QCD sum rule estimate yet exhibiting a 1.5-fold improvement in uncertainty. Furthermore, we compare the form factor predictions, based on the extracted $\lambda_{B_s}$ value, with earlier analyses for other channels such as $B_s \to D_s$ and $B_s \to K$.</description>

      <title>On the addition of a large scalar multiplet to the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the addition of a single $SU(2)$ multiplet of complex scalar fields to the Standard Model (SM). We explicitly consider the various possible values of the weak isospin $J$ of that multiplet, up to and including $J = 7/2$. We allow the multiplet to have arbitrary weak hypercharge. The scalar fields of the multiplet are assumed to have no vacuum expectation value; the mass differences among the components of the multiplet originate in its coupling, present in the scalar potential (SP), to the Higgs doublet of the SM. We derive exact bounded-from-below and unitarity conditions on the SP, thereby constraining those mass differences. We compare those constraints to the ones that may be derived from the oblique parameters.</description>

      <title>Indirect Detection for Higgs Portal Majorana Fermionic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\gamma$-ray signal emitted from dark matter (DM) pair annihilation in the Higgs portal Majorana fermion DM model. In the model, a Majorana fermion DM $\chi$ couples with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field $H$ through a higher-dimensional term $-{\cal L}\supset H^\dagger H \bar{\chi}\chi/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is a cutoff scale. The pair annihilation of $\chi$ through the above term produces the Higgs boson and the longitudinal modes of $W,Z$ gauge bosons. The Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) are used as the most promising targets to search for the $\gamma$-ray signal of the model, due to high DM density and lack of astrophysical backgrounds. The {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope ({\it Fermi}-LAT) is used for the search, for its high sensitivity. In this work, we use 14-year {\it Fermi}-LAT data from 16 dSphs, to constrain the DM pair annihilation cross section for the DM mass range from 125 GeV to 100 TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of [1], where good agreement was obtained between calculations within the framework of analytic QCD and experimental data on polarized Bjorken sum rule. The photoproduction limit was also considered and a new representation of the perturbative contribution to the polarized Bjorken sum rule was obtained.</description>

      <title>Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an Expanding $\Lambda$CDM Universe: Resolving the Local Group mass tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of dark energy. This work compares the evolution of the LG by considering it as a two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full $\Lambda$CDM background. Using the Timing Argument (which links LG dynamics to LG mass) we find that the full $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ lower mass for the LG while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher mass. By the calibration of the IllustrisTNG simulations, the TA mass is shown to be biased high, and modified to be $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the MW Center Of Mass (COM) reduce the LG mass to be $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The overall estimated mass is compatible with the total sum of masses of MW and M31 (including their halos) estimated independently. The mass also is compatible with other estimations such as the Hubble flow, the Virial Theorem with the other dwarf galaxies and different Machine Learning methods based on LG-like pairs from simulations. These results resolve the controversy between the TA based estimations and the other probes in the literature.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Fundamental Interactions via Isotopic Shifts in Molecular Lattice Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements with ultracold atoms and molecules are primed to probe beyond-the-Standard Model physics. Isotopologues of homonuclear molecules are a natural testbed for new Yukawa-type mass-dependent forces at nanometer scales, complementing existing mesoscopic-body and neutron scattering experiments. Here we propose using isotopic shift measurements in molecular lattice clocks to constrain these new interactions from new massive scalar particles in keV$/c^2$ range: the new interaction would impart an extra isotopic shift to molecular levels on top of one predicted by the Standard Model. For the strontium dimer, a Hz-level agreement between experiment and theory could constrain the coupling of the new particles to hadrons by up to an order-of-magnitude over the most stringent existing experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy Ion Collisions: The Present and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>
