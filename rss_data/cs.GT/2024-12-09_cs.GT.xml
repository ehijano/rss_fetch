      <title>Game-Theoretic Foundations for Cyber Resilience Against Deceptive Information Attacks in Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity and interconnectivity of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) make them increasingly vulnerable to advanced cyber threats, particularly deceptive information attacks. These sophisticated threats exploit vulnerabilities to manipulate data integrity and decision-making processes through techniques such as data poisoning, spoofing, and phishing. They target multiple ITS domains, including intra-vehicle systems, inter-vehicle communications, transportation infrastructure, and human interactions, creating cascading effects across the ecosystem. This chapter introduces a game-theoretic framework, enhanced by control and learning theories, to systematically analyze and mitigate these risks. By modeling the strategic interactions among attackers, users, and system operators, the framework facilitates comprehensive risk assessment and the design of adaptive, scalable resilience mechanisms. A prime example of this approach is the Proactive Risk Assessment and Mitigation of Misinformed Demand Attacks (PRADA) system, which integrates trust mechanisms, dynamic learning processes, and multi-layered defense strategies to counteract deceptive attacks on navigational recommendation systems. In addition, the chapter explores the broader applicability of these methodologies to address various ITS threats, including spoofing, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), and denial-of-service attacks. It highlights cross-domain resilience strategies, offering actionable insights to bolster the security, reliability, and adaptability of ITS. By providing a robust game-theoretic foundation, this work advances the development of comprehensive solutions to the evolving challenges in ITS cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>AI's assigned gender affects human-AI cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation between humans and machines is increasingly vital as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into daily life. Research indicates that people are often less willing to cooperate with AI agents than with humans, more readily exploiting AI for personal gain. While prior studies have shown that giving AI agents human-like features influences people's cooperation with them, the impact of AI's assigned gender remains underexplored. This study investigates how human cooperation varies based on gender labels assigned to AI agents with which they interact. In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, 402 participants interacted with partners labelled as AI (bot) or humans. The partners were also labelled male, female, non-binary, or gender-neutral. Results revealed that participants tended to exploit female-labelled and distrust male-labelled AI agents more than their human counterparts, reflecting gender biases similar to those in human-human interactions. These findings highlight the significance of gender biases in human-AI interactions that must be considered in future policy, design of interactive AI systems, and regulation of their use.</description>
