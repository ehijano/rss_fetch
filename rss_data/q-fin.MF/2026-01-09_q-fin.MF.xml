      <title>Forecasting the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve: A Distributionally Robust Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study U.S. Treasury yield curve forecasting under distributional uncertainty and recast forecasting as an operations research and managerial decision problem. Rather than minimizing average forecast error, the forecaster selects a decision rule that minimizes worst case expected loss over an ambiguity set of forecast error distributions. To this end, we propose a distributionally robust ensemble forecasting framework that integrates parametric factor models with high dimensional nonparametric machine learning models through adaptive forecast combinations. The framework consists of three machine learning components. First, a rolling window Factor Augmented Dynamic Nelson Siegel model captures level, slope, and curvature dynamics using principal components extracted from economic indicators. Second, Random Forest models capture nonlinear interactions among macro financial drivers and lagged Treasury yields. Third, distributionally robust forecast combination schemes aggregate heterogeneous forecasts under moment uncertainty, penalizing downside tail risk via expected shortfall and stabilizing second moment estimation through ridge regularized covariance matrices. The severity of the worst case criterion is adjustable, allowing the forecaster to regulate the trade off between robustness and statistical efficiency. Using monthly data, we evaluate out of sample forecasts across maturities and horizons from one to twelve months ahead. Adaptive combinations deliver superior performance at short horizons, while Random Forest forecasts dominate at longer horizons. Extensions to global sovereign bond yields confirm the stability and generalizability of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of invariant measures as a structural property of markov kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify indecomposability as a key measure-theoretic underlying uniqueness of invariant probability measures for discrete-time Markov kernels on general state spaces. The argument relies on the mutual singularity of distinct invariant ergodic measures and on the observation that uniqueness follows whenever all invariant probability measures are forced to charge a common reference measure.
  Once existence of invariant probability measures is known, indecomposability alone is sufficient to rule out multiplicity. On standard Borel spaces, this viewpoint is consistent with the classical theory: irreducibility appears as a convenient sufficient condition ensuring indecomposability, rather than as a structural requirement for uniqueness.
  The resulting proofs are purely measure-theoretic and do not rely on recurrence, regeneration, return-time estimates, or regularity assumptions on the transition kernel.</description>

      <title>Analytic Regularity and Approximation Limits of Coefficient-Constrained Shallow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study approximation limits of single-hidden-layer neural networks with analytic activation functions under global coefficient constraints. Under uniform $\ell^1$ bounds, or more generally sub-exponential growth of the coefficients, we show that such networks generate model classes with strong quantitative regularity, leading to uniform analyticity of the realized functions. As a consequence, up to an exponentially small residual term, the error of best network approximation on generic target functions is bounded from below by the error of best polynomial approximation. In particular, networks with analytic activation functions with controlled coefficients cannot outperform classical polynomial approximation rates on non-analytic targets. The underlying rigidity phenomenon extends to smoother, non-analytic activations satisfying Gevrey-type regularity assumptions, yielding sub-exponential variants of the approximation barrier. The analysis is entirely deterministic and relies on a comparison argument combined with classical Bernstein-type estimates; extensions to higher dimensions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Credit Spreads' Term Structure: Stochastic Modeling with CIR++ Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stochastic model for credit spreads. The stochastic approach leverages the diffusion of default intensities via a CIR++ model and is formulated within a risk-neutral probability space. Our research primarily addresses two gaps in the literature. The first is the lack of credit spread models founded on a stochastic basis that enables continuous modeling, as many existing models rely on factorial assumptions. The second is the limited availability of models that directly yield a term structure of credit spreads. An intermediate result of our model is the provision of a term structure for the prices of defaultable bonds. We present the model alongside an innovative, practical, and conservative calibration approach that minimizes the error between historical and theoretical volatilities of default intensities. We demonstrate the robustness of both the model and its calibration process by comparing its behavior to historical credit spread values. Our findings indicate that the model not only produces realistic credit spread term structure curves but also exhibits consistent diffusion over time. Additionally, the model accurately fits the initial term structure of implied survival probabilities and provides an analytical expression for the credit spread of any given maturity at any future time.</description>

      <title>American options valuation in time-dependent jump-diffusion models via integral equations and characteristic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in machine learning for derivative pricing, the efficient and accurate valuation of American options remains a persistent challenge due to complex exercise boundaries, near-expiry behavior, and intricate contractual features. This paper extends a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models, including pure diffusions, jump-diffusions, and Levy processes. Building on prior work, we derive and solve Volterra integral equations of the second kind to determine the exercise boundary explicitly, offering a computationally superior alternative to traditional finite-difference and Monte Carlo methods. We address key open problems: (1) extending the decomposition method, i.e. splitting the American option price into its European counterpart and an early exercise premium, to general jump-diffusion and Levy models; (2) handling cases where closed-form transition densities are unavailable by leveraging characteristic functions via, e.g., the COS method; and (3) generalizing the framework to multidimensional diffusions. Numerical examples demonstrate the method's efficiency and robustness. Our results underscore the advantages of the integral equation approach for large-scale industrial applications, while resolving some limitations of existing techniques.</description>
