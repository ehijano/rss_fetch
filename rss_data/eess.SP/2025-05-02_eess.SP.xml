      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): Power Radiation Model and Optimal Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) improve wireless links by configuring the locations of activated pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides, namely pinching beamforming. In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model is proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be flexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and waveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is derived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a practical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where pinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A transmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated pinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To solve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to globally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching algorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS significantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures, particularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii) The proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, resulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing computational overheads.

      <title>Stealth Signals: Multi-Discriminator GANs for Covert Communications Against Diverse Wardens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert wireless communications are critical for concealing the existence of any transmission from adversarial wardens, particularly in complex environments with multiple heterogeneous detectors. This paper proposes a novel adversarial AI framework leveraging a multi-discriminator Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to design signals that evade detection by diverse wardens, while ensuring reliable decoding by the intended receiver. The transmitter is modeled as a generator that produces noise-like signals, while every warden is modeled as an individual discriminator, suggesting varied channel conditions and detection techniques. Unlike traditional methods like spread spectrum or single-discriminator GANs, our approach addresses multi-warden scenarios with moving receiver and wardens, which enhances robustness in urban surveillance, military operations, and 6G networks. Performance evaluation shows encouraging results with improved detection probabilities and bit error rates (BERs), in up to five warden cases, compared to noise injection and single-discriminator baselines. The scalability and flexibility of the system make it a potential candidate for future wireless secure systems, and potential future directions include real-time optimization and synergy with 6G technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Inference over Multi-hop MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints, with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>A Temporal Broadening-Aware Pulse Width Adaptation Scheme for ISI Mitigation and Energy Efficiency in THz Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication ensures the provision of ultra-high data rates owing to its abundant bandwidth; however, its performance is impeded by complex propagation mechanisms. In particular, molecular absorption induces a temporal broadening effect (TBE), which causes pulse spreading and inter-symbol interference (ISI), especially in ON-OFF keying-based systems. To address this, we propose an adaptive pulse-width transmission scheme that dynamically adjusts pulse durations based on the anticipated TBE. This approach suppresses ISI by confining energy within symbol durations while also exploiting TBE constructively to reduce pulse transmissions in specific bit patterns, leading to improved energy efficiency (EE) as an additional advantage of the proposed scheme. Analytical derivations and simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme substantially improves EE and bit error rate under practical THz channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Secure Multi-Hop Relaying in Large-Scale Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a key enabler of borderless and ubiquitous connectivity, space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSINs) are expected to be a cornerstone of 6G wireless communications. However, the multi-tiered and global-scale nature of SAGSINs also amplifies the security vulnerabilities, particularly due to the hidden, passive eavesdroppers distributed throughout the network. In this paper, we introduce a joint optimization framework for multi-hop relaying in SAGSINs that maximizes the minimum user throughput while ensuring a minimum strictly positive secure connection (SPSC) probability. We first derive a closed-form expression for the SPSC probability and incorporate this into a cross-layer optimization framework that jointly optimizes radio resources and relay routes. Specifically, we propose an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ optimal frequency allocation and power splitting strategy-dividing power levels of data transmission and cooperative jamming. We then introduce a Monte-Carlo relay routing algorithm that closely approaches the performance of the numerical upper-bound method. We validate our framework on testbeds built with real-world dataset. All source code and data for reproducing the numerical experiments will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Spreading Depolarization Detection in Electrocorticogram Spectrogram Imaging by Deep Learning: Is It Just About Delta Band?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevention of secondary brain injury is a core aim of neurocritical care, with Spreading Depolarizations (SDs) recognized as a significant independent cause. SDs are typically monitored through invasive, high-frequency electrocorticography (ECoG); however, detection remains challenging due to signal artifacts that obscure critical SD-related electrophysiological changes, such as power attenuation and DC drifting. Recent studies suggest spectrogram analysis could improve SD detection; however, brain injury patients often show power reduction across all bands except delta, causing class imbalance. Previous methods focusing solely on delta mitigates imbalance but overlooks features in other frequencies, limiting detection performance. This study explores using multi-frequency spectrogram analysis, revealing that essential SD-related features span multiple frequency bands beyond the most active delta band. This study demonstrated that further integration of both alpha and delta bands could result in enhanced SD detection accuracy by a deep learning model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changepoint localization is the problem of estimating the index at which a change occurred in the data generating distribution of an ordered list of data, or declaring that no change occurred. We present the broadly applicable CONCH (CONformal CHangepoint localization) algorithm, which uses a matrix of conformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint under the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are each exchangeable. We exemplify the CONCH algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to detect changes in sequences of images or text.</description>

      <title>Edge Large AI Models: Revolutionizing 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence (AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks. However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management. Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Vector Compressed Sensing Using James Stein Shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense, and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust, delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Wireless Federated Fine-Tuning for Large-Scale AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations. Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA}) algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and addressed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For performance benchmarking, two time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are considered: one based on the pinching antenna individually activated for each user, and the other based on the single-pinching-antenna configuration serving all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the use of the pinching antenna significantly enhances the system sum rate compared to conventional antenna architectures. Moreover, the NOMA-based scheme outperforms the TDMA-based scheme with a single pinching antenna but is outperformed by the TDMA-based approach when the pinching antenna is adaptively configured for each user. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method is shown to achieve near-optimal performance for both NOMA and TDMA with a common pinching-antenna configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and tracking objects is a crucial component of any autonomous navigation method. For the past decades, object detection has yielded promising results using neural networks on various datasets. While many methods focus on performance metrics, few projects focus on improving the robustness of these detection and tracking pipelines, notably to sensor failures. In this paper we attempt to address this issue by creating a realistic synthetic data augmentation pipeline for camera-radar Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets. Our goal is to accurately simulate sensor failures and data deterioration due to real-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight Noise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset, reaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\% on 11 categories across 10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.</description>

      <title>RIS Partitioning and User Clustering for Resilient Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing connectivity in future wireless networks. This paper designs well-connected and resilient UAV networks by deploying and virtually partitioning multiple RISs to create multiple RIS-aided links, focusing on a link-layer perspective. The RIS-aided links are created to connect user equipment (UE) to blocked and reliable UAVs, where multiple UEs can transmit to same UAV via RIS using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), granting access to UEs and maximizing network connectivity. We first derive exact and approximated closed-form expressions for signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) based on aligned and non-aligned RIS-aided beams. Then, we propose to formulate the problem of maximizing network connectivity that jointly considers (i) UE NOMA clustering, (ii) RIS-aided link selection, and (ii) virtual RIS partitioning. This problem is a computationally expensive combinatorial optimization. To tackle this problem, a two-step iterative approach, called RIS-aided NOMA, is proposed. In the first step, the UEs are clustered to the RISs according to their channel gains, while UAVs are associated to those generated clusters based on their reliability, which measures the criticality of UAVs. The second step optimally partitions the RISs to support each of the cluster members. In this step, we derive the closed-form equations for the optimal partitioning of RISs within the clusters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-aided NOMA yields a gain of 30% to 40%, respectively, compared to UAV traditional scheme. The finding emphasizes the potential of integrating RIS with UAV communications as a robust and reliable connectivity solution for future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>AI-based CSI Feedback with Digital Twins: Real-World Validation and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.</description>

      <title>Physical Limits and Optimal Synthesis of Beyond Diagonal Anomalous Scatterers</title>

Abstract: Realizing metasurfaces for anomalous scattering is fundamental to designing reflector arrays, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and metasurface antennas. However, the basic cost of steering scattering into non-specular directions is not fully understood. This paper derives tight physical bounds on anomalous scattering using antenna array systems equipped with non-local matching networks. The matching networks are explicitly synthesized based on the solutions of the optimization problems that define these bounds. Furthermore, we analyze fundamental limits for metasurface antennas implemented with metallic and dielectric materials exhibiting minimal loss within a finite design region. The results reveal a typical 6dB reduction in bistatic radar cross section (RCS) in anomalous directions compared to the forward direction. Numerical examples complement the theory and illustrate the inherent cost of achieving anomalous scattering relative to forward or specular scattering for canonical configurations.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Problem in Process of Selective Identification and Localization of Voltage Fluctuations Sources in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voltage fluctuations are common disturbances in power grids, therefore the effective and selective process of identification and localization of individual voltage fluctuations sources is necessary for the minimization of such disturbances. Selectivity in the process of identification and localization disturbing loads is possible by the use cascade of blocks: demodulation, decomposition and propagation assessment. The effectiveness of this approach is closely related to the used method of decomposition. The paper presents the problem of decomposition process for the selected method of selective identification and localization of voltage fluctuation sources, in which the algorithm of enhanced empirical wavelet transform (EEWT) is used as the decomposition method. The paper presents selected research results from the real power grid, for which the result of selected approach causes mistakes in the process of identification and localization of voltage fluctuations sources. The potential causes of such mistakes related to the decomposition process are discussed on the basis of obtained research results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion for Fractional Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distributed adaptive signal fusion (DASF) framework allows to solve spatial filtering optimization problems in a distributed and adaptive fashion over a bandwidth-constrained wireless sensor network. The DASF algorithm requires each node to sequentially build a compressed version of the original network-wide problem and solve it locally. However, these local problems can still result in a high computational load at the nodes, especially when the required solver is iterative. In this paper, we study the particular case of fractional programs, i.e., problems for which the objective function is a fraction of two continuous functions, which indeed require such iterative solvers. By exploiting the structure of a commonly used method for solving fractional programs and interleaving it with the iterations of the standard DASF algorithm, we obtain a distributed algorithm with a significantly reduced computational cost compared to the straightforward application of DASF as a meta-algorithm. We prove convergence and optimality of this "fractional DASF" (FDASF) algorithm and demonstrate its performance via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Rejuvenating IRS: AoI-based Low Overhead Reconfiguration Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technologies help mitigate undesirable effects in wireless links by steering the communication signal between transmitters and receivers. IRS elements are configured to adjust the phase of the reflected signal for a user's location and enhance the perceived signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this way, an IRS improves the communication link but inevitably introduces more communication overhead. This occurs especially in mobile scenarios, where the user's position must be frequently estimated to re-adjust the IRS elements periodically. Such an operation requires balancing the amount of training versus the data time slots to optimize the communication performance in the link. Aiming to study this balance with the age of information (AoI) framework, we address the question of how often an IRS needs to be updated with the lowest possible overhead and the maximum of freshness of information. We derive the corresponding analytical solution for a mobile scenario, where the transmitter is static and the mobile user (MU) follows a random waypoint mobility model. We provide a closed-form expression for the average peak age of information (PAoI), as a metric to evaluate the impact of the IRS update frequency. As for the performance evaluation, we consider a realistic scenario following the IEEE 802.11ad standard, targeting the mmWave band. Our results reveal that the minimum achievable average PAoI is in the microsecond range and the optimal IRS update period is in the seconds range, causing 9% overhead in the link when the MU moves at a velocity of 1 m/s.</description>

      <title>Aligning Beam with Imbalanced Multi-modality: A Generative Federated Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As vehicle intelligence advances, multi-modal sensing-aided communication emerges as a key enabler for reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity through precise environmental characterization. As centralized learning may suffer from data privacy, model heterogeneity and communication overhead issues, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to support V2X. However, the practical deployment of FL faces critical challenges: model performance degradation from label imbalance across vehicles and training instability induced by modality disparities in sensor-equipped agents. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generative FL approach for beam selection (GFL4BS). Our solution features two core innovations: 1) An adaptive zero-shot multi-modal generator coupled with spectral-regularized loss functions to enhance the expressiveness of synthetic data compensating for both label scarcity and missing modalities; 2) A hybrid training paradigm integrating feature fusion with decentralized optimization to ensure training resilience while minimizing communication costs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baselines achieving 16.2% higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art under severe label imbalance conditions while maintaining over 70% successful rate even when two agents lack both LiDAR and RGB camera inputs.</description>

      <title>Task-Agnostic Semantic Communications Relying on Information Bottleneck and Federated Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a paradigm shift towards pervasive intelligence, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potentials to improve communication efficiency and provide user-centric services by delivering task-oriented semantic meanings. However, the exponential growth in connected devices, data volumes, and communication demands presents significant challenges for practical SemCom design, particularly in resource-constrained wireless networks. In this work, we first propose a task-agnostic SemCom (TASC) framework that can handle diverse tasks with multiple modalities. Aiming to explore the interplay between communications and intelligent tasks from the information-theoretical perspective, we leverage information bottleneck (IB) theory and propose a distributed multimodal IB (DMIB) principle to learn minimal and sufficient unimodal and multimodal information effectively by discarding redundancy while preserving task-related information. To further reduce the communication overhead, we develop an adaptive semantic feature transmission method under dynamic channel conditions. Then, TASC is trained based on federated meta-learning (FML) for rapid adaptation and generalization in wireless networks. To gain deep insights, we rigorously conduct theoretical analysis and devise resource management to accelerate convergence while minimizing the training latency and energy consumption. Moreover, we develop a joint user selection and resource allocation algorithm to address the non-convex problem with theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TASC compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Accelerated First-Order Optimization under Nonlinear Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit analogies between first-order algorithms for constrained optimization and non-smooth dynamical systems to design a new class of accelerated first-order algorithms for constrained optimization. Unlike Frank-Wolfe or projected gradients, these algorithms avoid optimization over the entire feasible set at each iteration. We prove convergence to stationary points even in a nonconvex setting and we derive accelerated rates for the convex setting both in continuous time, as well as in discrete time. An important property of these algorithms is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities instead of positions, which naturally leads to sparse, local and convex approximations of the feasible set (even if the feasible set is nonconvex). Thus, the complexity tends to grow mildly in the number of decision variables and in the number of constraints, which makes the algorithms suitable for machine learning applications. We apply our algorithms to a compressed sensing and a sparse regression problem, showing that we can treat nonconvex $\ell^p$ constraints ($p&lt;1$) efficiently, while recovering state-of-the-art performance for $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Computational and Statistical Guarantees for Tensor-on-Tensor Regression with Tensor Train Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression model has been proposed to generalize tensor recovery, encompassing scenarios like scalar-on-tensor regression and tensor-on-vector regression. However, the exponential growth in tensor complexity poses challenges for storage and computation in ToT regression. To overcome this hurdle, tensor decompositions have been introduced, with the tensor train (TT)-based ToT model proving efficient in practice due to reduced memory requirements, enhanced computational efficiency, and decreased sampling complexity. Despite these practical benefits, a disparity exists between theoretical analysis and real-world performance. In this paper, we delve into the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the TT-based ToT regression model. Assuming the regression operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we conduct an error analysis for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem. This analysis includes upper error bound and minimax lower bound, revealing that such error bounds polynomially depend on the order $N+M$. To efficiently find solutions meeting such error bounds, we propose two optimization algorithms: the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm (employing gradient descent with TT-singular value decomposition (TT-SVD)) and the factorization approach using the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm. When RIP is satisfied, spectral initialization facilitates proper initialization, and we establish the linear convergence rate of both IHT and RGD.</description>

      <title>Enhancing clinical decision support with physiological waveforms -- a multimodal benchmark in emergency care</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: AI-driven prediction algorithms have the potential to enhance emergency medicine by enabling rapid and accurate decision-making regarding patient status and potential deterioration. However, the integration of multimodal data, including raw waveform signals, remains underexplored in clinical decision support. Methods: We present a dataset and benchmarking protocol designed to advance multimodal decision support in emergency care. Our models utilize demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms as inputs to predict both discharge diagnoses and patient deterioration. Results: The diagnostic model achieves area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) scores above 0.8 for 609 out of 1,428 conditions, covering both cardiac (e.g., myocardial infarction) and non-cardiac (e.g., renal disease, diabetes) diagnoses. The deterioration model attains AUROC scores above 0.8 for 14 out of 15 targets, accurately predicting critical events such as cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and mortality. Conclusions: Our study highlights the positive impact of incorporating raw waveform data into decision support models, improving predictive performance. By introducing a unique, publicly available dataset and baseline models, we provide a foundation for measurable progress in AI-driven decision support for emergency care.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question.
  In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\geq 3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is sufficient for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO.</description>

      <title>Seamless Optical Cloud Computing across Edge-Metro Network for Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles, necessitating a revolutionary architecture to support the growing demands for computational power. Cloud computing has become the driving force behind this transformation. However, it consumes significant power and faces computation security risks due to the reliance on extensive data centers and servers in the cloud. Reducing power consumption while enhancing computational scale remains persistent challenges in cloud computing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical cloud computing system that can be seamlessly deployed across edge-metro network. By modulating inputs and models into light, a wide range of edge nodes can directly access the optical computing center via the edge-metro network. The experimental validations show an energy efficiency of 118.6 mW/TOPs (tera operations per second), reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional electronic-based cloud computing solutions. Furthermore, it is experimentally validated that this architecture can perform various complex generative AI models through parallel computing to achieve image generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.</description>
