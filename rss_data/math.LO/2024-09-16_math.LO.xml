      <title>Undecidability and incompleteness in quantum information theory and operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey a number of incompleteness results in operator algebras stemming from the recent undecidability result in quantum complexity theory known as $\operatorname{MIP}^*=\operatorname{RE}$, the most prominent of which is the G\"odelian refutation of the Connes Embedding Problem. We also discuss the very recent use of $\operatorname{MIP}^*=\operatorname{RE}$ in refuting the Aldous-Lyons conjecture in probability theory.</description>

      <title>Borel graphable equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of analytic equivalence relations which are Borel graphable, i.e. which can be realized as the connectedness relation of a Borel graph. Our main focus is the question of which analytic equivalence relations are Borel graphable. First, we study an equivalence relation arising from the theory of countable admissible ordinals and show that it is Borel graphable if and only if there is a non-constructible real. As a corollary of the proof, we construct an analytic equivalence relation which is (provably in ZFC) not Borel graphable and an effectively analytic equivalence relation which is Borel graphable but not effectively Borel graphable. Next, we study analytic equivalence relations given by the isomorphism relation for some class of countable structures. We show that all such equivalence relations are Borel graphable, which implies that for every Borel action of $S_\infty$, the associated orbit equivalence relation is Borel graphable. This leads us to study the class of Polish groups whose Borel actions always give rise to Borel graphable orbit equivalence relations; we refer to such groups as graphic groups. We show that besides $S_\infty$, the class of graphic groups includes all connected Polish groups and is closed under countable products. We finish by studying structural properties of the class of Borel graphable analytic equivalence relations and by considering two variations on Borel graphability: a generalization with hypegraphs instead of graphs and an analogue of Borel graphability in the setting of computably enumerable equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Tropicalization through the lens of {\L}ukasiewicz logic, with a topos theoretic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to show that the topics of {\L}ukasiewicz logic, semirings and tropical structures fruitfully meet. This gives rise to a topos theoretic perspective to {\L}ukasiewicz logic. A functorial tropicalization of MV-algebras in the variety V(C) is proposed. We further consider a logic based on perfect MV-algebras and having truth values that are perturbations of boolean values, and we show how this logic can exhibit models functorially connected with points of a non-commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Topics, Non-Uniform Substitutions, and Variable Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of relevant logics can be faceted by a hierarchy of increasingly fine-grained variable sharing properties -- requiring that in valid entailments $A\to B$, some atom must appear in both $A$ and $B$ with some additional condition (e.g., with the same sign or nested within the same number of conditionals). In this paper, we consider an incredibly strong variable sharing property of lericone relevance that takes into account the path of negations and conditionals in which an atom appears in the parse trees of the antecedent and consequent. We show that this property of lericone relevance holds of the relevant logic $\mathbf{BM}$ (and that a related property of faithful lericone relevance holds of $\mathbf{B}$) and characterize the largest fragments of classical logic with these properties. Along the way, we consider the consequences for lericone relevance for the theory of subject-matter, for Logan's notion of hyperformalism, and for the very definition of a relevant logic itself.</description>

      <title>Quasivarieties of p-algebras: some new results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quasivarieties of (distributive) p-algebras. We sharpen some previous results, give a better picture of the subquasivariety lattice, and prove that quasivarieties generated by free p-algebras belong to a rather small quasivariety characterised by excluding all but 3 subdirectly irreducibles.</description>

      <title>Decidable varieties of p-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for quasivarieties of p-algebras the properties of (i) having decidable first-order theory and (ii) having decidable first-order theory of the finite members, coincide. The only two quasivarieties with these properties are the trivial variety and the variety of Boolean algebras. This contrasts sharply, even for varieties, with the situation in Heyting algebras where decidable varieties do not coincide with finitely decidable ones.</description>
