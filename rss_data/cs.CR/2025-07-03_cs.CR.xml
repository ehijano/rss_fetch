      <title>A Systematic Review of Security Vulnerabilities in Smart Home Devices and Mitigation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart homes that integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices face increasing cybersecurity risks, posing significant challenges to these environments. The study explores security threats in smart homes ecosystems, categorizing them into vulnerabilities at the network layer, device level, and those from cloud-based and AI-driven systems. Research findings indicate that post-quantum encryption, coupled with AI-driven anomaly detection, is highly effective in enhancing security; however, computational resource demands present significant challenges. Blockchain authentication together with zero-trust structures builds security resilience, although they need changes to existing infrastructure. The specific security strategies show their effectiveness through ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations yet lack sufficient scalability according to the results. The research demonstrates the requirement for improvement in cryptographic techniques, alongside AI-enhanced threat detection and adaptive security models which must achieve a balance between performance and efficiency and real-time applicability within smart home ecosystems.</description>

      <title>AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities to jailbreaking attacks: carefully crafted malicious inputs intended to circumvent safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. As such, we present AutoAdv, a novel framework that automates adversarial prompt generation to systematically evaluate and expose vulnerabilities in LLM safety mechanisms. Our approach leverages a parametric attacker LLM to produce semantically disguised malicious prompts through strategic rewriting techniques, specialized system prompts, and optimized hyperparameter configurations. The primary contribution of our work is a dynamic, multi-turn attack methodology that analyzes failed jailbreak attempts and iteratively generates refined follow-up prompts, leveraging techniques such as roleplaying, misdirection, and contextual manipulation. We quantitatively evaluate attack success rate (ASR) using the StrongREJECT (arXiv:2402.10260 [cs.CL]) framework across sequential interaction turns. Through extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models--including ChatGPT, Llama, and DeepSeek--we reveal significant vulnerabilities, with our automated attacks achieving jailbreak success rates of up to 86% for harmful content generation. Our findings reveal that current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to sophisticated multi-turn attacks, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust defense strategies.</description>

      <title>Quasi-twisted codes: decoding and applications in code-based cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-twisted (QT) codes generalize several important families of linear codes, including cyclic, constacyclic, and quasi-cyclic codes. Despite their potential, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no efficient decoding algorithm for QT codes. In this work, we propose a syndrome-based decoding method capable of efficiently correcting up to (d* - 1)/2 errors, where d* denotes an HT-like lower bound on the minimum distance of QT codes, which we formalize here. Additionally, we introduce a Niederreiter-like cryptosystem constructed from QT codes. This cryptosystem is resistant to some classical attacks as well as some quantum attacks based on Quantum Fourier Sampling.</description>

      <title>A Compact 16-bit S-box over Tower Field $\F_{(((2^2)^2)^2)^2}$ with High Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a compact and secure 16-bit substitution box (S-box) designed over the composite field $\F_{(((2^2)^2)^2)^2}$, optimized for both hardware efficiency and cryptographic robustness. The proposed S-box decomposes operations into subfields, leveraging a tower field architecture. This enables significant hardware reduction through optimized field inversion and a low-cost affine transformation. Security evaluations confirm resilience against linear, differential, algebraic and DPA attacks, validated via metrics including Nonlinearity (32512), Differential Uniformity (4), Algebraic Degree (15), Transparency order (15.9875) and SNR (0.34e-08). The hardware results, in 65 nm CMOS technology, show the proposed 16-bit S-box has lower hardware resources consumption and lower critical path delay (CPD) than those of other 16-bit S-boxes. By integrating high algebraic complexity with resource-efficient structures, this work addresses the growing demand for scalable cryptographic primitives in data-sensitive applications, demonstrating that larger S-boxes can enhance security without proportional hardware costs. The results underscore the viability of composite field-based architectures in balancing security and efficiency for modern block ciphers.</description>

      <title>A new efficient RPKI Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a critical security mechanism for BGP, but the complexity of its architecture is a growing concern as its adoption scales. Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such as X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols, all these introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and inefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design choices, although based on established standards, create significant performance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder scalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.
  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of complexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world impact. We show that over 70% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is spent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it unnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI), a backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while substantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and ROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose encodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more efficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of iRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time, 18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory footprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to at least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the feasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in constrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without impacting existing operations.</description>

      <title>How to Securely Shuffle? A survey about Secure Shufflers for privacy-preserving computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ishai et al. (FOCS'06) introduced secure shuffling as an efficient building block for private data aggregation. Recently, the field of differential privacy has revived interest in secure shufflers by highlighting the privacy amplification they can provide in various computations. Although several works argue for the utility of secure shufflers, they often treat them as black boxes; overlooking the practical vulnerabilities and performance trade-offs of existing implementations. This leaves a central question open: what makes a good secure shuffler?
  This survey addresses that question by identifying, categorizing, and comparing 26 secure protocols that realize the necessary shuffling functionality. To enable a meaningful comparison, we adapt and unify existing security definitions into a consistent set of properties. We also present an overview of privacy-preserving technologies that rely on secure shufflers, offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate protocols, and outline promising directions for future work.</description>

      <title>SafePTR: Token-Level Jailbreak Defense in Multimodal LLMs via Prune-then-Restore Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By incorporating visual inputs, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to support visual reasoning. However, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods, including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs' built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating jailbreak risks without compromising utility.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity Issues in Local Energy Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local Energy Markets (LEMs), though pivotal to the energy transition, face growing cybersecurity threats due to their reliance on smart grid communication standards and vulnerable Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices. This is a critical issue because such vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate market operations, compromise participants' privacy, and destabilize power distribution networks. This work maps LEM communication flows to existing standards, highlights potential impacts of key identified vulnerabilities, and simulates cyberattack scenarios on a privacy-preserving LEM model to assess their impacts. Findings reveal how attackers could distort pricing and demand patterns. We finally present recommendations for researchers, industry developers, policymakers, and LEM stakeholders to secure future LEM deployments.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Ruleset Tuning and Data Imbalance on Explainable Network Security Alert Classifications: a Case-Study on DeepCASE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automation in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) plays a prominent role in alert classification and incident escalation. However, automated methods must be robust in the presence of imbalanced input data, which can negatively affect performance. Additionally, automated methods should make explainable decisions. In this work, we evaluate the effect of label imbalance on the classification of network intrusion alerts. As our use-case we employ DeepCASE, the state-of-the-art method for automated alert classification. We show that label imbalance impacts both classification performance and correctness of the classification explanations offered by DeepCASE. We conclude tuning the detection rules used in SOCs can significantly reduce imbalance and may benefit the performance and explainability offered by alert post-processing methods such as DeepCASE. Therefore, our findings suggest that traditional methods to improve the quality of input data can benefit automation.</description>

      <title>EGNInfoLeaker: Unveiling the Risks of Public Key Reuse and User Identity Leakage in Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Ethereum's discovery protocols (Discv4/ Discv5) incorporate robust cryptographic designs to protect user privacy, real-world deployment reveals critical vulnerabilities when users deviate from security guidelines. In this paper, we design a system called EGNInfoLeaker. Our study is the first work that uncovers widespread public key reuse across Ethereum's peer-to-peer networks - a practice that fundamentally undermines the protocol's privacy guarantees. Through systematic analysis of 300 real-world network snapshots, we identify 83 users controlling 483 service nodes via public key reuse, enabling precise de-anonymization through IP correlation. Using evidence collected by EGNInfoLeaker, our Graph-Based Identity Association Algorithm links users to network entities and generates comprehensive user profiles. For User27, it exposes the public key, IP, network ID, location (country/region/city), and ISP/ORG details. The EGNInfoLeaker system demonstrates how such cryptographic misuse transforms theoretical anonymity into practical identity leakage, exposing users to surveillance and targeted attacks. These findings establish that protocol security depends not only on sound design but also on strict user compliance. Going forward, our detection framework provides a foundation for enhancing real-world privacy preservation in decentralized networks.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation-based Model Poisoning on Federated LLMs in CyberEdge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated large language models (FedLLMs) provide powerful generative capabilities in CyberEdge networks while protecting data privacy. However, FedLLMs remains highly vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, highlighting critical limitations, particularly under non-IID text distributions. In particular, current defenses primarily utilize distance-based outlier detection or norm constraints, operating under the assumption that adversarial updates significantly diverge from benign statistics. This assumption can fail when facing adaptive attackers targeting billionparameter LLMs. Next, this article investigates emerging Graph Representation-Based Model Poisoning (GRMP), a novel attack paradigm that leverages higher-order correlations among honest client gradients to synthesize malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate model updates. GRMP can effectively evade advanced defenses, resulting in substantial accuracy loss and performance degradation. Moreover, this article outlines a research roadmap emphasizing the importance of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, FedLLMs-specific vulnerability metrics, and evaluation frameworks to strengthen the robustness of future federated language model deployments.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Attribute Inference Vulnerability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of anonymizing structured data is to protect the privacy of individuals in the data while retaining the statistical properties of the data. An important class of attack on anonymized data is attribute inference, where an attacker infers the value of an unknown attribute of a target individual given knowledge of one or more known attributes. A major limitation of recent attribute inference measures is that they do not take recall into account, only precision. It is often the case that attacks target only a fraction of individuals, for instance data outliers. Incorporating recall, however, substantially complicates the measure, because one must determine how to combine recall and precision in a composite measure for both the attack and baseline. This paper presents the design and implementation of an attribute inference measure that incorporates both precision and recall. Our design also improves on how the baseline attribute inference is computed. In experiments using a generic best row match attack on moderately-anonymized microdata, we show that in over 25\% of the attacks, our approach correctly labeled the attack to be at risk while the prior approach incorrectly labeled the attack to be safe.</description>

      <title>Signals and Symptoms: ICS Attack Dataset From Railway Cyber Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of cyberattacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has highlighted the necessity for robust security measures and incident response to protect critical infrastructure. This is prominent when Operational Technology (OT) systems undergo digital transformation by integrating with Information Technology (IT) systems to enhance operational efficiency, adaptability, and safety. To support analysts in staying abreast of emerging attack patterns, there is a need for ICS datasets that reflect indicators representative of contemporary cyber threats. To address this, we conduct two ICS cyberattack simulations to showcase the impact of trending ICS cyberattacks on a railway cyber range that resembles the railway infrastructure. The attack scenario is designed to blend trending attack trends with attack patterns observed from historical ICS incidents. The resulting evidence is collected as datasets, serving as an essential resource for cyberattack analysis. This captures key indicators that are relevant to the current threat landscape, augmenting the effectiveness of security systems and analysts to protect against ICS cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Empowering Manufacturers with Privacy-Preserving AI Tools: A Case Study in Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning to Solve Real-World Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small- and medium-sized manufacturers need innovative data tools but, because of competition and privacy concerns, often do not want to share their proprietary data with researchers who might be interested in helping. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may safely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those researchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world problems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform for others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate this problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem in the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality control relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals in the images were manually counted, which required substantial and time-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal analysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool enables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers from microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample preparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high resolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also developed to aid in these efforts. The resulting algorithm was then packaged for real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the originating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while keeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process, future directions are also explored.</description>

      <title>On Design Principles for Private Adaptive Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private (DP) training undermines the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and Adam, and hence many recent works have proposed algorithms to address this challenge. However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which are more desirable to use in practice.</description>

      <title>FlashDP: Private Training Large Language Models with Efficient DP-SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern. Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data, yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus, necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods. Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a \textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in https://github.com/kaustpradalab/flashdp.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Intrusion Detection for Automotive Ethernet: Evaluating &amp; Optimizing Fast Inference Techniques for Deployment on Low-Cost Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly connected, and in this context, automotive Ethernet is one of the technologies that promise to provide the necessary infrastructure for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are subject to attacks that can compromise safety, including flow injection attacks. Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often designed to combat this problem, but they require expensive hardware to run in real time. In this work, we propose to evaluate and apply fast neural network inference techniques like Distilling and Prunning for deploying IDS models on low-cost platforms in real time. The results show that these techniques can achieve intrusion detection times of up to 727 {\mu}s using a Raspberry Pi 4, with AUCROC values of 0.9890.</description>

      <title>PAE MobiLLM: Privacy-Aware and Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning on the Mobile Device via Additive Side-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Quantum Distribution Learning and Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of one-way functions (OWFs) forms the minimal assumption in classical cryptography. However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum cryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer, provide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies $PP\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the analogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \neq NP$-has long been studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning in various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to $P \neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for OWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of OWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution learning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper quantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that follows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution learning can be derived from $PP \neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to average-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from $PP \neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if worst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite that, we show that $PP \neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of hardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \neq BQP$ if and only if agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard. As a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\Sigma_3^P}$ learners implies $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$.</description>

      <title>ICLShield: Exploring and Mitigating In-Context Learning Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature. However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects, revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).</description>

      <title>Rational Censorship Attack: Breaking Blockchain with a Blackboard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Censorship resilience is a fundamental assumption underlying the security of blockchain protocols. Additionally, the analysis of blockchain security from an economic and game theoretic perspective has been growing in popularity in recent years. In this work, we present a surprising rational censorship attack on blockchain censorship resilience when we adopt the analysis of blockchain security from a game theoretic lens and assume all users are rational. In our attack, a colluding group with sufficient voting power censors the remainder nodes such that the group alone can gain all the rewards from maintaining the blockchain. We show that if nodes are rational, coordinating this attack just requires a public read and write blackboard and we formally model the attack using a game theoretic framework. Furthermore, we note that to ensure the success of the attack, nodes need to know the total true voting power held by the colluding group. We prove that the strategy to join the rational censorship attack and also for nodes to honestly declare their power is a subgame perfect equilibrium in the corresponding extensive form game induced by our attack. Finally, we discuss the implications of the attack on blockchain users and protocol designers as well as some potential countermeasures.</description>

      <title>A Privacy-Preserving Indoor Localization System based on Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically require central data aggregation, leading to privacy, bandwidth, and server reliability issues. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy, bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor localization systems.</description>

      <title>Survivability of Backdoor Attacks on Unconstrained Face Recognition Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Tuning without Peeking: Provable Privacy and Generalization Bounds for LLM Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A learned database system uses machine learning (ML) internally to improve performance. We can expect such systems to be vulnerable to some adversarial-ML attacks. Often, the learned component is shared between mutually-distrusting users or processes, much like microarchitectural resources such as caches, potentially giving rise to highly-realistic attacker models. However, compared to attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as they cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the difference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of the same system is often subtle. These factors obfuscate the de-facto risks that the incorporation of ML carries. We analyze the root causes of potentially-increased attack surface in learned database systems and develop a framework for identifying vulnerabilities that stem from the use of ML. We apply our framework to a broad set of learned components currently being explored in the database community. To empirically validate the vulnerabilities surfaced by our framework, we choose 3 of them and implement and evaluate exploits against these. We show that the use of ML cause leakage of past queries in a database, enable a poisoning attack that causes exponential memory blowup in an index structure and crashes it in seconds, and enable index users to snoop on each others' key distributions by timing queries over their own keys. We find that adversarial ML is an universal threat against learned components in database systems, point to open research gaps in our understanding of learned-systems security, and conclude by discussing mitigations, while noting that data leakage is inherent in systems whose learned component is shared between multiple parties.</description>

      <title>Slot: Provenance-Driven APT Detection through Graph Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent sophisticated cyberattacks characterized by their ability to remain undetected within the victim system for extended periods, aiming to exfiltrate sensitive data or disrupt operations. Existing detection approaches often struggle to effectively identify these complex threats, construct the attack chain for defense facilitation, or resist adversarial attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Slot, an advanced APT detection approach based on provenance graphs and graph reinforcement learning. Slot excels in uncovering multi-level hidden relationships, such as causal, contextual, and indirect connections, among system behaviors through provenance graph mining. By pioneering the integration of graph reinforcement learning, Slot dynamically adapts to new user activities and evolving attack strategies, enhancing its resilience against adversarial attacks. Additionally, Slot automatically constructs the attack chain according to detected attacks with clustering algorithms, providing precise identification of attack paths and facilitating the development of defense strategies. Evaluations with real-world datasets demonstrate Slot's outstanding accuracy, efficiency, adaptability, and robustness in APT detection, with most metrics surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, case studies conducted to assess Slot's effectiveness in supporting APT defense further establish it as a practical and reliable tool for cybersecurity protection.</description>

      <title>GenBFA: An Evolutionary Optimization Approach to Bit-Flip Attacks on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13757v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning with Strategic Selection and Forgetting for Network Intrusion Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for safeguarding digital infrastructure. In dynamic network environments, both threat landscapes and normal operational behaviors are constantly changing, resulting in concept drift. While continuous learning mitigates the adverse effects of concept drift, insufficient attention to drift patterns and excessive preservation of outdated knowledge can still hinder the IDS's adaptability. In this paper, we propose SSF (Strategic Selection and Forgetting), a novel continual learning method for IDS, providing continuous model updates with a constantly refreshed memory buffer. Our approach features a strategic sample selection algorithm to select representative new samples and a strategic forgetting mechanism to drop outdated samples. The proposed strategic sample selection algorithm prioritizes new samples that cause the `drifted' pattern, enabling the model to better understand the evolving landscape. Additionally, we introduce strategic forgetting upon detecting significant drift by discarding outdated samples to free up memory, allowing the incorporation of more recent data. SSF captures evolving patterns effectively and ensures the model is aligned with the change of data patterns, significantly enhancing the IDS's adaptability to concept drift. The state-of-the-art performance of SSF on NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets demonstrates its superior adaptability to concept drift for network intrusion detection.

      <title>Distributional Information Embedding: A Framework for Multi-bit Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel problem, distributional information embedding, motivated by the practical demands of multi-bit watermarking for large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional information embedding, which embeds information into a pre-existing host signal, LLM watermarking actively controls the text generation process--adjusting the token distribution--to embed a detectable signal. We develop an information-theoretic framework to analyze this distributional information embedding problem, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs among three critical performance metrics: text quality, detectability, and information rate. In the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate that the maximum achievable rate with vanishing error corresponds to the entropy of the LLM's output distribution and increases with higher allowable distortion. We also characterize the optimal watermarking scheme to achieve this rate. Extending the analysis to the finite-token case with non-i.i.d. tokens, we identify schemes that maximize detection probability while adhering to constraints on false alarm and distortion.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Address Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many blockchains, e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the primary representation used for wallet addresses is a hardly memorable 40-digit hexadecimal string. As a result, users often select addresses from their recent transaction history, which enables blockchain address poisoning. The adversary first generates lookalike addresses similar to one with which the victim has previously interacted, and then engages with the victim to ``poison'' their transaction history. The goal is to have the victim mistakenly send tokens to the lookalike address, as opposed to the intended recipient. Compared to contemporary studies, this paper provides four notable contributions. First, we develop a detection system and perform measurements over two years on both Ethereum and BSC. We identify 13~times more attack attempts than reported previously -- totaling 270M on-chain attacks targeting 17M victims. 6,633 incidents have caused at least 83.8M USD in losses, which makes blockchain address poisoning one of the largest cryptocurrency phishing schemes observed in the wild. Second, we analyze a few large attack entities using improved clustering techniques, and model attacker profitability and competition. Third, we reveal attack strategies -- targeted populations, success conditions (address similarity, timing), and cross-chain attacks. Fourth, we mathematically define and simulate the lookalike address generation process across various software- and hardware-based implementations, and identify a large-scale attacker group that appears to use GPUs. We also discuss defensive countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Local Frames: Exploiting Inherited Origins to Bypass Content Blockers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of how local frames (i.e., iframes loading content like "about:blank") are mishandled by a wide range of popular Web security and privacy tools. As a result, users of these tools remain vulnerable to the very attack techniques against which they seek to protect themselves, including browser fingerprinting, cookie-based tracking, and data exfiltration. The tools we study are vulnerable in different ways, but all share a root cause: legacy Web functionality interacts with browser privacy boundaries in unexpected ways, leading to systemic vulnerabilities in tools developed, maintained, and recommended by privacy experts and activists.
  We consider four core capabilities supported by most privacy tools and develop tests to determine whether each can be evaded through the use of local frames. We apply our tests to six popular Web privacy and security tools -- identifying at least one vulnerability in each for a total of 19 -- and extract common patterns regarding their mishandling of local frames. Our measurement of popular websites finds that 56% employ local frames and that 73.7% of the requests made by these local frames should be blocked by popular filter lists but instead trigger the vulnerabilities we identify. From another perspective, 14.3% of all sites that we crawl make requests that should be blocked inside of local frames. We disclosed these vulnerabilities to the tool authors and discuss both our experiences working with them to patch their products and the implications of our findings for other privacy and security research.</description>

      <title>Screen Hijack: Visual Poisoning of VLM Agents in Mobile Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs), mobile agents are now widely used for tasks like UI automation and camera-based user assistance. These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms in their training pipelines.</description>

      <title>A Survey of LLM-Driven AI Agent Communication: Protocols, Security Risks, and Defense Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Large-Language-Model-driven AI agents have exhibited unprecedented intelligence and adaptability, and are rapidly changing human production and life. Nowadays, agents are undergoing a new round of evolution. They no longer act as an isolated island like LLMs. Instead, they start to communicate with diverse external entities, such as other agents and tools, to perform more complex tasks collectively. Under this trend, agent communication is regarded as a foundational pillar of the future AI ecosystem, and many organizations have intensively begun to design related communication protocols (e.g., Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A) within the recent few months. However, this new field exposes significant security hazards, which can cause severe damage to real-world scenarios. To help researchers quickly figure out this promising topic and benefit the future agent communication development, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of agent communication security. More precisely, we first present a clear definition of agent communication and categorize the entire lifecycle of agent communication into three stages: user-agent interaction, agent-agent communication, and agent-environment communication. Next, for each communication phase, we dissect related protocols and analyze the security risks according to the communication characteristics. Then, we summarize and outlook on the possible defense countermeasures for each risk. In addition, we conduct experiments using MCP and A2A to help readers better understand the novel vulnerabilities brought by agent communication. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions in this promising research field.</description>

      <title>A Practical and Secure Byzantine Robust Aggregator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In machine learning security, one is often faced with the problem of removing outliers from a given set of high-dimensional vectors when computing their average. For example, many variants of data poisoning attacks produce gradient vectors during training that are outliers in the distribution of clean gradients, which bias the computed average used to derive the ML model. Filtering them out before averaging serves as a generic defense strategy. Byzantine robust aggregation is an algorithmic primitive which computes a robust average of vectors, in the presence of an $\epsilon$ fraction of vectors which may have been arbitrarily and adaptively corrupted, such that the resulting bias in the final average is provably bounded.
  In this paper, we give the first robust aggregator that runs in quasi-linear time in the size of input vectors and provably has near-optimal bias bounds. Our algorithm also does not assume any knowledge of the distribution of clean vectors, nor does it require pre-computing any filtering thresholds from it. This makes it practical to use directly in standard neural network training procedures. We empirically confirm its expected runtime efficiency and its effectiveness in nullifying 10 different ML poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Privacy and Security as Drivers for Environmental Sustainability in Cloud-Based Office Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intersection of privacy, security, and environmental sustainability in cloud-based office solutions, focusing on quantifying user- and network-side energy use and associated carbon emissions. We hypothesise that privacy-focused services are typically more energy-efficient than those funded through data collection and advertising. To evaluate this, we propose a framework that systematically measures environmental costs based on energy usage and network data traffic during well-defined, automated usage scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we first analyse how underlying architectures and business models, such as monetisation through personalised advertising, contribute to the environmental footprint of these services. We then explore existing methodologies and tools for software environmental impact assessment. We apply our framework to three mainstream email services selected to reflect different privacy policies, from ad-supported tracking-intensive models to privacy-focused designs: Microsoft Outlook, Google Mail (Gmail), and Proton Mail. We extend this comparison to a self-hosted email solution, evaluated with and without end-to-end encryption. We show that the self-hosted solution, even with 14% of device energy and 15% of emissions overheads from PGP encryption, remains the most energy-efficient, saving up to 33% of emissions per session compared to Gmail. Among commercial providers, Proton Mail is the most efficient, saving up to 0.1 gCO2 e per session compared to Outlook, whose emissions can be further reduced by 2% through ad-blocking.</description>

      <title>Backdooring Bias (B^2) into Stable Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large text-conditional diffusion models have revolutionized image generation by enabling users to create realistic, high-quality images from textual prompts, significantly enhancing artistic creation and visual communication. However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier ($10-$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Is merging worth it? Securely evaluating the information gain for causal dataset acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merging datasets across institutions is a lengthy and costly procedure, especially when it involves private information. Data hosts may therefore want to prospectively gauge which datasets are most beneficial to merge with, without revealing sensitive information. For causal estimation this is particularly challenging as the value of a merge depends not only on reduction in epistemic uncertainty but also on improvement in overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the first cryptographically secure information-theoretic approach for quantifying the value of a merge in the context of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We do this by evaluating the Expected Information Gain (EIG) using multi-party computation to ensure that no raw data is revealed. We further demonstrate that our approach can be combined with differential privacy (DP) to meet arbitrary privacy requirements whilst preserving more accurate computation compared to DP alone. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first privacy-preserving method for dataset acquisition tailored to causal estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method on a range of simulated and realistic benchmarks.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a pivotal approach for safeguarding individual privacy in data analysis, yet its practical adoption is often hindered by challenges in the implementation and communication of DP. This paper presents a comprehensive systematization of existing research studies around the usability of DP, synthesizing insights from studies on both the practical use of DP tools and strategies for conveying DP parameters that determine privacy protection levels, such as epsilon($\varepsilon$). By reviewing and analyzing these studies, we identify core usability challenges, best practices, and critical gaps in current DP tools that affect adoption across diverse user groups, including developers, data analysts, and non-technical stakeholders. Our analysis highlights actionable insights and pathways for future research that emphasizes user-centered design and clear communication, fostering the development of more accessible DP tools that meet practical needs and support broader adoption.</description>

      <title>A Baseline Method for Removing Invisible Image Watermarks using Deep Image Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image watermarks have been considered a promising technique to help detect AI-generated content, which can be used to protect copyright or prevent fake image abuse. In this work, we present a black-box method for removing invisible image watermarks, without the need of any dataset of watermarked images or any knowledge about the watermark system. Our approach is simple to implement: given a single watermarked image, we regress it by deep image prior (DIP). We show that from the intermediate steps of DIP one can reliably find an evasion image that can remove invisible watermarks while preserving high image quality. Due to its unique working mechanism and practical effectiveness, we advocate including DIP as a baseline invasion method for benchmarking the robustness of watermarking systems. Finally, by showing the limited ability of DIP and other existing black-box methods in evading training-based visible watermarks, we discuss the positive implications on the practical use of training-based visible watermarks to prevent misinformation abuse.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Boundaries of Long-Context LLM Inference: Adaptive KV Management on a Single Commodity GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of complex and long-context natural language tasks. However, performing long-context LLM inference locally on a commodity GPU (a PC) with privacy concerns remains challenging due to the increasing memory demands of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing systems typically identify important tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory. The KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a commodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation overhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the first efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single commodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system employs an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into variable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights across different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission overheads. Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which minimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of each chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the dynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference. Experimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference latency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality. In scenarios with larger batch sizes, it achieves up to a 5.47x speedup.</description>
