      <title>Extending cycles to the coHochschild complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the chains C of a simplicial complex, we provide an explicit chain map to the coHochschild complex cCH(C,C) of C. Applying this map to a fundamental cycle of a manifold, yields a non-degenerate homotopy inner product, i.e., a weak Calabi-Yau structure. This can be used, for example, as the starting point for defining string topology operations in an algebraic setting. We apply this to the case of the 2-sphere, extending an earlier construction from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients.</description>

      <title>Primitive path homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a primitive path homology theory on the category of simple digraphs. On the subcategory of asymmetric digraphs, this theory coincides with the path homology theory which was introduced by Grigor'yan, Lin, Muranov, and Yau, but these theories are different in general case. We study properties of the primitive path homology and describe relations between the primitive path homology and the path homology. Let $a,b$ two different vertices of a digraph. Our approach gives a possibility to construct primitive homology theories of paths which have a given tail vertex $a$ or (and) a given head vertex $b$. We study these theories and describe also relationships between them and the path homology theory.</description>

      <title>Topology-Preserving Scaling in Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithmic framework for dataset normalization in data augmentation pipelines that preserves topological stability under non-uniform scaling transformations. Given a finite metric space \( X \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) with Euclidean distance \( d_X \), we consider scaling transformations defined by scaling factors \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n &gt; 0 \). Specifically, we define a scaling function \( S \) that maps each point \( x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in X \) to \[ S(x) = (s_1 x_1, s_2 x_2, \ldots, s_n x_n). \] Our main result establishes that the bottleneck distance \( d_B(D, D_S) \) between the persistence diagrams \( D \) of \( X \) and \( D_S \) of \( S(X) \) satisfies: \[ d_B(D, D_S) \leq (s_{\max} - s_{\min}) \cdot \operatorname{diam}(X), \] where \( s_{\min} = \min_{1 \leq i \leq n} s_i \), \( s_{\max} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} s_i \), and \( \operatorname{diam}(X) \) is the diameter of \( X \). Based on this theoretical guarantee, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the scaling variability \( \Delta_s = s_{\max} - s_{\min} \) under the constraint \( d_B(D, D_S) \leq \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon &gt; 0 \) is a user-defined tolerance.
  We develop an algorithmic solution to this problem, ensuring that data augmentation via scaling transformations preserves essential topological features. We further extend our analysis to higher-dimensional homological features, alternative metrics such as the Wasserstein distance, and iterative or probabilistic scaling scenarios. Our contributions provide a rigorous mathematical framework for dataset normalization in data augmentation pipelines, ensuring that essential topological characteristics are maintained despite scaling transformations.</description>

      <title>Curved $\infty$-Local Systems And Projectively Flat Riemann-Hilbert Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence in the presence of scalar curvature for a (possibly non-compact) smooth manifold $M$. We show that the dg-category of curved $\infty$-local systems, the dg-category of graded vector bundles with projectively flat $\mathbb Z$-graded connections and the dg-category of curved representations of the singular simplicial set of the based loop space of $M$ are all $A_\infty$-quasi equivalent. They provide dg-enhancements of the subcategory of the bounded derived category of twisted sheaves whose cohomology sheaves are locally constant and have finite-dimensional fibers. In the ungraded case, we reduce to an equivalence between projectively flat vector bundles and a subcategory of projective representations of $\pi_1(M; x_0)$. As an application of our general framework, we also prove that the category of cohesive modules over the curved Dolbeault algebra of a complex manifold $X$ is equivalent to a subcategory of the bounded derived category of twisted sheaves of $\mathcal O_X$-modules which generalizes a theorem due to Block to possibly non-compact complex manifolds.</description>

      <title>Topological Approach for Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models. Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz system as an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Khovanov homology has been the subject of much study in knot theory and low dimensional topology since 2000. This work introduces a Khovanov Laplacian to study knot and link diagrams. The harmonic spectrum of the Khovanov Laplacian retains the topological invariants of Khovanov homology, while its non-harmonic spectrum reveals additional information that is distinct from Khovanov homology.</description>

      <title>Decomposing zero-dimensional persistent homology over rooted tree quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a functor from any category into the category of topological spaces, one obtains a linear representation of the category by post-composing the given functor with a homology functor with field coefficients. This construction is fundamental in persistence theory, where it is known as persistent homology, and where the category is typically a poset. Persistence theory is particularly successful when the poset is a finite linearly ordered set, owing to the fact that in this case its category of representations is of finite type. We show that when the poset is a rooted tree poset (a poset with a maximum and whose Hasse diagram is a tree) the additive closure of the category of representations obtainable as zero-dimensional persistent homology is of finite type, and give a quadratic-time algorithm for decomposition into indecomposables. In doing this, we give an algebraic characterization of the additive closure in terms of Ringel's tree modules, and show that its indecomposable objects are the reduced representations of Kinser.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of templicial vector spaces was put forth in arXiv:2302.02484v2 as a suitable generalization of simplicial sets in order to develop a theory of enriched quasi-categories, called quasi-categories in vector spaces. We construct a lift of Faonte's $A_{\infty}$-nerve arXiv:1312.2127v2 which lands in templicial vector spaces. Further, we show that when restricted to dg-categories, this nerve recovers the templicial dg-nerve of arXiv:2005.04778v4, and that the nerve of any $A_{\infty}$-category is a quasi-category in vector spaces.</description>

Abstract: We propose three completely data-driven methods for estimating the real cohomology groups $H^k (X ; \mathbb{R})$ of a compact metric-measure space $(X, d_X, \mu_X)$ embedded in a metric-measure space $(Y,d_Y,\mu_Y)$, given a finite set of points $S$ sampled from a uniform distrbution $\mu_X$ on $X$, possibly corrupted with noise from $Y$. We present the results of several computational experiments in the case that $X$ is embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where two of the three algorithms performed well.</description>

Abstract: We define an $\infty$-category $\mathrm{CycSyn}$ of $p$-typical cyclotomic synthetic spectra and prove that the motivic filtration on $\mathrm{THH}(R;\mathbf{Z}_p)$, defined by Bhatt, Morrow, and Scholze when $R$ is quasisyntomic and by Hahn, Raksit, and Wilson in the chromatically quasisyntomic case, naturally admits the structure of a $p$-typical cyclotomic synthetic spectrum. As a consequence, we obtain new bounds on the syntomic cohomology of connective chromatically quasisyntomic $\mathbf{E}_\infty$-ring spectra.</description>

      <title>Analysing Multiscale Clusterings with Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications in data clustering, it is desirable to find not just a single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions describing the data at different scales (or levels of coarseness). A natural problem then is to analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions that underpin multiscale descriptions of data. Here, we introduce the Multiscale Clustering Filtration (MCF), a well-defined and stable filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes arbitrary patterns of cluster assignments across scales of increasing coarseness. We show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures the degree of hierarchy in the sequence of partitions, and the higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we also provide an equivalent construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that in the hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an ultrametric space. We then use numerical experiments to illustrate how the MCF can serve to characterise multiscale clusterings of synthetic data from stochastic block models.</description>

Abstract: The space of degree d smooth projective hypersurfaces of CP n admits a scanning map to a certain space of sections. We compute a rational homotopy model of the action by conjugation of the group U (n + 1) on this space of sections, from which we deduce that the scanning map induces a monomorphism on cohomology when d &gt; 2. Our main technique is the rational homotopy theory of Sullivan and, more specifically, a Sullivan model for the action by conjugation of a connected topological group on a space of sections.</description>

      <title>Contraderived categories of CDG-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any CDG-ring $B^\bullet=(B^*,d,h)$, we show that the homotopy category of graded-projective (left) CDG-modules over $B^\bullet$ is equivalent to the quotient category of the homotopy of graded-flat CDG-modules by its full triangulated subcategory of flat CDG-modules. The contraderived category (in the sense of Becker) $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is the common name for these two triangulated categories. We also prove that the classes of cotorsion and graded-cotorsion CDG-modules coincide, and the contraderived category of CDG-modules is equivalent to the homotopy category of graded-flat graded-cotorsion CDG-modules. Assuming the graded ring $B^*$ to be graded right coherent, we show that the contraderived category $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is compactly generated and its full subcategory of compact objects is anti-equivalent to the full subcategory of compact objects in the coderived category of right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bco}}(\mathbf{Mod}{-}B^\bullet)$. Specifically, the latter triangulated category is the idempotent completion of the absolute derived category of finitely presented right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{abs}}(\mathbf{mod}{-}B^\bullet)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the standard comparison used by mathematicians between the idempotent complete pretriangulated dg-categories, over a unitary and commutative ring $k$, and the idempotent complete $k$-linear stable $\infty$-categories. Our approach is completely included in the $\infty$-categorical theory. To achieve the target we will reinterpret the Morita theory for dg-categories and we set the Morita theory for $k$-linear stable $\infty$-category.</description>
