      <title>Synchronization in Traffic Dynamics: Mechanisms of Hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a second-order linear differential equation, we analyze the dynamical mechanisms of no behavior pattern (pure response), reaction and anticipation behaviors in traffic. As an emergence of the underlying dynamical evolution, the periodic evolution trajectories (3D hysteresis) in phase space ($v_i, v_j, d_{ji}$) exhibit fascinating characters. We investigate the emerging Time-Delay ($TD$) phenomena and the resulting analytical hysteresis, an equal frequency sets of Lissajous figures. By quantifying energy dissipation through individual and system perspectives, we demonstrate that $TD$ and Time-To-Collision ($TTC$) are direct metrics of zero-dissipation under equilibrium and synchronization states. Finally, a phase diagram based on $TD$ and $TTC$ is developed to bridge the dynamical behaviors in traffic across $\mathbb{R}^1$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ spaces. Our results provide a theoretical foundation upon which many obscure mechanisms become self-evident, such as the $TD$-induced flip of the hysteresis (clockwise to counterclockwise in FD) and the crossed hysteresis, etc.</description>

      <title>Topological traps in evolutionary games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How cooperation originates and persists among self-interested individuals is a central question in the social and behavioural sciences. In the canonical two-dimensional spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with unconditional imitation introduced by Nowak and May (1992), simulations on a Moore lattice show an abrupt drop in cooperation near the temptation $T\approx5/3$, yet even under these harsh conditions cooperative structures can still arise. However, the nucleation rates of these motifs, and their contribution along the full cooperation curve had not been quantified. Here we show, using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations combined with automatic cluster classification, that on the Moore lattice for $T\ge5/3$ residual cooperation is sustained exclusively by $3\times3$ (or larger) rectangular cooperator bricks, whereas on degree-8 random-regular graphs for $T\gtrsim1.5$ it is dominated by star-like motifs (1 hub + 8 leaves). Once the dynamics becomes nucleation limited, the macroscopic cooperation level is therefore governed by the statistics of a few exceptionally resilient shapes, rather than by many different cooperator motifs. Furthermore, we show that the lattice cooperation collapse near $T=5/3$ is kinetic rather than critical: the reduction in cooperation is not due to a loss of growth capacity of rectangular bricks, but to the progressive destabilisation of the subcritical motifs that dominate just below this threshold. Our results show that residual cooperation at high temptation is a rare-event nucleation phenomenon governed by a small set of topological traps, and highlight the value of motif-level analysis for explaining and engineering cooperation in spatial, social, and technological networks.</description>

      <title>Evolving Networks Created by Preferential Attachment and Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing synthetic networks that follow power law distributions of a node's degree often involves adding one node at a time. Each node is added to the network with a fixed amount of edges and those edges are frozen for all future time steps. Yet real world networks often continuously evolve with edges being added and removed while new nodes are added to the network. Many existing growth models based on preferential attachment do not account for this evolutionary capability and when you extend their growth methods to add and remove edges to existing nodes the node degree distribution quickly loses its scale-free structure. This paper will go over a method to extend well known preferential attachment growth models to allow for the evolution of edges within a network while still maintaining a power law node degree distribution.</description>

      <title>Mesoamerican proportional design and astronomical dualities: rational approximations consistent with $\phi$ and $\pi$ in calendrics and architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how ancient Mesoamerican societies integrated mathematical ideas into calendrical design and monumental architecture requires approaches that acknowledge their distinct epistemological frameworks. While explicit textual evidence for concepts such as $\pi$ or the golden ratio $\phi$ is absent, numerical patterns embedded in Mesoamerican calendars, iconography, and ritual architecture reveal a coherent system of proportional reasoning grounded in simple integer ratios. Here we show that the numbers 5 and 8, central to Venus and solar calendrical relations and widely represented in Mesoamerican cosmology, generate rational approximations that reproduce, within known construction tolerances, the geometric relations associated with decagonal layouts. Using high-resolution measurements of the Iguana structure at Guachimontones, we demonstrate that its proportions align with integer ratios consistent with those found in the calendrical system and with the practical geometry of the regular decagon, without requiring knowledge of irrational constants. These findings suggest that Mesoamerican builders employed stable proportional modules that harmonized astronomical cycles, cosmological symbolism, and architectural design. This should not be interpreted as a lack of mathematical sophistication; rather, the material record reveals a distinct mathematical tradition in which number, measure, and cosmology were mutually reinforcing elements of cultural knowledge.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic Determinants of the COVID-19 Infodemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an infodemic of misinformation that impedes effective public health responses. This study examines relationships between socioeconomic factors and infodemic risk patterns across 37 OECD countries using Twitter data from 2020-2022. Employing dimensionality reduction techniques on 20 socioeconomic indicators, we identify complex correlations with infodemic measures that evolve throughout the pandemic. Countries exhibit distinct clustering in their infodemic profiles that transcend conventional socioeconomic categorizations. We find that dynamic information behaviors dominate initial crisis responses, while stable socioeconomic conditions become more influential as the pandemic progresses. News media diet diversity emerges as a significant protective factor, with pluralistic information ecosystems demonstrating greater resilience against misinformation. Additionally, institutional stability correlates strongly with reduced infodemic volatility over time. These findings highlight how infodemics are embedded within broader socioeconomic contexts, providing foundations for targeted interventions to build societal resilience against misinformation during future health emergencies.</description>

      <title>Competitive Social Mobilization in Threshold Models of Collective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social mobilization often fails not for a lack of collective interest, but because of fierce competition between rival movements for the same limited pool of participants. We generalize the classic threshold model of collective behavior to analyze this competitive aggregation, exploring how populations with diverse participation thresholds navigate multiple, mutually exclusive causes. Focusing on the conditions necessary for a single consensus movement to encompass an entire population, our analysis reveals that the outcome of social competition depends critically on the stability of individual dispositions. In quenched environments where participation thresholds are fixed, increasing resistance initially allows a dominant movement to suppress its competitors; however, further resistance triggers a sudden collapse into total fragmentation as low-threshold instigators become too rare to sustain growth. Conversely, in annealed environments where opinions are fluid, higher resistance paradoxically drives a winner-takes-all consensus. In this fluid scenario, massive movements can only be avoided through a deliberate divide-and-conquer strategy. In both cases, the transitions between pulverized and massive movements are discontinuous. These findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of social control depends entirely on environmental stability: raising the cost of participation can either forge unity or shatter collective action into insignificance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics of eco-evolutionary repeated games: Effect of reward and punishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term evolutionary processes can strongly influence common-pool resource conservation by generating new traits or behaviours that modify the feedback between population strategies and the resource state. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary framework in which individuals repeatedly interact with the same opponent and follow direct reciprocity through reactive strategies. The strategic dynamics is coupled to a renewable common resource and analyzed using adaptive dynamics. After our exhaustive non-linear dynamical analysis of $2\times2$ strategic games, we focus on comparative and combined usefulness of institutional incentives in the form of rewards and punishments in preventing the Tragedy of the Commons even when defection dominates in the replete resource state. We also report possibility of robust stable oscillations -- emerging via Hopf bifurcation -- in resource state and population strategies.</description>

      <title>Pregeometric Origins of Liquidity Geometry in Financial Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a structural framework for the geometry of financial order books in which liquidity, supply, and demand are treated as emergent observables rather than primitive economic variables. The market is modeled as an inflationary relational system without assumed metric, temporal, or price coordinates. Observable quantities arise only through projection, implemented here via spectral embeddings of the graph Laplacian. A one-dimensional projection induces a price-like coordinate, while the projected density defines liquidity profiles around the mid price. Under a minimal single-scale hypothesis -- excluding intrinsic length scales beyond distance to the mid and finite visibility -- we show that projected supply and demand are constrained to gamma-like functional forms. In discrete data, this prediction translates into integrated-gamma cumulative profiles. We test these results using high-frequency Level~II data for several U.S. equities and find robust agreement across assets and intraday windows. Explicit comparison with alternative cumulative models using information criteria demonstrates a systematic preference for the integrated-gamma geometry. A minimal simulation of inflationary relational dynamics reproduces the same structure without invoking agent behavior or price formation mechanisms. These results indicate that key regularities of order-book liquidity reflect geometric constraints induced by observation rather than detailed microstructural dynamics.

      <title>From microscopic social force models to macroscopic continuum models for pedestrian flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pedestrian flow is one of the most complex systems, involving large populations of interacting agents. Models at microscopic and macroscopic scales offer different advantages for studying related problems. In general, microscopic models can describe interaction forces at the individual level. Macroscopic models, on the other hand, provide analytical insights into global interactions and long-term overall dynamics, along with efficient numerical simulations and predictions. However, the relationship between models at different scales has rarely been explored. In this study, based on the original microscopic social force model with a reactive optimal route choice strategy, we first derive kinetic equations at the mesoscopic level. By varying the interaction force in different scenarios, we then derive several continuum models at the macroscopic level. Finally, numerical examples are given to evaluate the behaviors of the social force model and our continuum models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric Methane Removal (AMR) is a third class of climate intervention, along with Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management (SRM). We show that, unlike CDR, the avoided warming by AMR is not durable due to methane's short atmospheric lifetime, although its temperature rebound upon termination is less abrupt than that of SRM. AMR's unique impact on air quality (tropospheric ozone) can be further modulated by background pollutant levels.</description>

      <title>Unveiling hidden features of social evolution by inferring Langevin dynamics from data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Are there hidden dynamical common patterns in the evolution of social and cultural history? While the growing availability of digitized social data invites us to answer this question, prevailing quantitative methods often rely on deterministic snapshots or average effects. Such approaches overlook the continuous and inherently uncertain nature of historical trajectories. In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change.</description>

Abstract: Household adoption of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems is central to the green energy transition, yet diffusion depends on social influence and behavioral biases, as well as payback economics. This study develops a parsimonious Markovian model in which households move sequentially from being unengaged (Carbon) to informed, to planning, and finally to adoption (Green). Transition rates are micro-founded by two mechanisms: (i) social contagion/communication, proxied by the current share of adopters, and (ii) economic profitability, proxied by payback time computed from a Net Present Value framework. Novel to this diffusion setting, bounded rationality is introduced via hyperbolic discounting, creating a procrastination loop that delays adoption even when PV is economically attractive in a long-run perspective. Calibrated on the Italian residential PV diffusion path (2006-2020) and assessed in national and regional applications, the model reproduces observed trajectories and enables forward-looking scenario analysis (2020-2026). Results show that policies yielding similar payback improvements can produce different outcomes once present bias is accounted for and that behaviorally informed intervention are stronger. The findings contribute a micro-to-macro bridge between behavioral economics and technology diffusion modeling and imply that effective policy portfolios (and PV business models) should complement incentives with commitment devices and social-norm peer strategies to accelerate PV uptake and its spillover emissions benefits.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Optimization Approaches for the Network Immunization Problem with Quarantining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vaccination has played an important role in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. However, the limited availability of vaccines and personnel at the roll-out of a new vaccine and the costs of vaccination campaigns often limit how many people can be vaccinated. Network immunization thus focuses on selecting a fixed-size subset of individuals to vaccinate so as to minimize the disease spread. In this paper, we consider simulation-optimization approaches for this selection problem. Here, the simulation of disease spread in an activity-based contact graph allows us to consider the effect of contact tracing and a limited willingness to test and quarantine. First, we develop a stochastic programming heuristic based on sampling infection forests from the simulation. Second, we propose a genetic algorithm tailored to the immunization problem that combines simulation runs of different sizes to balance the time needed to find promising solutions with the uncertainty resulting from simulation. Both approaches are tested on data from a major university in Denmark and disease characteristics representing those of COVID-19. Our results show that the proposed methods are competitive with a large number of centrality-based measures over a range of disease parameters and that especially the stochastic programming heuristic can outperform them for a considerable number of these instances. Finally, we compare network immunization against our previously proposed approach of limiting distinct contacts. Although, independently, network immunization has a larger impact in reducing disease spread, we show that the combination of both methods reduces the disease spread even further.</description>

      <title>Cost Functions in Economic Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic complexity algorithms aim to uncover the hidden capabilities that drive economic systems. Here, we present a fundamental reinterpretation of two of these algorithms, the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and the Economic Fitness and Complexity (EFC), by reformulating them as optimization problems that minimize specific cost functions. We show that ECI computation is equivalent to finding eigenvectors of the network's transition matrix by minimizing the quadratic form associated with the network's Laplacian. For EFC, we derive a novel cost function that exploits the algorithm's intrinsic logarithmic structure and clarifies the role of the regularization parameter in its non-homogeneous version. Additionally, we establish the existence and uniqueness of its solution, providing theoretical foundations for its application. This optimization-based reformulation bridges economic complexity and established frameworks in spectral theory, network science, and optimization. The theoretical insights translate into practical computational advantages: we introduce a conservative, gradient-based update rule that substantially accelerates algorithmic convergence, with potential implications for a broader class of algorithms, including the Sinkhorn-Knopp method. Finally, we apply the energetic framework to a real-world trade network, demonstrating how link-wise energy provides a direct way to identify structurally relevant and vulnerable regions of the export matrix, thus complementing and enriching standard economic complexity analyses. Beyond advancing our theoretical understanding of economic complexity indicators, this work opens new pathways for algorithmic improvements and extends applicability to general network structures beyond traditional bipartite economic networks.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Cascade-Driven Assembly and Feasibility Transitions in Early Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can temporally supported functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient-a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling discriminative functional responses. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce finite-timescale structural and functional coherence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation. This connectivity-driven transition-functional percolation-requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and be temporarily supported, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>

      <title>Global population crisis scenarios predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple nonlinear differential equation (originally studied in the physics of disordered systems) is able to mathematically describe the global population growth over the past 12000 years. Different regimes of population growth since the early Neolithic until today are shown to be all solutions to the same nonlinear differential equation in its various limits. These also include the well-known Malthus (exponential) and Verhulst (logistic) growth regimes, as well as von Foerster's ``doomsday'' formula. All these limits correspond to neglecting higher-order terms in a more general nonlinear dynamic model described by the proposed nonlinear differential equation. While the older models may provide valid fittings to limited time intervals in the global population growth curve in time, their clearly approximate nature prevents them from being predictive over longer periods of time. The proposed comprehensive solution of the proposed model is instead well suited to provide predictions for future scenarios. These include halving of the global population as early as 2064 due to resource depletion, if the effect of the Earth's limited carrying capacity were to set in today.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered, which yields a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs near to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>
