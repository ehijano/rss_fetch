      <title>Measured inverse semigroups and their actions on von Neumann algebras and equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known to experts that certain regular inclusions of von Neumann algebras arise as crossed products with cocycle actions of the canonical quotient groupoids associated with the inclusions. Similarly, `strongly normal' inclusions of standard equivalence relations arise as semi-direct products with cocycle actions of the quotient groupoids. However, to the author's knowledge, rigorous proofs of these results in full generality are absent in the literature. In this article, we exploit the usual correspondence between inverse semigroups and groupoids, and give a unified approach to proving these `folklore' results and fill this gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>Monotone max-convolution and subordination functions for free max-convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the distribution of the spectral maximum of monotonically independent self-adjoint operators coincides with the classical max-convolution of their distributions. In free probability, it was proven that for any probability measures $\sigma,\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ there is a unique probability measure $\mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$ satisfying $\sigma\boxplus \mu = \sigma \triangleright \mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$, where $\boxplus$ and $\triangleright$ are free and monotone additive convolutions, respectively. We recall that the reciprocal Cauchy transform of $\mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$ is the subordination function for free additive convolution. Motivated by this analogy, we introduce subordination functions for free max-convolution and prove their existence and structural properties.</description>

      <title>New Properties and Refined Bounds for the $q$-Numerical Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates new properties of $q$-numerical ranges for compact normal operators and establishes refined upper bounds for the $q$-numerical radius of Hilbert space operators. We first prove that for a compact normal operator $T$ with $0 \in W_q(T)$, the $q$-numerical range $W_q(T)$ is a closed convex set containing the origin in its interior. We then explore the behavior of $q$-numerical ranges under complex symmetry, deriving inclusion relations between $W_q(T)$ and $W_q(T^*)$ for complex symmetric operators. For hyponormal operators similar to their adjoints, we provide conditions under which $T$ is self-adjoint and $W_q(T)$ is a real interval. We also study the continuity of $q$-numerical ranges under norm convergence and examine the effect of the Aluthge transform on $W_q(T)$. In the second part, we derive several new and sharp upper bounds for the $q$-numerical radius, incorporating the operator norm, numerical radius, transcendental radius, and the infimum of $\|Tx\|$ over the unit sphere. These bounds unify and improve upon existing results in the literature, offering a comprehensive framework for estimating $q$-numerical radii across the entire parameter range $q \in [0,1]$. Each result is illustrated with detailed examples and comparisons with prior work.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of outer automorphism groups of Thompson-like groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every Cuntz--Krieger groupoid, we show that there is a topologically free boundary action of the outer automorphism group of its topological full group on the Hilbert cube. In particular, these outer automorphism groups, including the outer automorphism groups of all Higman--Thompson groups, are C*-simple.</description>

      <title>Fischer's approach to deformation of coactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel approach to the deformation of $C^*$-algebras via coactions of locally compact groups, emphasizing Fischer's construction in the context of maximal coactions. We establish a rigorous framework for understanding how deformations arise from group coactions, extending previous work by Bhowmick, Neshveyev, and Sangha. Using Landstad duality, we compare different deformation procedures, demonstrating their equivalence and efficiency in constructing twisted versions of given $C^*$-algebras. Our results provide deeper insights into the interplay between exotic crossed products, coaction duality, and operator algebra deformations, offering a unified perspective for further generalizations.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Banach-bundle germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a continuous bundle $\mathcal{E}\to X$ of Banach/Hilbert spaces or Banach/$C^*$-algebras over a paracompact base space, equivariant for a compact Lie group $\mathbb{U}$ operating on all structures involved. We prove that in all cases homogeneous equivariant subbundles extend equivariantly from $\mathbb{U}$-invariant closed subsets of $X$ to closed invariant neighborhoods thereof (provided the fibers are semisimple in the Banach-algebra variant). This extends a number of results in the literature (due to Fell for non-equivariant local extensibility around a single point for $C^*$-algebras and the author for semisimple Banach algebras). The proofs are based in part on auxiliary results on (a) the extensibility of equivariant compact-Lie-group principal bundles locally around invariant closed subsets of paracompact spaces, as a consequence of equivariant-bundle classifying spaces being absolute neighborhood extensors in the relevant setting and (b) an equivariant-bundle version of Johnson's approximability of almost-multiplicative maps from finite-dimensional semisimple Banach algebras with Banach morphisms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Interlacing Families: New Error Bounds for CUR Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of generalized interlacing families of polynomials, which extends the classical interlacing polynomial method to handle polynomials of varying degrees. We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems.</description>
