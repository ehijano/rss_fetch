      <title>The Interdecadal Bipolar Oscillation: An Atmospheric Water Vapor Mode Driving Asynchronous Polar Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is progressing asynchronously between the Arctic and Antarctic, with important implications for global climate dynamics. While the Arctic has experienced rapid warming and pronounced amplification, the Antarctic has exhibited a delayed and heterogeneous response. Here, we identify an Interdecadal Bipolar Oscillation (IBO) in atmospheric water vapor, a coherent internal mode of variability that connects the two polar regions and helps explain their divergent climate trajectories over the past eight decades. Using reanalysis data alongside historical and pre-industrial control simulations from CMIP6, we demonstrate that the IBO is a robust internal variability mode with a quasi-period of 60 ~ 80 years. This oscillation modulates the background warming signal, with a phase shift in the late 1980s amplifying moistening and warming in the Arctic while concurrently suppressing changes in the Antarctic. Crucially, model projections suggest a possible phase reversal, which could slow water vapor increases in the Arctic while accelerating them in the Antarctic, potentially marking the start of rapid Antarctic climate change. While uncertainties remain in how climate models capture polar water vapor, our findings highlight the IBO as a pivotal driver of polar climate evolution and a potential contributor to emerging climate risks in the Southern Hemisphere.</description>

      <title>AI-boosted rare event sampling to characterize extreme weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weather extremes pose major societal risks, especially in a changing climate, but due to their rarity, they are difficult to study using limited observations or complex climate models. We introduce AI+RES, a framework coupling fast AI weather forecasts with a high-fidelity physics model using a rare-event algorithm to efficiently characterize extremes. This approach enables the study of the statistics and physics of very rare events, such as once per millennium heatwaves at two orders-of-magnitude lower computational cost. AI+RES can be applied broadly across climate science and other fields concerned with rare events.</description>

      <title>The Key Physics of Ice Premelting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</description>
