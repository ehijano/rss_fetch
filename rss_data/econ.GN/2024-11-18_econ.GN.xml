      <title>Natural resources balance sheets accounting: theoretical framework and practice in the Shaanxi province of China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve sustainable development, there is widespread of the need to protect natural resource and improve government oversight in achieving China's economic security and ecological civilization. Compilation of natural resources balance sheet (NRBS) and enhancement of resources management are becoming an important topic in China. How to compile NRBS to affix the responsibility for government and officials for inadequate supervision is still not resolved satisfactorily. This paper proposes the NRBS to enable governments to identify the importance of natural resource restoration and to hold leading cadres accountable for a lack of adequate supervision. The NRBS consist of three accounts: natural resource assets, natural resource liabilities, and net worth. Important components of the NRBS for the liabilities account with a property rights regime are developed to measure and assign responsibility. The compilation of an NRBS is applied to the Chinese province of Shaanxi as an illustration to demonstrate that the accounting framework and the compilation steps are tractable using financial methods and available data. The accounting results of natural resource assets and liabilities unveil the threat to resource management and the policy implications to government and officials. Finally, the advantages and limitations of NRBS are discussed.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Cost of Informal Care with a Novel Two-Stage Approach to Individual Synthetic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informal carers provide the majority of care for people living with challenges related to older age, long-term illness, or disability. However, the care they provide often results in a significant income penalty for carers, a factor largely overlooked in the economics literature and policy discourse. Leveraging data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, this paper provides the first robust causal estimates of the caring income penalty using a novel individual synthetic control based method that accounts for unit-level heterogeneity in post-treatment trajectories over time. Our baseline estimates identify an average relative income gap of up to 45%, with an average decrease of {\pounds}162 in monthly income, peaking at {\pounds}192 per month after 4 years, based on the difference between informal carers providing the highest-intensity of care and their synthetic counterparts. We find that the income penalty is more pronounced for women than for men, and varies by ethnicity and age.</description>

      <title>InvestESG: A multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark for studying climate investment as a social dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InvestESG is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark designed to study the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure mandates on corporate climate investments. Supported by both PyTorch and GPU-accelerated JAX framework, the benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment decisions. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in mitigation, even without investor involvement. Our findings align with empirical research using real-world data, highlighting MARL's potential to inform policy by providing insights into large-scale socio-economic challenges through efficient testing of alternative policy and market designs.</description>

      <title>The Link Between Large Scientific Collaboration and Productivity. Rethinking How to Estimate the Monetary Value of Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses how to assign a monetary value to scientific publications, particularly in the case of multi-author papers arising from large-scale research collaborations. Contemporary science increasingly relies on extensive and varied collaborations to tackle global challenges in fields such as life sciences, climate science, energy, high-energy physics, astronomy, and many others. We argue that existing literature fails to address the collaborative nature of research by overlooking the relationship between coauthorship and scientists productivity. Using the Marginal Cost of Production (MCP) approach, we first highlight the methodological limitations of ignoring this relationship, then propose a generalised MCP model to value co-authorship. As a case study, we examine High-Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, analysing approximately half a million scientific outputs by over 50,000 authors from 1990 to 2021. Our findings indicate that collaborative adjustments yield monetary valuations for subsets of highly collaborative papers up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than previous estimates, with elevated values correlating with high research quality. This study contributes to the literature on research output evaluation, addressing debates in science policy around assessing research performance and impact. Our methodology is applicable to authorship valuation both within academia and in large-scale scientific collaborations, fitting diverse research impact assessment frameworks or as self-standing procedure. Additionally, we discuss the conditions under which this method may complement survey-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Global evidence on the income elasticity of willingness to pay, relative price changes and public natural capital values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the global economy continues to grow, ecosystem services tend to stagnate or decline. Economic theory has shown how such shifts in relative scarcities can be reflected in project appraisal and accounting, but empirical evidence has been sparse to put theory into practice. To estimate relative price changes in ecosystem services to be used for making such adjustments, we perform a global meta-analysis of contingent valuation studies to derive income elasticities of marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for ecosystem services to proxy the degree of limited substitutability. Based on 735 income-WTP pairs from 396 studies, we find an income elasticity of WTP of around 0.6. Combined with good-specific growth rates, we estimate relative price change of ecosystem services of around 1.7 percent per year. In an application to natural capital valuation of forest ecosystem services by the World Bank, we show that natural capital should be uplifted by around 40 percent. Our assessment of aggregate public natural capital yields a larger value adjustment of between 58 and 97 percent, depending on the discount rate. We discuss implications for policy appraisal and for estimates of natural capital in comprehensive wealth accounts.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Usage and Exam Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the impact of students' usage of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT on their exam performance. We analyse student essays using GenAI detection systems to identify GenAI users among the cohort. Employing multivariate regression analysis, we find that students using GenAI tools score on average 6.71 (out of 100) points lower than non-users. While GenAI may offer benefits for learning and engagement, the way students actually use it correlates with diminished exam outcomes. Exploring the underlying mechanism, additional analyses show that the effect is particularly detrimental to students with high learning potential, suggesting an effect whereby GenAI tool usage hinders learning. Our findings provide important empirical evidence for the ongoing debate on the integration of GenAI in higher education and underscores the necessity for educators, institutions, and policymakers to carefully consider its implications for student performance.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Occupational Mobility in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an era of rapid technological advancements and macroeconomic shifts, worker reallocation is necessary, yet responses to labor market shocks remain sluggish, making it crucial to identify bottlenecks in occupational transitions to understand labor market dynamics and improve mobility. In this study, we analyze French occupational data to uncover patterns of worker mobility and pinpoint specific occupations that act as bottlenecks which impede rapid reallocation. We introduce two metrics, transferability and accessibility, to quantify the diversity of occupational transitions and find that bottlenecks can be explained by a condensation effect of occupations with high accessibility but low transferability. Transferability measures the variety of transitions from an occupation to others, while accessibility assesses the variety of transitions into an occupation. We provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing occupational complexity and mobility patterns, offering insights into potential barriers and pathways for efficient retraining programs. We argue that our approach can inform policymakers and stakeholders aiming to enhance labor market efficiency and support workforce adaptability.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic characterizations of some simple risk-sharing rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present axiomatic characterizations of some simple risk-sharing (RS) rules, such as the uniform, the mean-proportional and the covariance-based linear RS rules. These characterizations make it easier to understand the underlying principles when applying these rules. Such principles typically include maintaining some degree of anonymity regarding participants' data and/or incident-specific data, adopting non-punitive processes and ensuring the equitability and fairness of risk sharing. By formalizing key concepts such as the reshuffling property, the source-anonymous contributions property and the strongly aggregate contributions property, along with their generalizations, we develop a comprehensive framework that expresses these principles clearly and defines the relevant rules. To illustrate, we demonstrate that the uniform RS rule, a simple mechanism in which risks are shared equally, is the only RS rule that satisfies both the reshuffling property and the source-anonymous contributions property. This straightforward axiomatic characterization of the uniform RS rule serves as a foundation for exploring similar principles in two broad classes of risk-sharing rules, which we baptize the $q$-proportional RS rules and the $(q_1,q_2)$-based linear RS rules, respectively. This framework also allows us to introduce novel particular RS rules, such as the scenario-based RS rules.</description>
