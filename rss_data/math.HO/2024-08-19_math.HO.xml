      <title>Mathematics of Family Planning in Talmud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the commitments from the Talmud in Judaism, we consider the family planning rules which require a couple to get children till certain numbers of boys and girls are reached. For example, the rabbinical school of Beit Hillel says that one boy and one girl are necessary, whereas Beit Shammai urges for two boys. Surprisingly enough, although the corresponding average family sizes differ in both cases, the gender ratios remain constant. We show more that for any family planning rule the gender ratio is equal to the birth odds. The proof of this result is given by using different mathematical techniques, such as induction principle, Doob's optional-stopping theorem, and brute-force. We conclude that, despite possible asymmetries in the religiously motivated family planning rules, they discriminate neither boys nor girls.</description>

      <title>Max/Min Puzzles in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02050v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective here is to find the maximum polygon, in area, which can be enclosed in a given triangle, for the polygons: parallelograms, rectangles and squares. It will initially be assumed that the choices are inscribed polygons, that is all vertices of the polygon are on the sides of the triangle. This concept will be generalized later to include wedged polygons.</description>

      <title>Very basic set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ernst Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory (1908) did not exclude `a set that is a member of itself'. We call a set that is a member of itself `an individual'. In this article we prove the elimination of Russell's paradox is equivalent to "For every set S, an individual is a member of S or a set (but not an individual) is not a member of S". This shows there is place is set theory for individuals. We give individuals the place they deserve according to formal logic.</description>
