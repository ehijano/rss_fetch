      <title>Sub-Riemannian Geometry, Mixing, and the Holonomy of Optimal Mass Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) has in recent years spurred a fast developing phase of research in stochastic control, control of ensemble systems, thermodynamics, data science, and several other fields in engineering and science. Specifically, OMT endowed the space of probability distributions with a rich Riemannian-like geometry, the Wasserstein geometry and the Wasserstein $\mathcal W_2$-metric. This geometry proved fruitful in quantifying and regulating the uncertainty of deterministic and stochastic systems, and in dealing with problems related to the transport of ensembles in continuous and discrete spaces.
  We herein introduce a new type of transportation problems. The salient feature of these problems is that particles/agents in the ensemble, that are to be transported, are labeled and their relative position along their journey is of interest. Of particular importance in our program are closed orbits where particles return to their original place after being transported along closed paths. Thereby, control laws are sought so that the distribution of the ensemble traverses a closed orbit in the Wasserstein manifold without mixing. This feature is in contrast with the classical theory of optimal transport where the primary object of study is the path of probability densities, without any concern about mixing of the flow, which is expected and allowed when traversing curves in the Wasserstein space.
  In the theory that we present, we explore a hitherto unstudied sub-Riemannian structure of Monge-Kantorovich transport where the relative position of particles along their journey is modeled by the holonomy of the transportation schedule. From this vantage point, we discuss several other problems of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Charge-Discharge Coupling Strategy for Dispatching Problems with Electric Tractors at Airports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airports worldwide are actively promoting the transition of ground service vehicles from traditional fuel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. The key to the successful implementation of this transition lies in the development of efficient electric vehicle dispatching models that comprehensively consider the charge-discharge processes of electric vehicles. However, due to the nonlinear characteristics of charge-discharge processes, finding precise solutions poses a significant challenge. Previous researchers have often used traditional energy consumption models and constant charging rates to simplify calculations, but this has resulted in inaccurate estimates of the remaining battery charge level. Furthermore, the lack of diverse pacing and charging strategies for airport ground service vehicles necessitates more adaptable solutions to enhance operational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper uses airport electric tractors as a case study, develops an accurate model that takes into account the start-stop process and a piecewise linear charging function, designs an improved genetic algorithm that incorporates a greedy algorithm and an adaptive strategy, and develops charge-discharge coupling strategies for different configuration scenarios at Nanjing Lukou Airport to meet current and future needs. The research results indicate that compared to traditional genetic algorithms, the proposed improved genetic algorithm significantly enhances solution accuracy and convergence speed. Additionally, with the increase in flight scale, airports can appropriately enhance their charging strategies; airports with dispersed aircraft stands should devise higher pacing strategies compared to those with dense aircraft stands.</description>

      <title>Optimization model for electric aircraft tow tractors considering operator coalition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizontal collaboration between operators can save traffic operation costs, a concept that has been particularly validated in the logistics field. Due to the increasing transportation demand and the introduction of charging times for electric vehicles, there is growing pressure on airport ground support services. This study introduces the concept of coalition to airport ground support services. Unlike most studies on horizontal collaboration, the scheduling for airport ground support services needs to particularly consider punctuality issues. In this study, we separately establish electric vehicle scheduling models for operator-separate and operator-cooperated modes and design an algorithm based on the concept of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm, aiming to obtain the electric vehicle scheduling plan with minimum cost and delay time. Furthermore, the study proposes a cost allocation method that considers the degree of sharing among operators to ensure the feasibility of coalition. Finally, we conducted numerical experiments based on actual airport operation data. The experiments verified the effectiveness of the algorithm and the cost allocation method. Compared to solvers, our algorithm can obtain feasible solutions in a shorter time while ensuring that the objective function gap is within 2%. Additionally, the improved cost allocation method is fairer compared to the traditional Shapley method. Numerical experiments also show that coalition can save 15-25% of airport operating costs and 26-39% of delay time, with savings varying based on the sharing parameters. Through quantitative analysis such as sensitivity analysis, the study provides insights into the variation patterns of overall and individual shared utilities and offers suggestions and decision-making mechanisms for the configuration and operation of airport ground operators.</description>

      <title>Integrated Bundling and Pricing of Unique Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retailers have significant potential to improve recommendations through strategic bundling and pricing. By taking into account different types of customers and their purchasing decisions, retailers can better accommodate customer preferences and increase revenues while reducing unsold items. We consider a retailer seeking to maximize its expected revenue by selling unique and non-replenishable items over a finite horizon. The retailer may offer each item individually or as part of a bundle.
  Our approach provides tractable bounds on expected revenue that are tailored to unique items and suitable for a rich class of choice models. We leverage these bounds to propose a bundling algorithm that efficiently selects bundles in a column-generation fashion. Under the multinomial logit model, our bounds are asymptotically optimal as the expected number of arrivals $\lambda$ grows, yielding a performance bound in $O(1/\lambda)$. In contrast, we show that both the static and fluid approximations are not asymptotically optimal. Moreover, we propose a greedy algorithm that allows for tractable dynamic bundling.
  We show through numerical experiments that third-party logistics providers (3PL) in particular can benefit from improved load recommendations and pricing decisions. By not only minimizing shipping costs, but also reducing empty miles and suggesting options that better match carrier preferences, our methodology benefits digital brokerage platforms while contributing to the transportation industry's sustainability efforts. In a Texas Triangle simulation powered by Uber Freight data, dynamic bundling and pricing reduces costs by 6%, empty miles by 25%, and more than halves the number of unmatched loads over dynamic pricing alone.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Proximal Lagrangian Method for Nonlinear Constrained Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a smoothed proximal Lagrangian method for minimizing a nonconvex smooth function over a convex domain with additional explicit convex nonlinear constraints. Two key features are 1) the proposed method is single-looped, and 2) an first-order iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is established under mild regularity assumptions. The first feature suggests the practical efficiency of the proposed method, while the second feature highlights its theoretical superiority. Numerical experiments on various problem scales demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of speed and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Blackbox optimization for origami-inspired bistable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistable mechanical systems exhibit two stable configurations where the elastic energy is locally minimized. To realize such systems, origami techniques have been proposed as a versatile platform to design deployable structures with both compact and functional stable states. Conceptually, a bistable origami motif is composed of two-dimensional surfaces connected by one-dimensional fold lines. This leads to stable configurations exhibiting zero-energy local minima. Physically, origami-inspired structures are three-dimensional, comprising facets and hinges fabricated in a distinct stable state where residual stresses are minimized. This leads to the dominance of one stable state over the other. To improve mechanical performance, one can solve the constrained optimization problem of maximizing the bistability of origami structures, defined as the amount of elastic energy required to switch between stable states, while ensuring materials used for the facets and hinges remain within their elastic regime. In this study, the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm, a blackbox optimization technique, is used to solve the constrained optimization problem. The bistable waterbomb-base origami motif is selected as a case-study to present the methodology. The elastic energy of this origami pattern under deployment is calculated via Finite Element simulations which serve as the blackbox in the MADS optimization loop. To validate the results, optimized waterbomb-base geometries are built via Fused Filament Fabrication and their response under loading is characterized experimentally on a Uniaxial Test Machine. Ultimately, our method offers a general framework for optimizing bistability in mechanical systems, presenting opportunities for advancement across various engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Approximate controllability for 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate controllability of the Euler equations is investigated by means of a finite set of actuators. It is proven that approximate controllability holds if we can find a saturating subset of actuators. The notion of saturating set is relaxed when compared to previous literature, so that a weaker sufficient condition for approximate controllability is provided. The result holds for general bounded two-dimensional spatial domains with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>Data-driven distributionally robust MPC for systems with multiplicative noise: A semi-infinite semi-definite programming approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel distributionally robust model predictive control (DRMPC) algorithm for a specific class of controlled dynamical systems where the disturbance multiplies the state and control variables. These classes of systems arise in mathematical finance, where the paradigm of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) fits perfectly, and this serves as the primary motivation for this work. We recast the optimal control problem (OCP) as a semi-definite program with an infinite number of constraints, making the ensuing optimization problem a \emph{semi-infinite semi-definite program} (SI-SDP). To numerically solve the SI-SDP, we advance an approach for solving convex semi-infinite programs (SIPs) to SI-SDPs and, subsequently, solve the DRMPC problem. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for T-S Fuzzy Markovian Jump Systems Using Dynamic Prediction Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the model predictive control (MPC) problem is investigated for the constrained discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy Markovian jump systems (FMJSs) under imperfect premise matching rules. To strike a balance between initial feasible region, control performance, and online computation burden, a set of mode-dependent state feedback fuzzy controllers within the frame of dynamic prediction optimizing (DPO)-MPC is delicately designed with the perturbation variables produced by the predictive dynamics. The DPO-MPC controllers are implemented via two stages: at the first stage, terminal constraints sets companied with feedback gain are obtained by solving a ``min-max'' problem; at the second stage, and a set of perturbations is designed felicitously to enlarge the feasible region. Here, dynamic feedback gains are designed for off-line using matrix factorization technique, while the dynamic controller state is determined for online over a moving horizon to gradually guide the system state from the initial feasible region to the terminal constraint set. Sufficient conditions are provided to rigorously ensure the recursive feasibility of the proposed DPO-MPC scheme and the mean-square stability of the underlying FMJS. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated through a robot arm system example.</description>

      <title>Robo-GS: A Physics Consistent Spatial-Temporal Model for Robotic Arm with Hybrid Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real2Sim2Real plays a critical role in robotic arm control and reinforcement learning, yet bridging this gap remains a significant challenge due to the complex physical properties of robots and the objects they manipulate. Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with spatial representations and their associated physics attributes.
  We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms.
  This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods.

      <description>arXiv:2408.14926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider effective discretization strategies and iterative solvers for nonlinear PDE-constrained optimization models for pattern evolution within biological processes. Upon a Sequential Quadratic Programming linearization of the optimization problem, we devise appropriate time-stepping schemes and discrete approximations of the cost functionals such that the discretization and optimization operations are commutative, a highly desirable property of a discretization of such problems. We formulate the large-scale, coupled linear systems in such a way that efficient preconditioned iterative methods can be applied within a Krylov subspace solver. Numerical experiments demonstrate the viability and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound is an essential sensing element for many organisms in nature, and multiple species have evolved organic structures that create complex acoustic scattering and dispersion phenomena to emit and perceive sound unambiguously. To date, it has not proven possible to design artificial scattering structures that rival the performance of those found in organic structures. Contrarily, most sound manipulation relies on active transduction in fluid media rather than relying on passive scattering principles, as are often found in nature. In this work, we utilize computational morphogenesis to synthesize complex energy-efficient wavelength-sized single-material scattering structures that passively decompose radiated sound into its spatio-spectral components. Specifically, we tailor an acoustic rainbow structure with "above unity" efficiency and an acoustic wavelength-splitter. Our work paves the way for a new frontier in sound-field engineering, with potential applications in transduction, bionics, energy harvesting, communications and sensing.</description>

      <title>Constrained Diffusion Models via Dual Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have attained prominence for their ability to synthesize a probability distribution for a given dataset via a diffusion process, enabling the generation of new data points with high fidelity. However, diffusion processes are prone to generating biased data based on the training dataset. To address this issue, we develop constrained diffusion models by imposing diffusion constraints based on desired distributions that are informed by requirements. Specifically, we cast the training of diffusion models under requirements as a constrained distribution optimization problem that aims to reduce the distribution difference between original and generated data while obeying constraints on the distribution of generated data. We show that our constrained diffusion models generate new data from a mixture data distribution that achieves the optimal trade-off among objective and constraints. To train constrained diffusion models, we develop a dual training algorithm and characterize the optimality of the trained constrained diffusion model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our constrained models in two constrained generation tasks: (i) we consider a dataset with one or more underrepresented classes where we train the model with constraints to ensure fairly sampling from all classes during inference; (ii) we fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model to sample from a new dataset while avoiding overfitting.</description>

      <title>On some minimal characteristics in a model of a system of N particles with interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the well-known model of a system of N particles with interaction (N-body problem), we consider the spatial problem of finding the minimum of the function of the kinetic energy of a system on its phase space under conditions on its size and angular momentum. Based on the solution to this problem, we prove that the minimum possible kinetic energy of a system at the current value of its size can be achieved only on flat trajectories of the system. And under some natural additional conditions these trajectories are flat finite and periodic (elliptical) trajectories generated by flat central configurations. The solution to this problem also provides a simpler solution to a similar optimization dual problem of finding the minimum of the size of a system under conditions on its kinetic energy and angular momentum. This leads to a similar result that the minimum possible size of the system at the current value of its kinetic energy can also be achieved only on flat trajectories. Under some additional conditions these trajectories are also flat periodic elliptical trajectories generated by flat central configurations. Next, we consider the more complex spatial problem of finding local minima of the function of the kinetic energy of a system on its phase space at fixed values of the integrals of motion: angular momentum and total energy of a system. Based on the solution of this problem, we prove further that under some natural additional conditions the local minima of the system kinetic and potential energy functions at fixed values of these integrals of motion can be achieved only on flat periodic elliptical trajectories generated by some flat central configurations. And at the points of these local minima the minimum possible kinetic energy of the system at the current value of its size and the minimum possible size of the system at the current value of its kinetic energy are also achieved.</description>

Abstract: Mean-field games (MFG) have become significant tools for solving large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning problems under symmetry. However, the assumption of exact symmetry limits the applicability of MFGs, as real-world scenarios often feature inherent heterogeneity. Furthermore, most works on MFG assume access to a known MFG model, which might not be readily available for real-world finite-agent games. In this work, we broaden the applicability of MFGs by providing a methodology to extend any finite-player, possibly asymmetric, game to an "induced MFG". First, we prove that $N$-player dynamic games can be symmetrized and smoothly extended to the infinite-player continuum via explicit Kirszbraun extensions. Next, we propose the notion of $\alpha,\beta$-symmetric games, a new class of dynamic population games that incorporate approximate permutation invariance. For $\alpha,\beta$-symmetric games, we establish explicit approximation bounds, demonstrating that a Nash policy of the induced MFG is an approximate Nash of the $N$-player dynamic game. We show that TD learning converges up to a small bias using trajectories of the $N$-player game with finite-sample guarantees, permitting symmetrized learning without building an explicit MFG model. Finally, for certain games satisfying monotonicity, we prove a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-6})$ for the $N$-agent game to learn an $\varepsilon$-Nash up to symmetrization bias. Our theory is supported by evaluations on MARL benchmarks with thousands of agents.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium transport with time-inconsistent costs: An application to matching problems in the job market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01498v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two probability measures on sequential data, we investigate the transport problem with time-inconsistent preferences in a discrete-time setting. Motivating examples are nonlinear objectives, state-dependent costs, and regularized optimal transport with general $f$-divergence. Under the bicausal constraint, we introduce the concept of equilibrium transport. Existence is proved in the semi-discrete Markovian case and the continuous non-Markovian case with strict quasiconvexity, while uniqueness also holds in the second case. We apply our framework to study inertia of two job markets, top-ranking executives and academia. The empirical analysis shows that a job market with stronger inertia is less efficient. The University of California (UC) postdoc job market has the strongest inertia even than that of executives, while there is no evidence of inertia in the UC faculty job market.</description>

      <title>Modified parameter of Dai Liao conjugacy condition of the conjugate gradient method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conjugate gradient (CG) method is widely used for solving nonlinear unconstrained optimization problems because it requires less memory to implement. In this paper, we propose a new parameter of the Dai Liao conjugacy condition of the CG method with the restart property, which depends on the Lipschitz constant and is related to the Hestenes Stiefel method. The proposed method satisfies the descent condition and global convergence properties for convex and non-convex functions. In the numerical experiment, we compare the new method with CG_Descent using more than 200 functions from the CUTEst library. The comparison results show that the new method outperforms CG Descent in terms of CPU time, number of iterations, number of gradient evaluations, and number of function evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mathematical model of an orbiting satellite, comprising a rigid carrier body and a flexible boom, operating under the influence of gravity gradient torque. This model is represented by a nonlinear control system, which includes ordinary differential equations governing the carrier body's angular velocity and attitude quaternion, coupled with the Euler-Bernoulli equations that describe the vibration of the flexible component. We propose an explicit feedback design aimed at guaranteeing the partial stability of the closed-loop system in an appropriate Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Viscosity Solutions of a class of Second Order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to solving a class of second order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in the Wasserstein space, associated with mean field control problems involving common noise. The well-posedness of viscosity solutions to the HJB equation under a new notion is established under general assumptions on the coefficients. Our approach adopts the smooth metric developed by Bayraktar, Ekren, and Zhang [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. (2023)] as our gauge function for the purpose of smooth variational principle used in the proof of comparison theorem. Further estimates and regularity of the metric, including a novel second order derivative estimate with respect to the measure variable, are derived in order to ensure the uniqueness and existence.</description>

      <title>Bregman Proximal Linearized ADMM for Minimizing Separable Sums Coupled by a Difference of Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a splitting algorithm incorporating Bregman distances to solve a broad class of linearly constrained composite optimization problems, whose objective function is the separable sum of possibly nonconvex nonsmooth functions and a smooth function, coupled by a difference of functions. This structure encapsulates numerous significant nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems in the current literature including the linearly constrained difference-of-convex problems. Relying on the successive linearization and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the proposed algorithm exhibits the global subsequential convergence to a stationary point of the underlying problem. We also establish the convergence of the full sequence generated by our algorithm under the Kurdyka--Lojasiewicz property and some mild assumptions. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is tested on a robust principal component analysis problem and a nonconvex optimal power flow problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reflection Coefficients for ASK Modulated Backscattering from Passive Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies backscatter communication (BackCom) systems with a passive backscatter tag. The effectiveness of these tags is limited by the amount of energy they can harness from incident radio signals, which are used to backscatter information through the modulation of reflections. To address this limitation, we adopt a practical Constant-Linear-Constant (CLC) energy harvesting model that accounts for the harvester's sensitivity and saturation threshold, both of which depend on the input power. This paper aims to maximize this harvested power at a passive tag by optimally designing the underlying M-ary amplitude-shift keying (ASK) modulator in a monostatic BackCom system. Specifically, we derive the closed-form expression for the global optimal reflection coefficients that maximize the tag's harvested power while satisfying the minimum symbol error rate (SER) requirement, tag sensitivity, and reader sensitivity constraints. We also proposed optimal binary-ASK modulation design to gain novel design insights on practical BackCom systems with readers having superior sensitivity. We have validated these nontrivial analytical claims via extensive simulations. The numerical results provide insight into the impact of the transmit symbol probability, tag sensitivity constraint, and SER on the maximum average harvested power. Remarkably, our design achieves an overall gain of around 13% over the benchmark, signifying its utility in improving the efficiency of BackCom systems. Moreover, our proposed solution methodology for determining the maximum average harvested power is applicable to any type of energy harvesting model that exhibits a monotonic increasing relationship with the input power.</description>

      <title>A Derivative-Free Martingale Neural Network Soc-Martnet For The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations In Stochastic Optimal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient derivative-free version of a martingale neural network SOC-MartNet proposed in Cai et al. [2] for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs) with controls on both drift and volatility. The solution of the HJB equation consists of two steps: (1) finding the optimal control from the value function, and (2) deriving the value function from a linear PDE characterized by the optimal control. The linear PDE is reformulated into a weak form of a new martingale formulation from the original SOC-MartNet where all temporal and spatial derivatives are replaced by an univariate, first-order random finite difference operator approximation, giving the derivative free version of the SOC-MartNet. Then, the optimal feedback control is identified by minimizing the mean of the value function, thereby avoiding the need for pointwise minimization on the Hamiltonian. Finally, the optimal control and value function are approximated by neural networks trained via adversarial learning using the derivative-free formulation. This method eliminates the reliance on automatic differentiation for computing temporal and spatial derivatives, offering significant efficiency in solving high-dimensional HJB equations and SOCPs.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the restriction of a polynomial to a sphere satisfies a Logvinenko-Sereda-Kovrijkine type inequality
  (a specific type of uncertainty relation).
  This implies a spectral inequality for the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which, in turn, yields
  observability and null-controllability with explicit estimates on the control costs for the spherical heat equation that
  are sharp in the large and in the small time regime.</description>

Abstract: We review state-of-the-art optimality conditions of multivariate Chebyshev approximation, including, from oldest to newest, Kirchberger's kernel condition, Kolmogorov criteria, Rivlin and Shapiro's annihilating measures. These conditions are then re-interpreted using the optimality conditions of convex optimization, subdifferential and directional derivative. Finally, this new point of view is used to derive new optimality conditions for the following problems: First for the multivariate Chebyshev approximation with a weight function. Second, the approximation problem proposed by Arzelier, Br ehard and Joldes (26th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic 2019) consisting in minimizing the sum of both the polynomial approximation error and the first order approximation of the worst case evaluation error of the polynomial in Horner form.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of a discretization of dynamic optimal transport using the dual formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a discretization of the dynamic optimal transport problem for which we can obtain the convergence rate for the value of the transport cost to its continuous value when the temporal and spatial stepsize vanish. This convergence result does not require any regularity assumption on the measures, though experiments suggest that the rate is not sharp. Via an analysis of the duality gap we also obtain the convergence rates for the gradient of the optimal potentials and the velocity field under mild regularity assumptions. To obtain such rates, we discretize the dual formulation of the dynamic optimal transport problem and use the mature literature related to the error due to discretizing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper first proposes the Halfway Escape Optimization (HEO) algorithm, a quantum-inspired metaheuristic designed to address general optimization problems characterized by rugged landscapes and high-dimensionality with an efficient convergence rate. The study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of HEO's performance against established optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The primary analysis encompasses 14 benchmark functions with dimension 30, demonstrating HEO's effectiveness and adaptability in navigating general optimization landscapes and providing valuable insights into its performance. The test of HEO in Pressure Vessel Design and Tubular Column Design infers its feasibility and potential in real-time applications. Further validation in Osmancik-97 and Cammeo Rice Classification proves the effectiveness of HEO and achieves a higher accuracy record.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying breakpoints in piecewise regression is critical in enhancing the reliability and interpretability of data fitting. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms based on the greedy algorithm to accurately and efficiently identify breakpoints in piecewise polynomial regression. The algorithm updates the breakpoints to minimize the error by exploring the neighborhood of each breakpoint. It has a fast convergence rate and stability to find optimal breakpoints. Moreover, it can determine the optimal number of breakpoints. The computational results for real and synthetic data show that its accuracy is better than any existing methods. The real-world datasets demonstrate that breakpoints through the proposed algorithm provide valuable data information.</description>
