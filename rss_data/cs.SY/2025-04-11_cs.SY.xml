      <title>Multi-Agent Trustworthy Consensus under Random Dynamic Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the consensus problem in which legitimate agents send their values over an undirected communication network in the presence of an unknown subset of malicious or faulty agents. In contrast to former works, we generalize and characterize the properties of consensus dynamics with dependent sequences of malicious transmissions with dynamic (time-varying) rates, based on not necessarily independent trust observations. We consider a detection algorithm utilizing stochastic trust observations available to legitimate agents. Under these conditions, legitimate agents almost surely classify their neighbors and form their trusted neighborhoods correctly with decaying misclassification probabilities. We further prove that the consensus process converges almost surely despite the existence of malicious agents. For a given value of failure probability, we characterize the deviation from the nominal consensus value ideally occurring when there are no malicious agents in the system. We also examine the convergence rate of the process in finite time. Numerical simulations show the convergence among agents and indicate the deviation under different attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>Compositional design for time-varying and nonlinear coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the design of multi-agent coordination through high-order consensus protocols. While first-order consensus strategies are well-studied -- with known robustness to uncertainties such as time delays, time-varying weights, and nonlinearities like saturations -- the theoretical guarantees for high-order consensus are comparatively limited. We propose a compositional control framework that generates high-order consensus protocols by serially connecting stable first-order consensus operators. Under mild assumptions, we establish that the resulting high-order system inherits stability properties from its components. The proposed design is versatile and supports a wide range of real-world constraints. This is demonstrated through applications inspired by vehicular formation control, including protocols with time-varying weights, bounded time-varying delays, and saturated inputs. We derive theoretical guarantees for these settings using the proposed compositional approach and demonstrate the advantages gained compared to conventional protocols in simulations.</description>

      <title>Can Carbon-Aware Electric Load Shifting Reduce Emissions? An Equilibrium-Based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of electric loads, such as hydrogen producers or data centers, can be characterized as carbon-sensitive, meaning that they are willing to adapt the timing and/or location of their electricity usage in order to minimize carbon footprints. However, the emission reduction efforts of these carbon-sensitive loads rely on carbon intensity information such as average carbon emissions, and it is unclear whether load shifting based on these signals effectively reduces carbon emissions. To address this open question, we investigate the impact of carbon-sensitive consumers using equilibrium analysis. Specifically, we expand the commonly used equilibrium model for electricity market clearing to include carbon-sensitive consumers that adapt their consumption based on an average carbon intensity signal. This analysis represents an idealized situation for carbon-sensitive loads, where their carbon preferences are reflected directly in the market clearing, and contrasts with current practice where carbon intensity signals only become known to consumers aposteriori (i.e. after the market has already been cleared). We include both illustrative examples and larger numerical simulations, including benchmarking with other methods, to illuminate the contributions and limitations of carbon-sensitive loads in power system emission reductions.</description>

      <title>Personalized and Demand-Based Education Concept: Practical Tools for Control Engineers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a personalized lecture concept using educational blocks and its demonstrative application in a new university lecture. Higher education faces daily challenges: deep and specialized knowledge is available from everywhere and accessible to almost everyone. University lecturers of specialized master courses confront the problem that their lectures are either too boring or too complex for the attending students. Additionally, curricula are changing more rapidly than they have in the past 10-30 years. The German education system comprises different educational forms, with universities providing less practical content. Consequently, many university students do not obtain the practical skills they should ideally gain through university lectures. Therefore, in this work, a new lecture concept is proposed based on the extension of the just-in-time teaching paradigm: Personalized and Demand-Based Education. This concept includes: 1) an initial assessment of students' backgrounds, 2) selecting the appropriate educational blocks, and 3) collecting ongoing feedback during the semester. The feedback was gathered via Pingo, ensuring anonymity for the students. Our concept was exemplarily tested in the new lecture "Practical Tools for Control Engineers" at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The initial results indicate that our proposed concept could be beneficial in addressing the current challenges in higher education.</description>

      <title>Modular Control of Discrete Event System for Modeling and Mitigating Power System Cascading Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascading failures in power systems caused by sequential tripping of components are a serious concern as they can lead to complete or partial shutdowns, disrupting vital services and causing damage and inconvenience. In prior work, we developed a new approach for identifying and preventing cascading failures in power systems. The approach uses supervisory control technique of discrete event systems (DES) by incorporating both on-line lookahead control and forcible events. In this paper, we use modular supervisory control of DES to reduce computation complexity and increase the robustness and reliability of control. Modular supervisory control allows us to predict and mitigate cascading failures in power systems more effectively. We implemented the proposed control technique on a simulation platform developed in MATLAB and applied the proposed DES controller. The calculations of modular supervisory control of DES are performed using an external tool and imported into the MATLAB platform. We conduct simulation studies for the IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus and 300-bus systems, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Strategic learning for disturbance rejection in multi-agent systems: Nash and Minmax in graphical games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the optimal control problem with disturbance rejection for discrete-time multi-agent systems under cooperative and non-cooperative graphical games frameworks. Given the practical challenges of obtaining accurate models, Q-function-based policy iteration methods are proposed to seek the Nash equilibrium solution for the cooperative graphical game and the distributed minmax solution for the non-cooperative graphical game. To implement these methods online, two reinforcement learning frameworks are developed, an actor-disturber-critic structure for the cooperative graphical game and an actor-adversary-disturber-critic structure for the non-cooperative graphical game. The stability of the proposed methods is rigorously analyzed, and simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of decoupling feeding networks for antenna arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field and radiation coupling between nearby radiating elements is unavoidable, and it is considered a limiting factor for applications in wireless communications and active sensing. This article proposes a density-based topology optimization approach to design decoupling networks for such systems. The decoupling networks are designed based on a multi-objective optimization problem with the radiating elements replaced by their time-domain impulse response for efficient computations and to enable the solution of the design problem using gradient-based optimization methods. We use the adjoint-field method to compute the gradients of the optimization objectives. Additionally, nonlinear filters are applied during the optimization procedure to impose minimum-size control on the optimized designs. We demonstrate the concept by designing the decoupling network for a two-element planar antenna array; the antenna is designed in a separate optimization problem. The optimized decoupling networks provide a signal path that destructively interferes with the coupling between the radiating elements while preserving their individual matching to the feeding ports. Compact decoupling networks capable of suppressing the mutual coupling by more than 10 dB between two closely separated planar antennas operating around 2.45 GHz are presented and validated experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of controlling collective behavior in complex systems comprising large ensembles of interacting dynamical agents. Building upon traditional control theory's foundation in individual systems, we introduce tools designed to address the unique challenges of coordinating networks that exhibit emergent phenomena, including consensus, synchronization, and pattern formation. We analyze how local agent interactions generate macroscopic behaviors and investigate the fundamental role of network topology in determining system dynamics. Inspired by natural systems, we emphasize control strategies that achieve global coordination through localized interventions while considering practical implementation challenges. The chapter concludes by presenting novel frameworks for managing very large agent ensembles and leveraging interacting networks for control purposes.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Online Identification-based Policy Iteration to Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the core mechanisms of indirect data-driven control for unknown systems, focusing on the application of policy iteration (PI) within the context of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal control problem. Specifically, we consider a setting where data is collected sequentially from a linear system subject to exogenous process noise, and is then used to refine estimates of the optimal control policy. We integrate recursive least squares (RLS) for online model estimation within a certainty-equivalent framework, and employ PI to iteratively update the control policy. In this work, we investigate first the convergence behavior of RLS under two different models of adversarial noise, namely point-wise and energy bounded noise, and then we provide a closed-loop analysis of the combined model identification and control design process. This iterative scheme is formulated as an algorithmic dynamical system consisting of the feedback interconnection between two algorithms expressed as discrete-time systems. This system theoretic viewpoint on indirect data-driven control allows us to establish convergence guarantees to the optimal controller in the face of uncertainty caused by noisy data. Simulations illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fault-Tolerant Control for Heterogeneous MAS with Prescribed Performance under Communication Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach employing prescribed performance control to address the distributed fault-tolerant formation control problem in a heterogeneous UAV-UGV cooperative system under a directed interaction topology and communication link failures. The proposed distributed fault-tolerant control scheme enables UAVs to accurately track a virtual leader's trajectory and achieve the desired formation, while ensuring UGVs converge within the convex hull formed by leader UAVs. By accounting for differences in system parameters and state dimensions between UAVs and UGVs, the method leverages performance functions to guarantee predefined transient and steady-state behavior. Additionally, a variable prescribed performance boundary control strategy with an adaptive learning rate is introduced to tackle actuator saturation, ensuring reliable formation tracking in real-world scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Frequency Support from Virtual Power Plants: Minimal Reserve and Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reserve-minimizing and allocation strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) to deliver optimal frequency support. The proposed strategy enables VPPs, acting as aggregators for inverter-based resources (IBRs), to provide optimal frequency support economically. The proposed strategy captures time-varying active power injections, reducing the unnecessary redundancy compared to traditional fixed reserve schemes. Reserve requirements for the VPPs are determined based on system frequency response and safety constraints, ensuring efficient grid support. Furthermore, an energy-based allocation model decomposes power injections for each IBR, accounting for their specific limitations. Numerical experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, highlighting significant financial gains for VPPs, especially as system inertia decreases due to higher renewable energy integration.</description>

      <title>Generalized Passivity Sensitivity Methodology for Small-Signal Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a generalized passivity sensitivity analysis for power system stability studies. The method uncovers the most effective instability mitigation actions for both device-level and system-level investigations. The particular structure of the admittance and nodal models is exploited in the detailed derivation of the passivity sensitivity expressions. These proposed sensitivities are validated for different parameters at device-level and at system-level. Compared to previous stability and sensitivity methods, it does not require detailed system information, such as exact system eigenvalues, while it provides valuable information for a less conservative stable system design. In addition, we demonstrate how to utilize the proposed method through case studies with different converter controls and system-wide insights showing its general applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of distributing a control policy across a network of interconnected units. Distributing controllers in this way has a number of potential advantages, especially in terms of robustness, as the failure of a single unit can be compensated by the activity of others. However, it is not obvious a priori how such network-based controllers should be constructed for any given system and control objective. Here, we propose a synthesis procedure for obtaining dynamical networks that enact well-defined control policies in a model-free manner. We specifically consider an augmented state space consisting of both the plant state and the network states. Solution of an optimization problem in this augmented state space produces a desired objective and specification of the network dynamics. Because of the analytical tractability of this method, we are able to provide convergence and robustness assessments</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with unit vector control design for multivariable polytopic uncertain systems under saturating actuators. For that purpose, we propose LMI-based conditions to design the unit vector control gain such that the origin of the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. Moreover, an optimization problem is provided to obtain an enlarged estimate of the region of attraction of the equilibrium point for the closed-loop system, where the convergence of trajectories is ensured even in the presence of saturation functions. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Multivariable Extremum Seeking Unit-Vector Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates multivariable extremum seeking using unit-vector control. By employing the gradient algorithm and a polytopic embedding of the unknown Hessian matrix, we establish sufficient conditions, expressed as linear matrix inequalities, for designing the unit-vector control gain that ensures finite-time stability of the origin of the average closed-loop error system. Notably, these conditions enable the design of non-diagonal control gains, which provide extra degrees of freedom to the solution. The convergence of the actual closed-loop system to a neighborhood of the unknown extremum point is rigorously proven through averaging analysis for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficacy of the proposed extremum seeking control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Data-Enabled Neighboring Extremal: Case Study on Model-Free Trajectory Tracking for Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) has recently emerged as a powerful data-driven approach for efficient system controls with constraints handling capabilities. It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories.

      <title>Quickest change detection for UAV-based sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of quickest change detection (QCD) at two spatially separated locations monitored by a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a sensor. At any location, the UAV observes i.i.d. data sequentially in discrete time instants. The distribution of the observation data changes at some unknown, arbitrary time and the UAV has to detect this change in the shortest possible time. Change can occur at most at one location over the entire infinite time horizon. The UAV switches between these two locations in order to quickly detect the change. To this end, we propose Location Switching and Change Detection (LS-CD) algorithm which uses a repeated one-sided sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) based mechanism for observation-driven location switching and change detection. The primary goal is to minimize the worst-case average detection delay (WADD) while meeting constraints on the average run length to false alarm (ARL2FA) and the UAV's time-averaged energy consumption. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm's performance by using theory of random walk. Specifically, we derive tight upper and lower bounds to its ARL2FA and a tight upper bound to its WADD. In the special case of a symmetrical setting, our analysis leads to a new asymptotic upper bound to the ARL2FA of the standard CUSUM algorithm, a novel contribution not available in the literature, to our knowledge. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of LS-CD.</description>

      <title>Joint Travel Route Optimization Framework for Platooning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platooning represents an advanced driving technology designed to assist drivers in traffic convoys of varying lengths, enhancing road safety, reducing driver fatigue, and improving fuel efficiency. Sophisticated automated driving assistance systems have facilitated this innovation. Recent advancements in platooning emphasize cooperative mechanisms within both centralized and decentralized architectures enabled by vehicular communication technologies. This study introduces a cooperative route planning optimization framework aimed at promoting the adoption of platooning through a centralized platoon formation strategy at the system level. This approach is envisioned as a transitional phase from individual (ego) driving to fully collaborative driving. Additionally, this research formulates and incorporates travel cost metrics related to fuel consumption, driver fatigue, and travel time, considering regulatory constraints on consecutive driving durations. The performance of these cost metrics has been evaluated using Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms within a network graph framework. The results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves an average cost improvement of 14 % compared to individual route planning for long road trips.</description>

      <title>UWB Anchor Based Localization of a Planetary Rover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization of an autonomous mobile robot during planetary exploration is challenging due to the unknown terrain, the difficult lighting conditions and the lack of any global reference such as satellite navigation systems. We present a novel approach for robot localization based on ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. The robot sets up its own reference coordinate system by distributing UWB anchor nodes in the environment via a rocket-propelled launcher system. This allows the creation of a localization space in which UWB measurements are employed to supplement traditional SLAM-based techniques. The system was developed for our involvement in the ESA-ESRIC challenge 2021 and the AMADEE-24, an analog Mars simulation in Armenia by the Austrian Space Forum (\"OWF).</description>

      <title>On-Chip and Off-Chip TIA Amplifiers for Nanopore Signal Readout Design, Performance and Challenges: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in biomedical research have driven continuous innovations in sensing and diagnostic technologies. Among these, nanopore based single molecule sensing and sequencing is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile sensing methodology. Advancements in nanopore based approaches require concomitant improvements in the electronic readout methods employed, from the point of low noise, bandwidth and form factor. This article focuses on current sensing circuits designed and employed for ultra low noise nanopore signal readout, addressing the fundamental limitations of traditional off chip transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), which suffer from high input parasitic capacitance, bandwidth constraints, and increased noise at high frequencies. This review explores the latest design schemes and circuit structures classified into on-chip and off-chip TIA designs, highlighting their design implementation, performance, respective challenges and explores the interplay between noise performance, capacitance, and bandwidth across diverse transimpedance amplifier (TIA) configurations. Emphasis is placed on characterizing noise response under varying parasitic capacitance and operational frequencies, a systematic evaluation not extensively addressed in prior literature while also considering the allowable input current compliance range limitations. The review also compares the widely used Axopatch 200B system to the designs reported in literature. The findings offer valuable insights into optimizing TIA designs for enhanced signal integrity in high speed and high sensitivity applications focusing on noise reduction, impedance matching, DC blocking, and offset cancellation techniques.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Source Seeking Control for Nonholonomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an event-triggered source seeking control (ET-SSC) for autonomous vehicles modeled as the nonholonomic unicycle. The classical source seeking control is enhanced with static-triggering conditions to enable aperiodic and less frequent updates of the system's input signals, offering a resource-aware control design. Our convergence analysis is based on time-scaling combined with Lyapunov and averaging theories for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. ET-SSC ensures exponentially stable behavior for the resulting average system, leading to practical asymptotic convergence to a small neighborhood of the source point. We guarantee the avoidance of Zeno behavior by establishing a minimum dwell time to prevent infinitely fast switching. The performance optimization is aligned with classical continuous-time source seeking algorithms while balancing system performance with actuation resource consumption. Our ET-SSC algorithm, the first of its kind, allows for arbitrarily large inter-sampling times, overcoming the limitations of classical sampled-data implementations for source seeking control.</description>

      <title>Open Datasets for Grid Modeling and Visualization: An Alberta Power Network Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the power and energy industry, multiple entities in grid operational logs are frequently recorded and updated. Thanks to recent advances in IT facilities and smart metering services, a variety of datasets such as system load, generation mix, and grid connection are often publicly available. While these resources are valuable in evaluating power grid's operational conditions and system resilience, the lack of fine-grained, accurate locational information constrain the usage of current data, which further hinders the development of smart grid and renewables integration. For instance, electricity end users are not aware of nodal generation mix or carbon emissions, while the general public have limited understanding about the effect of demand response or renewables integration if only the whole system's demands and generations are available. In this work, we focus on recovering power grid topology and line flow directions from open public dataset. Taking the Alberta grid as a working example, we start from mapping multi-modal power system datasets to the grid topology integrated with geographical information. By designing a novel optimization-based scheme to recover line flow directions, we are able to analyze and visualize the interactions between generations and demand vectors in an efficient manner. Proposed research is fully open-sourced and highly generalizable, which can help model and visualize grid information, create synthetic dataset, and facilitate analytics and decision-making framework for clean energy transition.</description>

      <title>Robust, positive and exact model reduction via monotone matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of exact model reduction of positive linear systems, by leveraging minimal realization theory. While determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains in general an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of the original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide a systematic method to construct positive reductions also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</description>

      <title>Balanced Truncation via Tangential Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the construction of rth-order truncated balanced realizations via tangential interpolation at r specified interpolation points. It is demonstrated that when the truncated Hankel singular values are negligible-that is, when the discarded states are nearly uncontrollable and unobservable-balanced truncation simplifies to a bi-tangential Hermite interpolation problem at r interpolation points. In such cases, the resulting truncated balanced realization is nearly H2-optimal and thus interpolates the original model at the mirror images of its poles along its residual directions.
  Like standard H2-optimal model reduction, where the interpolation points and tangential directions that yield a local optimum are not known, in balanced truncation as well, the interpolation points and tangential directions required to produce a truncated balanced realization remain unknown. To address this, we propose an iterative tangential interpolation-based algorithm for balanced truncation. Upon convergence, the algorithm yields a low-rank truncated balanced realization that accurately preserves the r largest Hankel singular values of the original system. An adaptive scheme to automatically select the order r of the reduced model is also proposed. The algorithm is fully automatic, choosing both the interpolation data and the model order without user intervention. Additionally, an adaptive low-rank solver for Lyapunov equations based on tangential interpolation is proposed, automatically selecting both the interpolation data and the rank without user intervention. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on benchmark models, confirming their efficacy.</description>

      <title>Attitude Estimation via Matrix Fisher Distributions on SO(3) Using Non-Unit Vector Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note presents a novel Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution on the special orthogonal group, which can smoothly accommodate both unit and non-unit vector measurements. The posterior attitude distribution is proven to be a matrix Fisher distribution with the assumption that non-unit vector measurement errors follow the isotropic Gaussian distributions and unit vector measurements follow the von-Mises Fisher distributions. Next, a global unscented transformation is proposed to approximate the full likelihood distribution with a matrix Fisher distribution for more generic cases of vector measurement errors following the non-isotropic Gaussian distributions. Following these, a Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution is constructed. Numerical examples are then presented. The proposed estimator exhibits advantageous performance compared with the previous attitude estimator with matrix Fisher distributions and the classic multiplicative extended Kalman filter in the case of non-unit vector measurements.</description>

Abstract: This paper revisits and extends the convergence and robustness properties of value and policy iteration algorithms for discrete-time linear quadratic regulator problems. In the model-based case, we extend current results concerning the region of exponential convergence of both algorithms. In the case where there is uncertainty on the value of the system matrices, we provide input-to-state stability results capturing the effect of model parameter uncertainties. Our findings offer new insights into these algorithms at the heart of several approximate dynamic programming schemes, highlighting their convergence and robustness behaviors. Numerical examples illustrate the significance of some of the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates remote synchronization in arbitrary network clusters of coupled nonlinear oscillators, a phenomenon inspired by neural synchronization in the brain. Employing a multi-faceted approach encompassing analytical, numerical, and experimental methodologies, we leverage the Master Stability Function (MSF) to analyze network stability. We provide experimental evidence of remote synchronization between two clusters of nonlinear oscillators, where oscillators within each cluster are also remotely connected. This observation parallels the thalamus-mediated synchronization of neuronal populations in the brain. An electronic circuit testbed, supported by nonlinear ODE modeling and LT Spice simulation, was developed to validate our theoretical predictions. Future work will extend this investigation to encompass diverse network topologies and explore potential applications in neuroscience, communication networks, and power systems.</description>

Abstract: An analog of the describing function method is developed using square waves rather than sinusoids. Static nonlinearities map square waves to square waves, and their behavior is characterized by their response to square waves of varying amplitude - their amplitude response. The output of an LTI system to a square wave input is approximated by a square wave, to give an analog of the describing function. The classical describing function method for predicting oscillations in feedback interconnections is generalized to this square wave setting, and gives accurate predictions when oscillations are approximately square.</description>

      <title>Mode Switching-Induced Instability of Multi-source Feed DC Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In DC microgrids (DCMGs), DC-bus signaling based control strategy is extensively used for power management, where mode switching plays a crucial role in achieving multi-source coordination. However, few studies have noticed the impact of mode switching and switching strategies on system voltage stability. To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide a general analysis framework for mode switching-induced instability in multi-source DCMGs. First, manifold theory is employed to analyze the stability of the DCMG switched system. Subsequently, the instability mechanism and its physical interpretation are explored. The positive feedback activated by the decreasing DC bus voltage during the switching process leads to instability. Switching strategy may inadvertently contribute to this instability. To improve stability, a novel control method based on mode scheduling is proposed, by adjusting switching strategy and thereby correcting the system trajectory. Finally, both real-time simulations and experimental tests on a DCMG system verify the correctness and effectiveness of theoretical analysis results.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Parametric Stability Certificates for Grid-Forming Converter Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Complexity-Certification Framework for Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems, solving optimization problems efficiently and with guarantees on worst-case computational complexity is critical to satisfy the real-time constraints in these applications. These optimization problems often take the form of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) or mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) that depend on system parameters. A common approach for solving such problems is the branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) method. This paper extends existing complexity certification methods by presenting a unified complexity-certification framework for B&amp;B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, specifically for the family of multi-parametric MILP and MIQP problems that arise in, e.g., hybrid MPC applications. The framework provides guarantees on worst-case computational measures, including the maximum number of iterations or relaxations B&amp;B algorithms require to reach optimality. It systematically accounts for different branching and node selection strategies, as well as heuristics integrated into B&amp;B, ensuring a comprehensive certification framework. By offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights for solver customization, the proposed framework enhances the reliability of B&amp;B for real-time application. The usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both random MILPs and MIQPs, as well as on MIQPs arising from a hybrid MPC problem.</description>

      <title>Parallel Domain-Decomposition Algorithms for Complexity Certification of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When implementing model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems with a linear or a quadratic performance measure, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) or a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) needs to be solved, respectively, at each sampling instant. Recent work has introduced the possibility to certify the computational complexity of branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) algorithms when solving MILP and MIQP problems formulated as multi-parametric MILPs (mp-MILPs) and mp-MIQPs. Such a framework allows for computing the worst-case computational complexity of standard B&amp;B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, quantified by metrics such as the total number of LP/QP iterations and B&amp;B nodes. These results are highly relevant for real-time hybrid MPC applications. In this paper, we extend this framework by developing parallel, domain-decomposition versions of the previously proposed algorithm, allowing it to scale to larger problem sizes and enable the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Furthermore, to reduce peak memory consumption, we introduce two novel modifications to the existing (serial) complexity certification framework, integrating them into the proposed parallel algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the parallel algorithms significantly reduce computation time while maintaining the correctness of the original framework.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-Based Pinning Control Strategy for Enhanced Synchronization in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is essential for the stability and coordinated operation of complex networked systems. Pinning control, which selectively controls a subset of nodes, provides a scalable solution to enhance network synchronizability. However, existing strategies face key limitations: heuristic centrality-based methods lack a direct connection to synchronization dynamics, while spectral approaches, though effective, are computationally intensive. To address these challenges, we propose a perturbation-based optimized strategy (PBO) that dynamically evaluates each node's spectral impact on the Laplacian matrix, achieving improved synchronizability with significantly reduced computational costs (with complexity O(kM)). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional strategies in synchronizability, convergence rate, and pinning robustness to node failures. Notably, in all the empirical networks tested and some generated networks, PBO significantly outperforms the brute-force greedy strategy, demonstrating its ability to avoid local optima and adapt to complex connectivity patterns. Our study establishes the theoretical relationship between network synchronizability and convergence rate, offering new insights into efficient synchronization strategies for large-scale complex networks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Control Barrier Functions for Nonholonomic Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of guaranteeing safety of multiple coordinated agents moving in dynamic environments. It has recently been shown that this problem can be efficiently solved through the notion of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). However, for nonholonomic vehicles that are required to keep positive speeds, existing CBFs lose their validity. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid formulation based on synergistic CBFs (SCBFs), which leverages a discrete switching mechanism to avoid configurations that would render the CBF invalid. Unlike existing approaches, our method ensures safety in the presence of moving obstacles and inter-agent interactions while respecting nonzero speed restrictions. We formally analyze the feasibility of the constraints with respect to actuation limits, and the efficacy of the solution is demonstrated in simulation of a multi-agent coordination problem in the presence of moving obstacles.</description>

      <title>SigmaRL: A Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source, decentralized framework named SigmaRL, designed to enhance both sample efficiency and generalization of multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for motion planning of connected and automated vehicles. Most RL agents exhibit a limited capacity to generalize, often focusing narrowly on specific scenarios, and are usually evaluated in similar or even the same scenarios seen during training. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges, including experience replay and regularization. However, how observation design in RL affects sample efficiency and generalization remains an under-explored area. We address this gap by proposing five strategies to design information-dense observations, focusing on general features that are applicable to most traffic scenarios. We train our RL agents using these strategies on an intersection and evaluate their generalization through numerical experiments across completely unseen traffic scenarios, including a new intersection, an on-ramp, and a roundabout. Incorporating these information-dense observations reduces training times to under one hour on a single CPU, and the evaluation results reveal that our RL agents can effectively zero-shot generalize.

      <title>Scheduling Policies in a Multi-Source Status Update System with Dedicated and Shared Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Use of multi-path network topologies has become a prominent technique to assert timeliness in terms of age of information (AoI) and to improve resilience to link disruptions in communication systems. However, establishing multiple dedicated communication links among network nodes is a costly endeavor. Therefore, quite often, these secondary communication links are shared among multiple entities. Moreover, these multi-path networks come with the added challenge of out-of-order transmissions. In this paper, we study an amalgamation of the above two aspects, i.e., multi-path transmissions and link sharing. In contrast to the existing literature where the main focus has been scheduling multiple sources on a single shared server, we delve into the realm where each source sharing the shared server is also supplemented with its dedicated server so as to improve its timeliness. In this multi-path link sharing setting with generate-at-will transmissions, we first present the optimal probabilistic scheduler, and then propose several heuristic-based cyclic scheduling algorithms for the shared server, to minimize the weighted average age of information of the sources.</description>

      <title>Exact Model Reduction for Continuous-Time Open Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

      <title>Coordinated vehicle dispatching and charging scheduling for an electric ride-hailing fleet under charging congestion and dynamic prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective utilization of charging station capacity plays an important role in enhancing the profitability of ride-hailing systems using electric vehicles. Existing studies assume constant energy prices and uncapacitated charging stations or do not explicitly consider vehicle queueing at charging stations, resulting in over-optimistic charging infrastructure utilization. In this study, we develop a dynamic charging scheduling method (named CongestionAware) that anticipates vehicles' energy needs and coordinates their charging operations with real-time energy prices to avoid long waiting time at charging stations and increase the total profit of the system. A sequential mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to devise vehicles' day-ahead charging plans based on their experienced charging waiting times and energy consumption. The obtained charging plans are adapted within the day in response to vehicles' energy needs and charging station congestion. The developed charging policy is tested using NYC yellow taxi data in a Manhattan-like study area with a fleet size of 100 vehicles given the scenarios of 3000 and 4000 customers per day. The computational results show that our CongestionAware policy outperforms different benchmark policies with up to +15.06% profit and +19.16% service rate for 4000 customers per day. Sensitivity analysis is conducted with different system parameters and managerial insights are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reachability-Guaranteed Optimal Control for the Interception of Dynamic Targets under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intercepting dynamic objects in uncertain environments involves a significant unresolved challenge in modern robotic systems. Current control approaches rely solely on estimated information, and results lack guarantees of robustness and feasibility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to tackle the interception of targets whose motion is affected by known and bounded uncertainty. Our approach introduces new techniques of reachability analysis for rigid bodies, leveraged to guarantee feasibility of interception under uncertain conditions. We then propose a Reachability-Guaranteed Optimal Control Problem, ensuring robustness and guaranteed reachability to a target set of configurations. We demonstrate the methodology in the case study of an interception maneuver of a tumbling target in space.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Approximate Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Motion Cueing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCAs) encode the movement of simulated vehicles into movement that can be reproduced with a motion simulator to provide a realistic driving experience within the capabilities of the machine. This paper introduces a novel learning-based MCA for serial robot-based motion simulators. Building on the differentiable predictive control framework, the proposed method merges the advantages of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) - notably nonlinear constraint handling and accurate kinematic modeling - with the computational efficiency of machine learning. By shifting the computational burden to offline training, the new algorithm enables real-time operation at high control rates, thus overcoming the key challenge associated with NMPC-based motion cueing. The proposed MCA incorporates a nonlinear joint-space plant model and a policy network trained to mimic NMPC behavior while accounting for joint acceleration, velocity, and position limits. Simulation experiments across multiple motion cueing scenarios showed that the proposed algorithm performed on par with a state-of-the-art NMPC-based alternative in terms of motion cueing quality as quantified by the RMSE and correlation coefficient with respect to reference signals. However, the proposed algorithm was on average 400 times faster than the NMPC baseline. In addition, the algorithm successfully generalized to unseen operating conditions, including motion cueing scenarios on a different vehicle and real-time physics-based simulations.</description>
