      <title>Relational Network Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational network verification is a new approach to validating network changes. In contrast to traditional network verification, which analyzes specifications for a single network snapshot, relational network verification analyzes specifications concerning two network snapshots (e.g., pre- and post-change snapshots) and captures their similarities and differences. Relational change specifications are compact and precise because they specify the flows or paths that change between snapshots and then simply mandate that other behaviors of the network "stay the same", without enumerating them. To achieve similar guarantees, single-snapshot specifications need to enumerate all flow and path behaviors that are not expected to change, so we can check that nothing has accidentally changed. Thus, precise single-snapshot specifications are proportional to network size, which makes them impractical to generate for many real-world networks.
  To demonstrate the value of relational reasoning, we develop a high-level relational specification language and a tool called Rela to validate network changes. Rela first compiles input specifications and network snapshot representations to finite state transducers. It then checks compliance using decision procedures for automaton equivalence. Our experiments using data on complex changes to a global backbone (with over 10^3 routers) find that Rela specifications need fewer than 10 terms for 93% of them and it validates 80% of them within 20 minutes.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Resource Management in Joint Communication and Computing-Embedded SAGIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the 6G era aims for ubiquitous connectivity, with the integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) offering extensive coverage and enhanced capacity. As manufacturing advances and user demands evolve, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) with computational capabilities emerge as a viable solution for services requiring low latency and high computational power. Resource management within joint communication and computing-embedded SAGIN (JCC-SAGIN) presents greater complexity than traditional terrestrial networks. This complexity arises from the spatiotemporal dynamics of network topology and service demand, the interdependency of large-scale resource variables, and intricate tradeoffs among various performance metrics. Thus, a thorough examination of resource management strategies in JCC-SAGIN is crucial, emphasizing the role of non-terrestrial platforms with processing capabilities in 6G. This paper begins by reviewing the architecture, enabling technologies, and applications in JCC-SAGIN. Then, we offer a detailed overview of resource management modeling and optimization methods, encompassing both traditional optimization approaches and learning-based intelligent decision-making frameworks. Finally, we outline the prospective research directions in JCC-SAGIN.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Radio Spectrum Regulation Workflows with Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless spectrum regulation is a complex and demanding process due to the rapid pace of technological progress, increasing demand for spectrum, and a multitude of stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests, alongside significant economic implications. To navigate this, regulators must engage effectively with all parties, keep pace with global technology trends, conduct technical evaluations, issue licenses in a timely manner, and comply with various legal and policy frameworks.
  In light of these challenges, this paper demonstrates example applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) to expedite spectrum regulatory processes. We explore various roles that LLMs can play in this context while identifying some of the challenges to address. The paper also offers practical case studies and insights, with appropriate experiments, highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs in spectrum management.</description>

      <title>A survey on road safety and traffic efficiency vehicular applications based on C-V2X technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the use of cellular network technologies to provide communication-based applications to vehicles has received considerable attention. 3GPP, the standardization body responsible for cellular networks specifications, is developing technologies to meet the requirements of vehicular communication applications, and the research community is testing and validating the ability of those technologies to implement different applications. This survey presents the body of work dealing with the use of cellular technologies to implement communication-based applications for the connected vehicle. We focus on basic and advanced road safety and traffic efficiency applications, which are critically important for the future of vehicular networks. We start by describing the different cellular-related technologies that have a role to play in providing services to the connected vehicle, propose a classification of types of communication used in vehicular applications, and then apply this classification to organize and present recent research work on the topic. Finally, we identify the main challenges in the use of cellular technologies to develop applications for the connected vehicle.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Transmission in UAV-Aided LoRa Networks Featuring Wake-Up Radios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a LoRa sensor network featuring a UAV-mounted gateway for collecting sensor data (messages). Wake-up radios (WuR) are employed to inform the sensors of the UAV's arrival. Building on an existing random access scheme for such setups, we propose and evaluate two redundancy transmission protocols for enhancing the reliability of the data transfer. One protocol employs fountain-coded transmissions, whereas the other performs message replication. Our results illustrate how redundancy transmission can be beneficial under the time constraints imposed by the UAV's limited hovering duration, and how node density, hovering time, and sensor energy budget impact the performance of the schemes.</description>
