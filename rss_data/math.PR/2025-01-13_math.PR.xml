      <title>Limit theorems for the generator of a symmetric Levy process with the delta potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional symmetric Levy process that has local time. In the first part, we construct a self-adjoint extension of the generator of the process so that the constructed operator corresponds to the generator with the delta potential. Using the constructed operator, we extend the Feynman-Kac formula to the case of delta function-type potentials and prove a limit theorem for an operator semigroup corresponding to this formula. In the second part, we construct a one-parameter family of distributions that attract the sample paths of the process to a given point. We show that this family weakly converges to the distribution of a Feller process and prove a limit theorem for the distribution of a point where an attracted sample path comes.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of walks in multidimensional orthants and reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider (random) walks in a multidimensional orthant. Using the idea of universality in probability theory, one can associate a unique polyhedral domain to any given walk model. We use this connection to prove two sets of new results. First, we are interested in a group of transformations naturally associated with any small step model; as it turns out, this group is central to the classification of walk models. We show a strong connection between this group and the reflection group through the walls of the polyhedral domain. As a consequence, we can derive various conditions for the combinatorial group to be infinite. Secondly, we consider the asymptotics of the number of excursions, whose critical exponent is known to be computable in terms of the eigenvalue of the above polyhedral domain. We prove new results from spectral theory on the eigenvalues of polyhedral nodal domains. We believe that these results are interesting in their own right; they can also be used to find new exact asymptotic results for walk models corresponding to these nodal polyhedral domains.</description>

      <title>Lonely passenger problem: the more buses there are, the more lonely passengers there will be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empty buses are standing at a bus station. $n$ passengers arrive, and they each board a bus completely at random (meaning that they choose uniformly and independently). Then all buses depart. We show that the more buses there are, the more likely it is that someone (i.e. at least one passenger) travels alone (while $n$ is fixed). More generally, we show that the number of lonely passengers increases with the number of buses, in the sense of stochastic dominance. This problem turned out to be surprisingly difficult, with no short solution known to the author so far, despite the efforts of many experts. Some of the results can also be formulated as properties of Stirling numbers of the second kind.</description>

      <title>Averaging over the circles the gaussian free field in the Poincar{\'e} disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gaussian free field on the unit disk $D$ can be seen as a two-dimensional version of the Brownian bridge on the interval [0,1]. It is intrinsically associated with the Sobolev space $H_0^1 (D)$. To define the latter, we can choose any metric conformally equivalent to the Euclidean metric on $D$. This note is an introduction to the gaussian free field on the unit disk whose aim is to highlight some of the conveniences offered by hyperbolic geometryon $D$ to describe the first properties of this probabilistic object.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and asymptotic stability of invariant measures for the stochastic Allen-Cahn-Navier-Stokes system with singular potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of a stochastic Allen-Cahn-Navier-Stokes system modelling the dynamics of binary mixtures of immiscible fluids. The model features two stochastic forcings, one on the velocity in the Navier-Stokes equation and one on the phase variable in the Allen-Cahn equation, and includes the thermodynamically-relevant Flory-Huggins logarithhmic potential. We first show existence of ergodic invariant measures and characterise their support by exploiting ad-hoc regularity estimates and suitable Feller-type and Markov properties. Secondly, we prove that if the noise acting in the Navier-Stokes equation is non-degenerate along a sufficiently large number of low modes, and the Allen-Cahn equation is highly dissipative, then the stochastic flow admits a unique invariant measure and is asymptotically stable with respect to a suitable Wasserstein metric.</description>

      <title>Exploring Metastability in Ising models: critical droplets, energy barriers and exit time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the research on the metastable behavior of the Ising model. We analyze the transition times from the set of metastable states to the set of the stable states by identifying the critical configurations that the system crosses with high probability during this transition and by computing the energy barrier that the system must overcome to reach the stable state starting from the metastable one. We describe the dynamical phase transition of the Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics across various contexts, including different lattices, dimensions and anisotropic variants. The analysis is extended to related models, such as long-range Ising model, Blume-Capel and Potts models, as well as to dynamics like Kawasaki dynamics, providing insights into metastability across different systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic equations with singular drift driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic differential equation $$ d X_t=b(X_t) dt +d W_t^H, $$ where the drift $b$ is either a measure or an integrable function, and $W^H$ is a $d$-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$. For the case where $b\in L_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $p\in[1,\infty]$ we show weak existence of solutions to this equation under the condition $$ \frac{d}p&lt;\frac1H-1, $$ which is an extension of the Krylov-R\"ockner condition (2005) to the fractional case. We construct a counter-example showing optimality of this condition. If $b$ is a Radon measure, particularly the delta measure, we prove weak existence of solutions to this equation under the optimal condition $H&lt;\frac1{d+1}$. We also show strong well-posedness of solutions to this equation under certain conditions. To establish these results, we utilize the stochastic sewing technique and develop a new version of the stochastic sewing lemma.</description>

      <title>New lower bounds for the (near) critical Ising and $\varphi^4$ models' two-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nearest-neighbour Ising and $\varphi^4$ models on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d\geq 3$ and obtain new lower bounds on their two-point functions at (and near) criticality. Together with the classical infrared bound, these bounds turn into up-to constant estimates when $d\geq 5$. When $d=4$, we obtain an ''almost'' sharp lower bound corrected by a logarithmic factor. As a consequence of these results, we show that $\eta=0$ and $\nu=1/2$ when $d\geq 4$, where $\eta$ is the critical exponent associated with the decay of the model's two-point function at criticality and $\nu$ is the critical exponent of the correlation length $\xi(\beta)$. When $d=3$, we improve previous results and obtain that $\eta\leq 1/2$. As a byproduct of our proofs, we also derive the blow-up at criticality of the so-called bubble diagram when $d=3,4$.</description>

      <title>Imprecise Markov Semigroups and their Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an imprecise Markov semigroup $\mathbf{Q}$. It is a tool that allows to represent ambiguity around both the initial and the transition probabilities of a Markov process via a compact collection of Markov semigroups, each associated with a (possibly different) Markov process. We use techniques from set theory, topology, geometry, and probability to study the ergodic behavior of $\mathbf{Q}$. We show that, if the initial distribution of the Markov processes associated with the elements of $\mathbf{Q}$ is known and invariant, under some conditions that also involve the geometry of the state space, eventually the ambiguity around their transition probability fades. We call this property ergodicity of the imprecise Markov semigroup, and we relate it to the classical notion of ergodicity. We prove ergodicity both when the state space is Euclidean or a Riemannian manifold, and when it is an arbitrary measurable space. The importance of our findings for the fields of machine learning and computer vision is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic flow out of a segment for Activated Random Walks in dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04510v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activated Random Walk is a system of interacting particles which presents a phase transition and a conjectured phenomenon of self-organized criticality. In this note, we prove that, in dimension 1, in the supercritical case, when a segment is stabilized with particles being killed when they jump out of the segment, a positive fraction of the particles leaves the segment with positive probability.
  This was already known to be a sufficient condition for being in the active phase of the model, and the result of this paper is that this condition is also necessary, except maybe precisely at the critical point. This result can also be seen as a partial answer to some of the many conjectures which connect the different points of view on the phase transition of the model.</description>

      <title>Structure preservation via the Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that under minimal assumptions on a random vector $X\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and with high probability, given $m$ independent copies of $X$, the coordinate distribution of each vector $(\langle X_i,\theta \rangle)_{i=1}^m$ is dictated by the distribution of the true marginal $\langle X,\theta \rangle$. Specifically, we show that with high probability, \[\sup_{\theta \in S^{d-1}} \left( \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \left|\langle X_i,\theta \rangle^\sharp - \lambda^\theta_i \right|^2 \right)^{1/2} \leq c \left( \frac{d}{m} \right)^{1/4},\] where $\lambda^{\theta}_i = m\int_{(\frac{i-1}{m}, \frac{i}{m}]} F_{ \langle X,\theta \rangle }^{-1}(u)\,du$ and $a^\sharp$ denotes the monotone non-decreasing rearrangement of $a$. Moreover, this estimate is optimal.
  The proof follows from a sharp estimate on the worst Wasserstein distance between a marginal of $X$ and its empirical counterpart, $\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta_{\langle X_i, \theta \rangle}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the question of determining the probability of triangle count deviations in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G(n,m)$ and $G(n,p)$ with densities larger than $n^{-1/2}(\log{n})^{1/2}$. In particular, we determine the log probability $\log\mathbb{P}(N_{\triangle}(G)\, &gt;\, (1+\delta)p^3n^3)$ up to a constant factor across essentially the entire range of possible deviations, in both the $G(n,m)$ and $G(n,p)$ model. For the $G(n,p)$ model we also prove a stronger result, up to a $(1+o(1))$ factor, in the non-localised regime. We also obtain some results for the lower tail and for counts of cherries (paths of length $2$).</description>

      <title>A Dean-Kawasaki equation for reaction diffusion systems driven by Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic partial differential equation that describes the fluctuating behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems of N particles, undergoing Markovian, unary reactions. This generalises the work of Dean [J. Phys. A: Math. and Gen., 29 (24), L613, (1996)] through the inclusion of random Poisson fields. Our approach is based on weak interactions, which has the dual benefit that the resulting equations asymptotically converge (in the N to infinity limit) on a variation of a McKean- Vlasov diffusion, whilst still being related to the case of Dean-like strong interactions via a trivial rescaling.

      <title>Rigidity of the subelliptic heat kernel on $\operatorname{SU}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study heat kernel rigidity for the Lie group $\operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)$ kernel equipped with a sub-Riemannian structure. We prove that a metric measure space equipped with a heat kernel of a special form is bundle-isometric to the Hopf fibration $\operatorname{U}\left( 1 \right)\to \operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)\to \mathbb{CP}^1$, which coincides with the sub-Riemannian sphere $\operatorname{SU}\left( 2 \right)$.</description>

      <title>Local Order Controls the Onset of Oscillations in the Nonreciprocal Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in the nonreciprocal Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying nontrivial spatiotemporal correlations. Long-lived states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium trapped states and a loss of ergodic behavior via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the nonreciprocal Ising model beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Valuation Model of Chinese Convertible Bonds Based on Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06496v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of pricing Chinese convertible bonds(CCBs) using Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming. At each exercise time, we use the state variables of the underlying stock to regress the continuation value, and apply standard backward induction to get the coefficients from the current time to time zero. This process ultimately determines the CCB price. We then apply this pricing method in simulations and evaluate an underpriced strategy: taking long positions in the 10 most undervalued CCBs and rebalancing daily. The results show that this strategy significantly outperforms the benchmark double-low strategy. In practice, CCB issuers often use a downward adjustment clause to prevent financial distress when a put provision is triggered. Therefore, we model the downward adjustment clause as a probabilistic event that triggers the put provision, thereby integrating it with the put provision in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Existence of long-range order in random-field Ising model on Dyson hierarchical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the random-field Ising model on a Dyson hierarchical lattice, where the interactions decay in a power-law-like form, $J(r)\sim r^{-\alpha}$, with respect to the distance. Without a random field, the Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice has a long-range order at finite low temperatures when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. In this study, for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3/2$, we rigorously prove that there is a long-range order in the random-field Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice at finite low temperatures, including zero temperature, when the strength of the random field is sufficiently small but nonzero. Our proof is based on Dyson's method for the case without a random field, and the concentration inequalities in probability theory enable us to evaluate the effect of a random field.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional classification problems with Barron regular boundaries under margin conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a classifier with a Barron-regular decision boundary can be approximated with a rate of high polynomial degree by ReLU neural networks with three hidden layers when a margin condition is assumed. In particular, for strong margin conditions, high-dimensional discontinuous classifiers can be approximated with a rate that is typically only achievable when approximating a low-dimensional smooth function. We demonstrate how these expression rate bounds imply fast-rate learning bounds that are close to $n^{-1}$ where $n$ is the number of samples. In addition, we carry out comprehensive numerical experimentation on binary classification problems with various margins. We study three different dimensions, with the highest dimensional problem corresponding to images from the MNIST data set.</description>

      <title>Uniform doubling for abelian products with $\operatorname{SU}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the uniform doubling property holds for every Lie group which can be written as a quotient group of $\operatorname{SU}(2) \times \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$. In particular, this class includes the four-dimensional unitary group $\operatorname{U}(2)$. As this class contain non-compact as well as compact Lie groups, we discuss a number of analytic and spectral consequences for the corresponding heat kernels.</description>
