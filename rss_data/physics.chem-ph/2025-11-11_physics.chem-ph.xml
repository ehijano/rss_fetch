      <title>Looking Inside the Widom Region: Non-Equilibrium Stratification in Supercritical CO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supercritical state of matter is usually described as a continuous phase without sharp boundaries between liquid and gas regions. However, under non-equilibrium conditions, this view breaks down. Here we report an experimental investigation of non-equilibrium fluctuations in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) subjected to a stabilising temperature gradient. Using shadowgraphy, we reveal spontaneous stratification of the fluid into different layers, separated by transition regions, where thermodynamic properties vary dramatically. These signatures are particularly evident when the system crosses the Widom lines, loci of the extrema of the response function in the supercritical domain. The analysis of the intermediate scattering function of temperature fluctuations highlights the presence of Brunt-Vaisala oscillations within the fluid at multiple frequencies. These oscillations arise from the coupling of thermal and viscous modes under gravity and are a clear signature of the layered structure of the fluid. Our approach enables systematic exploration of a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in a single experiment. These findings suggest that the Widom region cannot be described as a homogeneous phase, but rather as a dynamic assembly of phase-like behaviours, challenging the applicability of classical thermodynamics in non-equilibrium supercritical regimes.</description>

      <title>Gas Mixture Diffusion and Distribution in the Porous ZIF-90 Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how gas mixtures diffuse and distribute within porous frameworks is central to designing advanced separation and storage materials. Here, we investigate the transport and spatial distribution of binary gas mixtures in a porous metal organic framework, viz., ZIF-90, using molecular simulations. We perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to examine the competitive adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from a binary gas mixture in ZIF-90, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to investigate the transport behavior of the adsorbed molecules within the framework. These integrated simulations reveal that the framework topology and pore chemistry jointly dictate diffusion pathways and preferential occupancy of gas species, underscoring their intrinsic interdependence. Competitive adsorption leads to distinct spatial partitioning within the pores, which in turn modulates mixture diffusivity inside the porous medium compared to their bulk properties. Our results provide molecular-level insight into how ZIF-90 accommodates and separates gas mixtures, offering design principles for optimizing metal-organic frameworks in energy and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Performance of Automatic Active Space Selection for Electronic Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation of electronic spectra is one of the most important applications of methods capturing static electron correlation, including complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and post-CASSCF theories. Performance of these techniques critically depends on the active space construction, both in terms of accuracy and computational effort. In this work we benchmark the performance of automatic active space construction, as implemented in the Active Space Finder software, for the computation of electronic excitation energies. The multi-step procedure constructs meaningful molecular orbitals and selects the most suitable active space based on information from more approximate correlated calculations. It aims to tackle a key difficulty in computing excitation energies with CASSCF: choosing active spaces that are balanced for several electronic states. The Active Space Finder is tested with several established data sets of small and medium-sized molecules and shows encouraging results. We evaluate multiple setting configurations and provide practical recommendations.</description>

      <title>Unifying Decoherence and Phase Evolution in Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics through Exact Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new mixed quantum-classical equations of motion within the exact factorization framework to describe electronic coherence and phase evolution simultaneously. The derivation reveals that not only a projected quantum momentum correction, recently identified by Arribas and Maitra [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 233201 (2024)], but also a phase-correction appears within the order of $\hbar$, providing a unified and rigorous account of electronic coherence and phase evolution as well as their effect on the nuclear force. Benchmark tests on one- and two-dimensional model systems demonstrate that the new formulations capture key nonadiabatic features with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>A reduced-cost third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction based on state-specific frozen natural orbitals: Application to the electron-attachment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a reduced-cost non-Dyson third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction theory for the electron-attachment problem based on state-specific frozen natural orbitals. Density fitting and truncated natural auxiliary functions were employed to enhance computational efficiency. The use of state-specific frozen natural orbitals significantly decreases the virtual space and provides a notable speedup over the conventional EA-ADC(3) method with a systematically controllable accuracy. A perturbative correction for the truncated natural orbitals significantly reduces the error in the calculated electron affinity values. The method also shows sufficient accuracy in the case of non-valence correlation-bound anions, where the local approximation-based methods fail. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by performing an EA-ADC(3) calculation with more than 1300 basis functions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the precipitation distribution by radius and pore size during drying of an impregnated sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of preparing heterogeneous catalysts on porous supports includes a drying stage, in which the porous material, impregnated with an aqueous solution of the catalyst precursor, is dried, and the precursor is precipitated on the pore walls. The precipitate distribution throughout the support volume strongly influences the catalyst performance and durability within industrial reactors. This paper presents a mathematical model for simulating the precipitation distribution during the drying of a porous sphere. Examples of calculations are given demonstrating the influence of some parameters on the distribution by space and by pore size.17</description>

      <title>Electron-nucleus Araki-Sucher correction in the hydrogen molecule isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07053v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum electrodynamic Araki-Sucher correction arising from the interaction between electrons and nuclei is calculated for rovibrational energy levels of the hydrogen molecule and its isotopologues. The corresponding expectation value $\langle r_{en}^{-3}\rangle$ is evaluated across a wide range of internuclear distances using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The electronic wave function is represented as a linear combination of explicitly correlated Gaussian basis functions. This correction contributes approximately tenths of a megahertz (about $10^{-5}$cm$^{-1}$) to the dissociation energy of rovibrational levels and to the transitions between them. Given recent spectroscopic measurements with an accuracy of 10 kHz, this correction is necessary to achieve sub-MHz agreement between theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Offset-Free Robust Nonlinear Control Using Data-Driven Model: A Nonlinear Multi-Model Computationally Efficient Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust model predictive control (MPC) aims to preserve performance under model-plant mismatch, yet robust formulations for nonlinear MPC (NMPC) with data-driven surrogates remain limited. This work proposes an offset-free robust NMPC scheme based on symbolic regression (SR). Using a compact NARX structure, we identify interpretable surrogate models that explicitly represent epistemic (structural) uncertainty at the operating-zone level, and we enforce robustness by embedding these models as hard constraints. gest margins. The single-zone variant (RNMPC$_{SZ}$) was investigated. Synthetic data were generated within one operating zone to identify SR models that are embedded as constraints, while the nominal predictor remains fixed, and the multi-zone variant (RNMPC$_{MZ}$), zone-specific SR models from multiple operating zones are jointly enforced in the constraint set; at each set-point change, the nominal predictor is re-scheduled to the SR model of the newly active zone. In both cases, robustness is induced by the intersection of the admissible sets defined by the enforced SR models, without modifying the nominal cost or introducing ancillary tube dynamics. The approach was validated on a simulated pilot-scale electric submersible pump (ESP) system with pronounced nonlinearities and dynamically varying safety envelopes (downthrust and upthrust). RNMPC$_{SZ}$ and RNMPC$_{MZ}$ maintained disturbance tracking and rejection, and by intersecting models in the constraints, they increased margins and eliminated violations (especially near the upthrust), with a slight increase in settling time. Including up to four models per zone did not increase the time per iteration, maintaining real-time viability; RNMPC$_{MZ}$ presented the lar</description>

      <title>Single-Atom Photocatalysts on TiO2 : Insights from X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface modification of TiO2 with single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective strategy for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. However, thorough characterization of SACs at the atomic scale remains challenging. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) offers unique advantages for the in-depth analysis of TiO2-supported SACs. By employing XAS, the local atomic structure, oxidation state, and electronic properties of the SACs, as well as the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, can be revealed. Herein, we present a short review on the application of XAS in studying TiO2-supported SACs. We first elucidate the key role of XAS in simultaneously probing the structure and electronic properties of monometallic SACs across different periods. Next, we discuss XAS studies of bimetallic SACs from the perspective of each constituent element and highlight the element-specific capabilities of XAS for analyzing multi-element SACs. Finally, we demonstrate how in situ XAS can effectively monitor structural and electronic property changes in SACs under real photocatalytic reaction conditions. Additionally, we provide practical suggestions for utilizing XAS more efficiently in the analysis of various SAC systems.</description>

      <title>The Role and Mechanism of Deep Statistical Machine Learning In Biological Target Screening and Immune Microenvironment Regulation of Asthma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an important source of small molecule drugs, natural products show remarkable biological activities with their rich types and unique structures. However, due to the limited number of samples and structural complexity, the rapid discovery of lead compounds is limited. Therefore, in this study, natural inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) and Phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7) were screened by combining computer aided drug design (CADD) technology and deep learning method, and their activities were verified by enzyme activity experiment and enzymo-linked immunoassay. These two enzymes have important application potential in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, but PDE4 inhibitors may cause adverse reactions, so it is particularly important to develop both effective and safe dual-target inhibitors. In addition, as a potential target of hyperuricemia, the development of natural inhibitors of xanthine oxidase (X0) is also of great value. We used pharmacophore technology for virtual screening, combined with molecular docking technology to improve accuracy, and finally selected 16 potential natural inhibitors of PDE4/7, and verified their binding stability through molecular dynamics simulation. The results of this study laid a foundation for establishing an efficient dual-target inhibitor screening system and exploring the lead compounds of novel X0 inhibitors.</description>

      <title>Alexander Dalgarno and the development of astrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry arose during the 1970s as observations in previously unexplored parts of the electromagnetic spectrum began to reveal the extent of a molecular component of interstellar matter with a surprisingly rich chemistry. Astrochemistry expanded further in order to explain the role of atomic and molecular processes in a broad range of phenomena in the universe. It is instructive to describe the current scope of astrochemistry using the career and accomplishments of Alexander Dalgarno as an organizing principle. Dalgarno helped to establish a self-sustaining community of astrochemists around the world. His own research interests highlight the early development of astrochemistry and anticipate much of its later evolution. His theoretical investigations of fundamental atomic and molecular processes lie at the heart of the subject.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within density-functional theory, Moreau-Yosida regularization enables both a reformulation of the theory and a mathematically well-defined definition of the Kohn-Sham approach. It is further employed in density-potential inversion schemes and, through the choice of topology for the density and potential space, can be directly linked to classical field theories. This perspective collects various appearances of the regularization technique within density-functional theory alongside possibilities for their future development.</description>

      <title>A Strain-Engineered 0D/1D Heterojunction of InVO4/Cu-TbFeO3 for High- Selectivity CO2 Photoreduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The catalytic CO2 photoreduction to CO is significantly hindered by the pervasive kinetic bottleneck of *CO-desorption and inefficient charge separation. Surpassing the conventional single photocatalytic strategy, herein, a multi-synergetic 0D/1D S-scheme heterojunction by precisely assembling 0D InVO4 nanoparticles on 1D Cu-doped TbFeO3 (IVO/CTFO). This nano-heterojunction is rationally designed at multiple steps where Cu2+ substitution at the Fe3+ site induces a compression in lattice strain and oxygen vacancies (VO), acting as electron traps and CO2 chemisorption sites, which breaks spin-polarization of pristine TbFeO3 to facilitate multichannel charge flow. The 0D/1D strategy couples the maximum surface active-sites and short charge diffusion routes with directional charge migration. Moreover, a 0D/1D lattice mismatch creates a built-in electric field at the interface, resulting in an enhanced lifetime (64.70 ns) of charged species, an efficient CO yield (65.75 mmole g-1.h-1), and high selectivity (95.93%). DFT calculations and experimental findings confirmed the Fermi level shift toward the conduction band and the existence of spin-hybridization. Operando-DRIFTS and the free-energy diagram unveil a H+ mediated mechanism at the interface, alongside a reduction in energy barrier for CO2 photoreduction from *COOH to *CO. Thus, this study presents an excellent approach that integrates defect-engineering, strain-compression, and interfacial design in advancing solar fuels production.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Accurate, and Reactive Equivariant Foundation Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07249v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are changing atomistic simulations in the field of chemistry and materials science. However, constructing a single universal MLIP that can accurately model molecular and crystalline systems remains challenging. A central obstacle is the integration of diverse datasets generated under different computational conditions. We present Total Energy Alignment (TEA), which is an approach that enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous quantum chemical datasets without redundant calculations. Using TEA, we trained MACE-Osaka24, the first open-source MLIP model based on a unified dataset covering molecular and crystalline systems. This universal model displays strong performances across diverse chemical systems, exhibiting similar or improved accuracies in predicting organic reaction barriers compared to those of specialized models, while effectively maintaining state-of-the-art accuracies for inorganic systems. These advancements pave the way for accelerated discoveries in the fields of chemistry and materials science via genuine foundation models for chemistry.</description>

      <title>A Reusable Library for Second-Order Orbital Optimization Using the Trust Region Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a reusable, open-source software implementation of the second-order trust region algorithm in the new OpenTrustRegion library. We apply the implementation to the general-purpose optimization of molecular orbitals in various contexts within electronic-structure theory. Our permissibly licensed implementation can be included in any software package, be it free and open-source, academically licensed closed-source, or commercial. Detailing the implementation in OpenTrustRegion, we present a review of the theory behind trust region-based methods alongside various extensions. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our optimization library with extensive benchmarks for self-consistent field calculations, orbital localization, as well as orbital symmetrization tasks, featuring challenging and pathological systems.</description>

      <title>Wetting Transparency of Graphene: A macroscopic Window but Nanoscopic Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene supported on a substrate in contact with water underpins a wide range of processes and technologies, yet its wettability remains controversial. Understanding how substrate charges and graphene's properties influence water organization is crucial. Here, we combine heterodyne-detected sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate CaF$_2$-supported graphene interfaces in contact with water. We find that interfacial water orientation is primarily governed by the CaF$_2$ substrate's pH-dependent local electrostatics, confirming graphene's macroscopic wetting transparency. However, at the nanoscale, graphene's polarizability induces a local inversion of water's molecular orientation above substrate charges, revealing subtle structural ordering that is masked in spatially averaged measurements. These insights elucidate the molecular origins of graphene's wetting behavior and suggest new avenues to tailor interfacial phenomena in graphene-based nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Plausibility-Validity Gap by Fine-Tuning a Reasoning-Enhanced LLM for Chemical Synthesis and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models frequently generate outputs that appear scientifically reasonable yet violate fundamental principles--a phenomenon we characterize as the "plausibility-validity gap." This challenge proves especially acute in chemistry, where superficial correctness masks deeper errors in molecular structure, reaction mechanisms, and synthetic pathways. We present a systematic approach combining a reasoning-centric model architecture (Magistral Small) with Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dual-domain dataset covering molecular properties and chemical transformations. Evaluation reveals substantial improvements: the fine-tuned system achieves 96.3% format adherence, 97.4% chemical validity, and 74.4% synthesis feasibility. Comparative analysis shows our approach outperforms specialized translation models like MolT5 (97.4% vs 77.2% validity) while achieving performance comparable to complex tool-augmented systems like ChemCrow (9.0/10 vs 9.24/10 expert rating) through a more transparent, efficient methodology. Results demonstrate a learning hierarchy where syntactic correctness develops before chemical understanding, which precedes synthetic planning capability. This work establishes a reproducible framework for transforming generalist language models into dependable scientific tools while identifying critical areas including stereochemical precision, knowledge currency, and computational accessibility as key challenges for future advancement.</description>

      <title>Impact of Metal Cation on Chiral Properties of 2D Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are formed by embedding chiral organic cations in a perovskite crystal structure. The chirality arises from distortions of the 2D metal halide layers induced by the packing of these organic cations. Sn-based octahedra spontaneously distort, but it remains unclear whether this intrinsic structural instability enhances the chirality. We investigate the effect of the metal cation on structural and phonon chirality in MBA$_{2}$Sn$_{\mathrm{x}}$Pb$_{1-\mathrm{x}}$I$_{4}$ (x = 0, 1/2, and 1). Incorporating Sn does distort the metal halide octehedra, yet it only has a minor impact on the structural chirality. In contrast, the phonons in MBA$_{2}$SnI$_{4}$ are substantially more chiral than in MBA$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$, especially the in-plane acoustic modes. However, this enhanced phonon chirality does not lead to a generation of a larger angular momentum under a temperature gradient, because the contributions of different chiral phonons tend to compensate one another.</description>

      <title>Probing spin-motion coupling of two Rydberg atoms by a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol to measure the state-dependent motion of Rydberg atoms induced by dipole-dipole interactions. Our setup enables simultaneous readout of both the atomic internal state and position on a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. We benchmark the protocol using two atoms in the same Rydberg state, which experience van der Waals repulsion, and measure velocities in agreement with theoretical predictions. When preparing the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion coupling mediated by the interactions.</description>
