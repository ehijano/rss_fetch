      <title>Internet sentiment exacerbates intraday overtrading, evidence from A-Share market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market fluctuations caused by overtrading are important components of systemic market risk. This study examines the effect of investor sentiment on intraday overtrading activities in the Chinese A-share market. Employing high-frequency sentiment indices inferred from social media posts on the Eastmoney forum Guba, the research focuses on constituents of the CSI 300 and CSI 500 indices over a period from 01/01/2018, to 12/30/2022. The empirical analysis indicates that investor sentiment exerts a significantly positive impact on intraday overtrading, with the influence being more pronounced among institutional investors relative to individual traders. Moreover, sentiment-driven overtrading is found to be more prevalent during bull markets as opposed to bear markets. Additionally, the effect of sentiment on overtrading is observed to be more pronounced among individual investors in large-cap stocks compared to small- and mid-cap stocks.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous upper and lower bounds of American option prices with hedging via neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two methods to solve the American-style option pricing problem and its dual form at the same time using neural networks. Without applying nested Monte Carlo, the first method uses a series of neural networks to simultaneously compute both the lower and upper bounds of the option price, and the second one accomplishes the same goal with one global network. The avoidance of extra simulations and the use of neural networks significantly reduce the computational complexity and allow us to price Bermudan options with frequent exercise opportunities in high dimensions, as illustrated by the provided numerical experiments. As a by-product, these methods also derive a hedging strategy for the option, which can also be used as a control variate for variance reduction.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Process Based Method with Deep Kernel Learning for Pricing High-dimensional American Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel machine learning approach for pricing high-dimensional American options based on the modified Gaussian process regression (GPR). We incorporate deep kernel learning and sparse variational Gaussian processes to address the challenges traditionally associated with GPR. These challenges include its diminished reliability in high-dimensional scenarios and the excessive computational costs associated with processing extensive numbers of simulated paths Our findings indicate that the proposed method surpasses the performance of the least squares Monte Carlo method in high-dimensional scenarios, particularly when the underlying assets are modeled by Merton's jump diffusion model. Moreover, our approach does not exhibit a significant increase in computational time as the number of dimensions grows. Consequently, this method emerges as a potential tool for alleviating the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality.</description>
