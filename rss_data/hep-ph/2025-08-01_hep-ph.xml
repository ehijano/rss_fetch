      <title>Fant\^omas Unconfined: global QCD fits with B\'ezier parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fant\^omas is a C++ toolkit for exploring the parametrization dependence of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and other correlator functions in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Fant\^omas facilitates the generation of adaptable polynomial parametrizations for PDFs, called metamorphs, to find best-fit PDF solutions and quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with the parametrizations during their fitting. The method employs B\'ezier curves as universal approximators for a variety of PDF shapes. Integrated into the xFitter framework for the global QCD analysis, Fant\^omas provides a foundation for general models of PDFs, while reducing the computational time compared to the approaches utilizing traditional polynomial parametrizations as well as providing an interpretable alternative to neural-network-based models. This paper outlines the structure and practical usage of the Fant\^omas toolkit, including its inputs, outputs, and implementation within xFitter. It also provides a practical example of using Fant\^omas for uncertainty quantification as well as the combination of PDF fits into a single ensemble.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Rays and Gravitational Waves from Inelastic Higgs Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a simple and predictive dark matter scenario involving a complex scalar field, $\phi$, coupled to the Higgs portal with no additional field content. In the UV, the field possesses a global $U(1)$ symmetry which is broken by mass terms and Higgs portal interactions. In the mass basis, the complex field splits into a pair of real scalars with a small mass splitting (in analogy to pseudo-Dirac fermions), such that the Higgs portal acquires both diagonal and off-diagonal terms with respect to these eigenstates. In the parameter space where the off-diagonal interaction predominates, this scenario is safe from direct detection constraints. Moreover, this model provides a viable explanation for the longstanding Galactic Center gamma-ray excess. Additionally, this model influences the Higgs potential in a way that could facilitate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition in the early universe, potentially leading to a stochastic gravitational wave background that could fall within the reach of upcoming space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Charged Loops at the Cosmological Collider with Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological collider physics allows the detection of heavy particles at inflationary scales through their imprints on primordial non-Gaussianities. We study the chemical potential mechanism applied to a pair of charged scalars. We analytically evaluate the resulting one-loop contribution to the bispectrum, using the spectral decomposition. In this way we are able to determine the parametric dependences for both the signal and the background. We show that a signal strength $f_{\mathrm{NL}}\sim O(0.01)$ can be obtained within theoretical control, potentially reachable by 21cm tomography. As an application we consider the colored Higgs bosons in $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ supersymmetric orbifold grand unification with masses $M\lesssim10^{15}\:\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Hidden Sector Custodial Naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Custodial Naturalness is a recently introduced idea that combines conformal and scalar-sector custodial symmetry to address the electroweak (EW) scale hierarchy problem of the Standard Model (SM). We introduce a new model that realizes Custodial Naturalness without extension of the SM gauge group. The number of new dynamical degrees of freedom is minimized and the custodial symmetry is reduced to $\mathrm{SO}(5)$. This requires a new scalar singlet field that automatically is a good Dark Matter (DM) candidate, produced via freeze-in with moderate couplings. The most minimal scenario allows the quantum critical generation of the EW scale in a phenomenologically viable way requiring a UV completion at around $10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Including ingredients for neutrino mass generation can push this scale to $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$.</description>

      <title>An $N$-independent tensor decomposition for SU($N$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate a simultaneous treatment of an arbitrary number of colors in representation theory-based descriptions of QCD color structure, we derive an $N$-independent reduction of SU($N$) tensor products. To this end, we label each irreducible representation by a pair of Young diagrams, with parts acting on quarks and antiquarks. By combining this with a column-wise multiplication of Young diagrams, we generalize the Littlewood-Richardson rule for the product of two Young diagrams to the product of two Young diagram pairs, achieving a general-$N$ decomposition.</description>

      <title>When First Beats Fast: Early Neutrino-Mass-Driven Flavor Instabilities in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small flux of antineutrinos with the opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

      <title>Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.</description>

      <title>Studying Two-Photon Exchange in Deep Inelastic Scattering with the HERA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon exchange (TPE) is one of the leading explanations for discrepancies in measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. It has been proposed that TPE could impact not only elastic scattering, but also the cross sections for both inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS, thereby affecting the interpretation of DIS structure functions in terms of parton distributions. It is expected that higher-order QED effects such as TPE should manifest as a deviation from unity in the ratio of \epp and \emp DIS cross sections. We use the existing inclusive $e^{\pm}p$ DIS data from HERA and SLAC to constrain higher-order QED effects on inclusive DIS.</description>

      <title>Local spin polarization by color-field correlators and momentum anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local spin polarization of quarks induced by color-field correlators stemming from the correlation of chromo-Lorentz force and chromo-magnetic polarization or chromo-spin Hall effect in the presence of momentum anisotropy. Such effects can trigger longitudinal polarization from fluctuating color fields in glasma or quark gluon plasma phases with transverse expansion for relativistic heavy ion collisions. Especially, from the glasma effect, the resulting longitudinal polarization spectrum of $\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons has a sinusoidal structure with twice the azimuthal angle relative to the anisotropic direction. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the effect aligns with experimental observations. Our findings highlight the significant role of coherent gluon fields as a novel source for spin polarization phenomena in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Electric, thermal and thermoelectric response of a hot pion gas in a time dependent background magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prime focus of the work is to determine the electric, thermal and thermoelectric transport coefficients of a hot pion gas in the presence of time-dependent background magnetic fields. The thermoelectric effect is analyzed by examining the magneto-Seebeck and Nernst coefficients in the hot pionic medium under such conditions. Furthermore, the phenomenologically relevant elliptic flow coefficient, linked to the Knudsen number, is examined. The analysis reveals the significant impact of both the strength and time dependence of the magnetic field on the transport coefficients of the pionic medium. The results are analyzed in contrast to those obtained under a constant magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e covariant quantum molecular dynamics: a covariant description of a system of interacting wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new formulation for the mean-field propagation part of the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics, simulating an $N$-body system of interacting Gaussian wave packets via Lorentz scalar and vector potentials. Covariant equations of motion are derived based on the principle of least action. These covariant equations of motion can be solved with a computational cost comparable to that of conventional noncovariant quantum molecular dynamics. Furthermore, the new equations of motion accurately estimate the density-dependent potential, as demonstrated through comparison of the forces with the numerical integration. We apply them to $N$-body systems interacting via the Skyrme-type potentials or the relativistic mean field to simulate heavy-ion collisions. Our results show that the derived equations of motion provide a robust approximation to the dynamics of the full numerical integrations.</description>

      <title>Investigating jet induced identified hadron productions from the relative transverse activity classifier in pp collision at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the jet associated identified hadron productions of pions, kaons, and protons based on the event topological separation method in proton proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV employing the AMPT model with PYTHIA8 initial conditions. Enabling relative transverse event activity classifier $R_T$, we analyze the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra and particle ratios in the jet aligned toward region and the underlying event (UE) contributions sensitive transverse region varying with $R_T$. The results indicate that the AMPT model, incorporating both partonic and hadronic final-state interactions, provides a satisfactory description to the experimental data of the $p_T$ differential yields, particle ratios and average transverse momentum of identified particles in both the toward and transverse regions across different event activity classes. By subtracting the UE contribution from the toward region using the transverse region hadron yield, we introduce the in-jet hadron productions to analyze the modifications to jet itself. We find that the in-jet baryon to meson ratios reveal a sensitive dependence on $R_T$ driven by final state interactions, leading to a unique crossing pattern at intermediate $p_T$. This behavior can be regarded as a novel signature for probing jet medium interactions and energy loss effects in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Consistent $N_{\rm eff}$ fitting in big bang nucleosynthesis analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\rm eff}$, serves as a key fitting parameter extensively employed in cosmological studies. In this work, we point out a fundamental inconsistency in the conventional treatment of $N_{\rm eff}$ in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particularly regarding its applicability to new physics scenarios where $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, the deviation of $N_{\rm eff}$ from the standard BBN prediction, is negative. To ensure consistent interpretation, it is imperative to either restrict the allowed range of $N_{\rm eff}$ or systematically adjust neutrino-induced reaction rates based on physically motivated assumptions. As a concrete example, we consider a simple scenario in which a negative $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ arises from entropy injection into the electromagnetic sector due to the decay of long-lived particles after neutrino decoupling. This process dilutes the neutrino density and suppresses the rate of neutrino-driven neutron-proton conversion. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the resulting BBN constraints on $N_{\rm eff}$ deviate significantly from those obtained by the conventional, but unphysical, extrapolation of dark radiation scenarios into the $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0$ regime.</description>

      <title>TEEC and azimuthal correlations in forward {\gamma}-hadron production in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate photon-hadron Transverse Energy-Energy Correlation (TEEC) and azimuthal correlations in the forward rapidity region for proton-proton and proton-lead collisions within the small $x$ saturation formalism based on the Color Glass Condensate (CGC), supplemented by the initial-state and final-state parton shower simulation and hadronization using CASCADE. The study was performed in light of the upcoming FoCal detector of ALICE and the ATLAS detector upgrades with the extended pseudorapidity coverage. We predict a significant difference, at hadron-level, between the normalized TEECs in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions. Having a direct access to partonic subprocesses we also directly investigate the impact of the parton shower and hadronization on the TEEC. The ordinary azimuthal $\gamma$-hadron correlations show substantial suppression for proton-lead collision, as predicted earlier at parton-level.</description>

      <title>Factorization of multiparticle contributions to amplitudes of B-meson weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that multiparticle contributions to amplitudes of weak decays of the generic topology (heavy quark hits some intermediate point of the propagator line joining the end-points from which momenta $q$ and $q'$ are emitted) is given in the heavy quark limit by the convolution of (i) hard kernel composed of highly virtual propagators of light degrees of freedom and (ii) the $B$-meson multiparticle wave function, $\langle 0|\phi(x)\phi(x_1)\dots\phi(x_n)\phi_b(0)\phi(x'_{n'})\dots\phi(x'_1)\phi(x')|B(p)\rangle$, in a double-collinear light-cone configuration: the coordinates $x,x_1,...,x_n$ are ordered and aligned along the light-like 4-vector $a_\mu$, $a^2=0$, $q_\mu\propto a_\mu$, while the coordinates $x',x_1',...,x'_{n'}$ are ordered and aligned along the light-like 4-vector $a'_\mu$, $a'^2=0$, $q'_\mu\propto a'_\mu$, $a'a\ne 0$. Corrections to this factorization formula are suppressed by powers of $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_b$.</description>

      <title>Revealing chiral-odd two-meson generalized distribution amplitudes in $e^- e^+ \to (\pi \pi) (\pi \pi)$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral-odd dimeson generalized distribution amplitudes (CO-GDAs)-nonperturbative objects encoding the transition of a quark-antiquark pair into two mesons-can be accessed in high-energy $e^- e^+$ annihilation into two meson pairs, each with a relatively low invariant mass. While chiral-even GDAs contribute to the leading one-photon amplitude, the chiral-odd sector enters via two-photon exchange. We show that the interference between these amplitudes leads to measurable effects at BES III or future tau-charm factories. This work opens a direct path to experimentally probing the long-missing chiral-odd sector of meson structure-specifically, the anomalous tensorial magnetic moment of spin-zero mesons such as the pion.</description>

      <title>Subthreshold parameters of $\pi\pi$ scattering revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the most recent experimental data and lattice QCD calculations of $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths, while employing dispersive representations of the amplitude based on Roy equations, we compute the subthreshold parameters of this process. We use Monte Carlo sampling to numerically model the probability distribution of the results based on all uncertainties in the inputs. We also investigate the dependence of the results on a theoretical correlation between the $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths $a^0_0$ and $a^2_0$, which was previously established in the framework of two-flavour chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ in the improved perturbative QCD formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of fragmented scalar glueball, we investigate the decays $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ within the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) framework by including the known next-to-leading order corrections. Here, $B^0$ and $f_0$ denote the neutral $B_{d,s}^0$ mesons and the light scalar mesons $f_0(500, 980, 1370, 1500)$ under the $q\bar q$ assignment. The {\it CP}-averaged branching ratios (BRs) and the {\it CP} asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ are evaluated with the $f_0(500)[f_0(1370)]-f_0(980)[f_0(1500)]$ mixing in quark-flavor basis. For effective comparisons with the near-future measurements, we further derive the $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0 (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ BRs under the narrow-width approximation. ${\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-))= (2.87^{+1.38}_{-1.29}) \times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the iPQCD formalism agrees with the available measurements and predictions within uncertainties. Large BRs of $B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1500) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ and large direct {\it CP} asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1370, 1500)$ are accessible in the LHCb and Belle-II experiments. The experimental tests of these iPQCD predictions would help us to understand the nature of these light scalars more deeply and provide evidences to decipher $f_0(1500)$ as a primary or fragmented scalar glueball potentially.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Couplings from the Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian for Off-Shell Higgs in $gg\to Z_L Z_L$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of (longitudinal) $Z$-boson pairs in gluon fusion as a probe of anomalous Higgs couplings. Of particular interest is the kinematic region of large center-of-mass energy, where the Higgs-boson is highly off-shell. We employ the electroweak chiral Lagrangian with a light Higgs, which is the most natural effective field theory (EFT) for this process. We demonstrate this by a detailed analysis of the leading and next-to-leading EFT contributions to the amplitude, at leading order in QCD, emphasizing the role of power counting for a systematic application of the EFT. We show that at leading order the new-physics contributions are described by only two parameters, which depend on three EFT couplings. Subleading effects can be expected to be small within the range of validity of the EFT. Phenomenological implications are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Chirality structure of vector like new physics operators in charged current transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cascade decay $B^{*0}_{s} \rightarrow D_s^-(\rightarrow \tau^-\,\bar\nu_{\tau})\,\ell^{+}\,{\nu}_\ell$ induced by flavor changing charged currents in the context of the Standard Model and in vector-like couplings beyond the Standard Model. We employ the helicity amplitude formalism for analysis and highlight the role of new vector-like couplings in charged current interactions. We find, in particular, that while new left handed chiral-vector like interactions contribute to the branching ratio, they do not affect the forward-backward asymmetry, or the angular observables. On the other hand, the right handed chiral vector-like coupling in the case of this decay contributes to the branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry and the angular observables. We confirm that this difference in behavior between the left and right handed NP couplings is a general feature of charged current processes with a vector meson going to a pseudoscalar at the tree level in effective weak theory by cross checking with the cascade decays $B^{*+}_c \rightarrow P(\rightarrow P'\,\mu^+\,\nu_{\mu})\,\ell^{+}\,{\nu}_\ell$ where $P$ is $B_s^0$ ($D^0$) and $P'$ is $D_s^{*-}$ ($K^-$).</description>

      <title>Updated Constraints from Electric Dipole Moments in the MSSM with R-Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of quarks and leptons in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with trilinear $R$-parity violation (RPV). In this framework, EDMs are induced at the two-loop level via RPV interactions. We perform a comprehensive recalculation of several classes of Barr-Zee type diagrams in a general $R_\xi$ gauge. While we find general agreement with previous analytic results in the literature, our work provides a valuable independent cross-check of the complicated calculations. We also point out some subtleties in the intermediate steps and in the choice of the flavor basis for the numerical evaluation of the expressions. By confronting the theoretical predictions with the latest experimental limits on EDMs, we derive updated constraints on combinations of RPV couplings. We highlight a sharp, testable correlation between the proton and neutron EDM that emerges within the considered class of RPV models, offering a distinctive signature for future EDM experiments.</description>

      <title>Features of Charged Lepton Flavor Violation in an $A_4$ Symmetric Neutrino Mass Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino flavour oscillations imply that there must be charged lepton flavour violation (CLFV) also. Different neutrino mass models predict different patterns of CLFV decays. Neutrino mass generation through standard see-saw mechanisms leads to the prediction that the branching ratios of meson CLFV decays will always be smaller than the corresponding radiative CLFV decays. In this work, we analyse an interesting neutrino mass model, based on $A_4$ symmetry, in which the symmetry and the symmetry-breaking pattern lead the neutrino mixing matrix to be of tri-bimaximal (TBM) form. In this model, we find that the meson CLFV decay amplitudes are not correlated to the corresponding radiative CLFV amplitudes, unlike in the case of see-saw models. The branching ratios of radiative CLFV decays are predicted to be negligibly small in this model, but those of the meson CLFV decays can be large enough to be observable in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the confining pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14426v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for obtaining unified radial distributions of dark matter properties for different galaxies independent of their mass, type, or size. The publicly available measurements of 2693 stellar objects of 153 different galaxies of the SPARC-group [3] are used to demonstrate the effectivity of the method. The obtained unified radial distributions of dark matter properties like velocity, acceleration, mass and mass density give a detailed understanding of the general dark matter behavior within in the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Heavy flavored hydrogen molecule systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of $S$-wave exotic hydrogen-like three-body systems ($pp\mu^-$, $pp\tau^-$, $\mu^-\mu^-p$, $\tau^-\tau^-p$, $p\mu^-\tau^-$) with spin-parity $J^P = 1/2^+$ and $3/2^+$, and four-body systems ($pp\mu^-\mu^-$, $pp\tau^-\tau^-$) with $J^P = 0^+$, $1^+$, and $2^+$. We use complex scaling and Gaussian expansion methods to solve the complex-scaled Schr\"{o}dinger equation and obtain possible bound and quasi-bound states. The resulting binding energies range from $-33.8$~keV to $-340$~eV. Notably, we present the first theoretical estimation of the bound-state energy levels of $pp\mu^-\mu^-$ and $pp\tau^-\tau^-$, which is of significant importance for understanding exotic few-body Coulomb systems. We further analyze spin configurations and root-mean-square radii to elucidate the spatial structure of these bound and quasi-bound states. Our results reveal that $K$-type spatial configurations play a crucial role in accurately describing bound and quasi-bound states in the hydrogen-molecule-like systems $pp\mu^-\mu^-$ and $pp\tau^-\tau^-$. Incorporating $K$-type configurations significantly alters the mass spectra of these states. Future muon colliders and muon facilities may offer promising platforms for the possible copious production of such heavy flavored hydrogen molecules and molecular ions. For instance, scattering processes such as $2\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2} \to \mathrm{H_{2\mu}} + 2e^-$, $\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2} \to \mathrm{H_{\mu e}} + e^-$, and $\mu^- + \mathrm{H_2^+} \to \mathrm{H_{2\mu}^+} + e^-$ could be utilized, facilitating detailed studies of intriguing states such as $\mathrm{H_{2\mu}}$, $\mathrm{H_{\mu e}}$, and $\mathrm{H_{2\mu}^+}$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Spherically Symmetric Causal Diamond in Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute a gravitational on-shell action of a finite, spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, finding it is proportional to the area of the bifurcate horizon $A_{\mathcal{B}}$. We then identify the on-shell action with the saddle point of the Euclidean gravitational path integral, which is naturally interpreted as a partition function. This partition function is thermal with respect to a modular Hamiltonian $K$. Consequently, we determine, from the on-shell action using standard thermodynamic identities, both the mean and variance of the modular Hamiltonian, finding $\langle K \rangle = \langle (\Delta K)^2 \rangle = \frac{A_{\mathcal{B}}}{4 G_N}$. Finally, we show that modular fluctuations give rise to fluctuations in the geometry, and compute the associated phase shift of massless particles traversing the diamond under such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>From confinement to chaos in AdS/CFT correspondence via non-equilibrium local states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to operator quenches for free fields in AdS. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff, creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators the fluctuations approach quite close those of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Finally, we extend our analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and its hard wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar behavior.</description>

      <title>Three-loop banana integrals with four unequal masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a system of canonical differential equations satisfied by the three-loop banana integrals with four distinct non-zero masses in $D = 2-2\eps$ dimensions. Together with the initial condition in the small-mass limit, this provides all the ingredients to find analytic results for three-loop banana integrals in terms of iterated integrals to any desired order in the dimensional regulator. To obtain this result, we rely on recent advances in understanding the K3 geometry underlying these integrals and in how to construct rotations to an $\eps$-factorized basis. This rotation typically involves the introduction of objects defined as integrals of (derivatives of) K3 periods and rational functions. We apply and extend a method based on results from twisted cohomology to identify relations among these functions, which allows us to reduce their number considerably. We expect that the methods that we have applied here will prove useful to compute further multiloop multiscale Feynman integrals attached to non-trivial geometries.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in Palatini gravity for a non-minimal geometry-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. The singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous publication. Since new phases violate the projectile-target symmetry the model is found non-physical for the bare intercepts above their critical value.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of parton cascade in solving the relativistic Boltzmann equation in a box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We benchmark the ZPC parton cascade with an exact analytical solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous and massless gas with a constant and isotropic elastic cross section. We measure the accuracy of ZPC with the relative mean deviation between its momentum distribution and the exact solution. We use two generalized collision schemes to further improve the accuracy of ZPC over the recent $t$-minimum collision scheme. We find that ZPC can reproduce very well the time evolution of the single-particle distribution function for the exact solution's initial condition, with one generalized collision scheme giving an accuracy better than $1\%$ for the momentum distribution at any time in all studied cases, including very high opacities where naively the parton cascade approach is expected to fail.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference for Precision Neutrino Physics through Neural Monte Carlo tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.</description>

      <title>Inflation models selected by the swampland distance conjecture with the Lyth bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Ray Composition and Muon-philic Dark Matter via Muon Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel cosmic-ray scattering experiment employing a Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) muon tomography system. By introducing the scattering angle between incident and outgoing cosmic-ray tracks as a key observable, this approach enables simultaneous studies of secondary cosmic-ray composition and searching for new physics. During a 63-day campaign, 1.18 million cosmic ray scattering events were recorded and analyzed. By performing combined template fits to the observed angular distribution, particle abundances are measured, for example, resolving the electron component at $\sim 2\%$ precision. Furthermore, constraints are established on elastic muon-dark matter (DM) scattering cross-sections for muon-philic dark matter. At the 95\% confidence level, the limit reaches 1.62 $\times$ $10^{-17}$ $\rm{cm}^{2}$ for 1 GeV slow DM, demonstrating sensitivity limit to light muon-coupled slow DM.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation of Neutron Star Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) from astrophysical observations of masses, radii and tidal deformabilities, using Neural posterior estimation (NPE) with Conditional Normalising Flows (CNF). To ensure that the model conforms with reality, physics-informed constraints are embedded directly into the training loss. This enables efficient, likelihood-free inference of full posterior distributions for key thermodynamic quantities-including pressure, squared speed of sound, and the trace anomaly-conditioned on observational data. Our models are trained on synthetic datasets generated from two agnostic EoS priors: polytropic parametrizations (PT) and gaussian process (GP) reconstructions. These datasets span various scenarios, including the presence or absence of tidal deformability information and observational noise. Across all settings, the method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors, with uncertainties reduced when tidal deformability constraints are included. Furthermore, we find that the behavior of normalized predictive dispersions is strongly correlated with the maximum central density inside NSs, suggesting that the model can indirectly infer this physically meaningful quantity. The approach generalizes well across EoS families and accurately reconstructs derivative quantities such as the polytropic index, demonstrating its robustness and potential for probing dense matter in NS cores.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced dark matter detection using Schr\"odinger cat states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitive dark matter detection, particularly using nonclassical states, such as Schr\"odinger cat states featuring sub-Planck interference structures in microwave cavities. Here, we report the first experimental application of four-component Schr\"odinger cat states within a high-quality superconducting microwave cavity to detect dark photons, a potential dark matter candidate. We demonstrate an 8.1-fold enhancement in the signal photon rate and constrain the dark photon kinetic mixing angle to an unprecedented $\epsilon &lt; 7.32 \times 10^{-16}$ near 6.44~GHz (26.6~$\mu$eV). By employing a parametric sideband drive to actively tune the cavity frequency, we achieve dark photon searches and background subtraction across multiple frequency bins, yielding a sensitivity at the $10^{-16}$ level within a 100~kHz bandwidth. Our Schr\"odinger's cat-assisted detection (SCaD) scheme demonstrates a substantial improvement over previous results, promising potential implications in quantum-enhanced searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Jet substructure measurements elucidating partonic evolution in $p$+$p$ collisions at RHIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets are multiscale objects that connect partons to hadrons, making jet substructure measurements crucial for probing both perturbative and non-perturbative processes in QCD. At STAR, a variety of jet substructure observables, such as SoftDrop groomed splittings and N-Point Energy Correlators (ENC), provide insights into parton evolution and hadronization mechanisms. SoftDrop-groomed observables and ENCs both connect measurement to fundamental QCD at the parton level, allowing for comparisons to first-principles theoretical calculations. Additionally, by also including charge information, as in the charge-weighted ENC, details about the hadronization mechanism can be obtained. In these proceedings, we present preliminary results on measurements of SoftDrop observables and ENCs across different jet momenta and radii in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$~=~200~GeV using STAR data.</description>

      <title>Inelastic heavy quarkonium photoproduction in $p$-$p$ and $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions at LHC energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inelastic charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon(nS)$) photoproduction and fragmentation processes in $p$-$p$ and $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions at LHC energies, where the ultra-incoherent photon emission is included. In the framework of the NRQCD factorization approach, an exact treatment is developed which recovers Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams approximation (WWA) near the region $Q^{2}\sim0$, where the methods of Martin-Ryskin and BCCKL are used to avoid double counting. We calculate the $Q^{2}$, $y$, $z$, $\sqrt{s}$, $p_{T}$ dependent and the total cross sections. It turns out that the inelastic photoproduction and fragmentation processes provide valuable contributions to the heavy quarkonium production, especially in the large $p_{T}$ regions. While the relative contribution of ultra-incoherent photon channel is very important, which rapidly increases along with the growing quarkonium mass, and begins to dominate the photoproduction processes at large $p_{T}$ ranges. Moreover, we obtain the complete validity scopes of WWA in inelastic heavy quarkonium photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions. WWA has a much higher accuracy at high energies and in $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions. The existing photon spectra are generally derived beyond the applicable scopes of WWA, and the double counting exists when the different channels are considered simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Two Types of Gluons in QCD: Re-interpretation of ALEPH and CMS Gluon Jet Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Abelian decomposition of QCD tells that there are two types of gluons in QCD, the color neutral neurons and colored chromons, which behave differently. This strongly implies that QCD has two types of gluon jets, the neuron jet and chromon jet. One quarter of the gluon jets is made of the neuron jets which have sharper jet radius and smaller particle multiplicity, while three quarters of them are made of chromon jets which have the broader jet radius and larger particle multiplicity. Moreover, the neuron jet has a distinct color flow which forms an ideal color dipole pattern, while the chromon jets have distorted dipole pattern. In this paper we provide five circumferential evidences of the existence of two types of gluon jets from the existing ALEPH and DELPHI data on $e \bar e \rightarrow Z \rightarrow b \bar b g$ decay and the CMS data on Pb-Pb heavy ion collision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a hadronic de-excitation mechanism via lepton flavor violation (LFV). Namely, for vector and pseudoscalar meson decays of the form $V^\prime \to V \mu e$ and $P^\prime \to P \mu e$, respectively. They are described considering effective dim-5 and dim-7 operators. Using the current bounds for the effective couplings obtained from direct processes, we exhibit the different features in the dilepton invariant mass distribution and the branching ratios, depending on the effective operator. We consider hadronic states, from light mesons to quarkonia. We show that the branching ratios of quarkonia system for LFV are comparable with the estimates in other hadronic systems. Our results show that the dilepton invariant mass may be useful to constrain individual contributions and help disentangle them, when complemented with observables from nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a rigorous analysis of the $\pi K$ scattering at an unphysical pion mass 391 MeV using the Roy-Steiner equations, which satisfy unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry, for the first time. Stable solutions of the Roy-Steiner equations with different quantum numbers of isospin and angular momentum are obtained in the elastic energy region, by taking inputs from the $\pi K$ lattice data in the inelastic region, the lattice data from the crossed $\pi\pi \to K\bar{K}$ channels, the masses of $f_0(500)$ and $K^*$ at the same pion mass from previous study, and the Regge model. Predictions on the elastic $\pi K$ scattering phase shifts and the $K_0^*(700)$ pole content are made. Contrary to the virtual pole scenario obtained using the $K$-matrix method in the literature, we find that lightest strange scalar meson $K_0^*(700)$ remains a broad resonance at $m_\pi=391$ MeV. The cross-channel dynamics is found to play a crucial role in deriving the proper pole position.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Heavy Quarks in Strongly Coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the probability distribution $P({\bf k})$ for a heavy quark with velocity $v$ propagating through strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma in the 't Hooft limit at a temperature $T$ to acquire a momentum ${\bf k}$ due to interactions with the plasma. This distribution encodes the well-known drag coefficient $\eta_D$ and the transverse and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Furthermore, our calculation determines all of the higher order and mixed moments to leading order in $1/\sqrt{\lambda}$ for the first time. These non-Gaussian features of $P({\bf k})$ include qualitatively novel correlations between longitudinal energy loss and transverse momentum broadening at nonzero $v$. We demonstrate that these non-Gaussian characteristics can be sizable in magnitude and even dominant in physically relevant situations. We use these results to derive a Kolmogorov equation for the evolution of the probability distribution for the total momentum of a heavy quark that propagates through strongly coupled plasma. This evolution equation accounts for all higher order correlations between transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal energy loss, which we have calculated from first principles. It reduces to a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation when truncated to only include the effects of $\eta_D$, $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Remarkably, while heavy quarks do not reach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma if evolved with this FP equation, we demonstrate that heavy quarks do reach kinetic equilibrium if evolved with the all-order Kolmogorov equation we have derived. Our results thus provide a dynamically complete framework for understanding the thermalization of a heavy quark that may be initially far from equilibrium in the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma -- as well as new insight into heavy quark transport and equilibration in quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of 95 GeV Excess within the Georgi-Machacek Model in Light of Positive Definiteness Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observation of a di-photon excess around 95 GeV by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations, along with the $b\bar{b}$ excess reported by the LEP Collaboration in the same mass region, has drawn significant interest in the possibility of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, which extends the Higgs sector of the SM by introducing additional triplet scalars while preserving custodial symmetry at tree level, provides a compelling framework to explain both excesses simultaneously via a light custodial singlet Higgs. In this work, we investigate whether the GM model can still accommodate these excesses when taking into account newly proposed vacuum stability constraints, particularly the positive definiteness conditions. Our numerical analysis not only confirms the existence of a viable parameter space capable of explaining the 95 GeV excesses, but also demonstrates that, compared to traditional tree-level constraints at the electroweak scale, the positive definiteness conditions further expand the allowed parameter space, thereby enhancing the viability of the GM model. Furthermore, we emphasize that future collider experiments will play a crucial role in testing this interpretation by refining Higgs coupling measurements and searching for additional Higgs bosons.</description>

Abstract: A neutrino factory is a potential successor to the upcoming generation of neutrino oscillation experiments and a possible precursor to next-generation muon colliders. Such a machine would provide a well-characterized beam of $\nu_\mu$, $\bar\nu_\mu$, $\nu_e$, and $\bar\nu_e$ neutrinos with comparable statistics. Here we show the sensitivity of a neutrino factory to new oscillation physics scenarios such as vector neutrino non-standard interactions and CPT violation. We study two different potential setups for a neutrino factory with different assumptions on charge identification in the far detector. We find that 10 years of a neutrino factory combined with 10 years of DUNE can improve over most of the current constraints on these scenarios and even over forecasted constraints by 20 years of DUNE. Additionally, we find that a neutrino factory can break degeneracies between the standard oscillation parameters and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters present at DUNE.</description>

      <title>On the Simulation of Hidden Parton Showers in the Conformal Window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider confining Hidden Valley/Dark Sector theories containing many dark quark flavors. These theories are in the ``conformal window'': they reach an infrared fixed point when their quarks are massless, and have unfamiliar confinement when the quark masses are non-zero but small. Their jets of hidden hadrons may be quite different from those familiar from QCD, but their details cannot currently be simulated even qualitatively. This is partly due to the use of approximations to the two-loop running coupling in existing event generators' parton showers, which are not broadly applicable across the conformal window. We argue that the exact two-loop running coupling, and a corresponding Sudakov factor employing that coupling, must be implemented in simulation packages in order to allow phenomenological studies of these theories.</description>

      <title>Triplet fermion WIMP dark matter in the general supersymmetric Georgi-Machacek model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supersymmetric custodial triplet model (SCTM), which is a fully-super\-symmetric generalization of the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, is constructed by extending the Higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model by three triplet chiral superfields with hypercharge $Y=0,\pm 1$, in order to maintain the holomorphy of the superpotential and satisfy the requirements of anomaly cancellation. The global $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetry has to be respected for the superpotential and soft supersymmetry breaking sector, where the former will only be broken by the Yukawa couplings and the latter one will be broken spontaneously to the custodial $SU(2)_V$ symmetry after electroweak symmetry breaking similar as the GM model. The ensuing complicated spectrum not only gives rich collider phenomenology but also provides more available Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) Dark Matter (DM) candidates. In this paper, we explore the viability of WIMP solutions for DM in the SCTM, by considering the increasingly stringent constraints from direct detection DM experiments. Our numerical simulations show that a significant portion of the SCTM parameter space remains viable despite these constraints and will be fully tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Properties of solutions by the Schwinger-Dyson equation at finite temperature and density : A four-fermion interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the properties of the solutions obtained by the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE).
  As a simple example, we consider a two-dimensional model including four-fermion interaction. It is shown that when this model is solved by an iterative method using the SDE at finite density, multiple solutions depending on the initial input values are obtained.
  We investigate the reasons for this situation by examining the convergence of the solutions obtained by iterative method. We also consider the solution of the SDE using alternative methods. Furthermore, we compare these results with analytical solutions at zero temperature and discuss the relation with the behavior of the effective potential. We extend these considerations to finite temperatures.
  Based on these analyses, we consider ways to avoid spurious solutions that appear in the iterative method.</description>

      <title>Conformal Phase Transition in Supersymmetric QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional supersymmetric QCD in conformal window with a marginally relevant deformation which triggers the spontaneous breaking of (approximate) scale invariance and the subsequent confinement, generating a mass gap, at an energy scale hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale without fine-tuning. We analyze the finite temperature system and show that the phase transition associated with the breaking of conformal invariance is of the strong first order. When such a phase transition takes place at a temperature of the Universe around the electroweak scale, it generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background probed by future space-based interferometers, while a conformal phase transition in a dark sector at $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV generates GWs to explain the reported pulsar timing array signal.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin polarization as a novel probe of medium-induced transverse-momentum-broadening effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons within unpolarized jets originates from the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) fragmentation function $D_{1T}^\perp (z, p_T, \mu^2)$. In the vacuum environment, the QCD evolution of this TMD fragmentation function is governed by the Collins-Soper equation. However, in the presence of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium, the jet-medium interaction induces a transverse-momentum-broadening effect that modifies the QCD evolution. As a result, the transverse spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions differs from that in $pp$ collisions. We demonstrate that this difference serves as a sensitive probe for studying jet-medium interaction, offering a novel perspective through the spin degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for type II seesaw model --symmetric phase v.s. broken phase--</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective field theory is an effective approach to parameterizing effects of high energy scale physics in low energy measurements. The two popular frameworks for physics beyond the standard model are the so-called standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs effective field theory (HEFT). While the description by the SMEFT deteriorates when the scale of new physics is not so high or it participates in spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, the HEFT makes use of nonlinear realization of spontaneously broken symmetry in which there are practically no restrictions on the Higgs field as a singlet. In this work we present another framework, called broken phase effective field theory (bEFT), in which we deal directly with mass eigenstate fields after spontaneous symmetry breaking without employing nonlinear realization. We take the type-II seesaw model as an example to demonstrate our approach. By matching the model to both the bEFT and the SMEFT at tree level, we compare the results for two processes, the Higgs pair production via vector boson fusion which appears as a subprocess at the LHC and the Higgs-strahlung process at a future electron-positron collider. We find that the bEFT reproduces the type-II seesaw model more accurately than the SMEFT in the regions where the bare mass of the Higgs triplet becomes close to the electroweak scale. Therefore, the bEFT serves as a useful framework that can compensate for the shortcomings in both the SMEFT and the HEFT when dealing with UV models that involve Higgs mixing or new particles with a mass close to the electroweak scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of heavy new particles beyond the Standard Model can be conveniently captured through higher-dimensional effective operators. As noted long ago by Weinberg, the amount of baryon and lepton number an operator can carry is intricately connected to its mass dimension. We derive an improved inequality for this connection and compare it to explicit operator constructions up to mass dimension 25. For the effective field theory of Standard Model plus right-handed neutrinos, our relationship is even an equality up to high mass dimension.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Beyond leading twist: $\rho$ meson decay constants and distribution amplitudes in a self-consistent light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of decay constants and chiral-even and chiral-odd distribution amplitudes (DAs) up to twist 4 for the $\rho$ meson in the standard light-front quark model (LFQM) based on the Bakamjian-Thomas (BT) construction. For the $\rho$ meson, which possesses both longitudinal $(h=0)$ and transverse $(h=\pm 1)$ polarizations, two types of decay constants, $f_{\rho}^{\parallel}$ and $f_{\rho}^{\perp}$, arises accordingly. We demonstrate that these decay constants can be self-consistently extracted from both local ($z^\mu=0$) and nonlocal ($z^\mu\neq 0$) matrix elements $\langle 0 | \bar{q}(z)\, \Gamma\, q(-z) | \rho(P,h) \rangle$, with $\Gamma = (\gamma^\mu, \sigma^{\mu\nu}, \gamma^\mu\gamma_5, \mathbf{1})$, in a manner independent of current components, polarizations, and reference frames. In particular, we emphasize the role of nonlocal matrix elements involving axial-vector and scalar currents, where mixing between $f_\rho^{\parallel}$ and $f_\rho^{\perp}$ occurs. We show that this mixing is consistently resolved through the BT construction, ensuring the proper extraction of these decay constants. Additionally, we investigate the structure of chiral-even DAs ($\phi_{2;\mathrm{V}}^\parallel, \phi_{3;\mathrm{V}}^\parallel, \psi_{3;\mathrm{A}}^\perp, \phi_{4;\mathrm{V}}^\parallel$) and chiral-odd DAs ($\phi_{2;\mathrm{T}}^\perp, \phi_{3;\mathrm{T}}^\perp, \psi_{3;\mathrm{S}}^\parallel, \phi_{4;\mathrm{T}}^\perp$) beyond leading twists, and present their corresponding $\xi$-moments and Gegenbauer moments. These results provide deeper insight into the nonperturbative structure of vector mesons and demonstrate the robustness and self-consistency of the LFQM based on the BT framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of $\pi K\rightarrow \pi K$ and $\pi\pi\rightarrow K\bar K$ amplitudes at large unphysical pion mass for all important partial waves is presented. A set of crossing-symmetric partial-wave hyperbolic dispersion relations is used to describe lattice QCD data at $m_\pi=391$ MeV. In the present analysis, the amplitudes for the $S$- and $P$-waves are formulated by combining the constraints of analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry, fulfilling Roy-Steiner-type equations. We use these results to investigate the low-lying strange-meson resonances and resolve the instability problem tied to analytic continuation in prior lattice QCD studies based on the $K$-matrix formalism. At $m_\pi=391$ MeV, the rigorous Roy-Steiner-type equation approach allows us to determine the $S$-wave scattering lengths, $m_\pi a_0^{1/2}=\left(0.92_{-0.28}^{+0.06}\right)$, $m_\pi a_0^{3/2}=-\left(0.32_{-0.02}^{+0.05}\right)$, and the $\kappa$ (also known as $K_0^*(700)$) pole position, $\sqrt{s_\kappa}=\left(966_{-24}^{+41}-i 198_{-17}^{+38}\right)$ MeV. We also provide a detailed analysis of the complex validity domain of the Roy-Steiner-type equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles formalism, based on the transport equation in the line-of-sight approximation, to link the expected number of muons at neutrino telescopes to the flux of neutrinos at the Earth's surface. We compute the distribution of muons inside Earth, arising from the up-scattering of neutrinos close to the detector, as well as from the decay of taus produced farther away. This framework allows one to account for systematic uncertainties, as well as to clarify the assumptions behind definitions commonly used in the literature, such as the effective area. We apply this formalism to analyze the high-energy muon event recorded by KM3NeT, with a reconstructed energy of $ 120^{+110}_{-60} \, \mathrm{PeV}$ and an elevation angle of $\left(0.54\pm 2.4\right)^\circ$, in comparison with the non-observation of similar events by IceCube. We find a $3.1\,\sigma$ tension between the two experiments, assuming a diffuse neutrino source with a power-law energy dependence. Combining both datasets leads to a preference for a very low number of expected events at KM3NeT, in stark contrast to the observed data. The tension increases both in the case of a diffuse source peaking at the KM3NeT energy and of a steady point source, whereas a transient source may reduce the tension down to $1.6\,\sigma$. The formalism allows one to treat potential beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of muons, and we speculate on this possibility to explain the tension.</description>

      <title>A critical appraisal of tests of locality and of entanglement versus non-entanglement at colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued more than 30 years ago that it is not possible to test locality at colliders, due to the inability to directly measure non-commutating observables such as spin components in current collider experiments. Recently, there has been a lot of phenomenological and experimental activity around testing locality via Bell-type experiments or entanglement versus non-entanglement in a collider environment. These results seem to evade the earlier no-go theorem by indirectly measuring spin correlations via their relation to angular correlations between momenta. We perform a careful study of the feasibility of such an approach. We scrutinize the relationship between spin and angular correlations in both quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories. Our conclusion is that it is currently not possible to perform a logically coherent set of experimental measurements at colliders that would allow one to test locality or entanglement versus non-entanglement. This reaffirms the earlier no-go theorem. We stress that the no-go theorem does not apply to measurements of observables inspired from entanglement and Quantum Information Theory to test the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CUDACPP plugin for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO aims to accelerate leading order tree-level event generation by providing the MadEvent event generator with data-parallel helicity amplitudes. These amplitudes are written in templated C++ and CUDA, allowing them to be compiled for CPUs supporting SSE4, AVX2, and AVX-512 instruction sets as well as CUDA- and HIP-enabled GPUs. Using SIMD instruction sets, CUDACPP-generated amplitude routines routines are shown to speed up linearly with SIMD register size, and GPU offloading is shown to provide acceleration beyond that of SIMD instructions. Additionally, the resulting speed-up in event generation perfectly aligns with predictions from measured runtime fractions spent in amplitude routines, and proper GPU utilisation can speed up high-multiplicity QCD processes by an order of magnitude when compared to optimal CPU usage in server-grade CPUs.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Molecules and $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ Coupled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm exotic mesons based on a coupled-channel framework, where the physical states are described as superpositions of a compact $c\bar c$ core (identified with the $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ states) and hadronic components such as $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$. We incorporate meson exchange potentials to describe hadron-hadron interactions and determine model parameters to reproduce the observed masses of $X(3872)$ and $Z(3930)$. The model also predicts a $0^{++}$ bound state consistent with the $X(3860)$. The internal structure is found to be predominantly molecular for the $X(3872)$, while the $X(3860)$ and $Z(3930)$ have larger $c\bar{c}$ components. The coupling between $c\bar{c}$ cores and hadronic components plays a crucial role in generating these states. The resulting wave functions provide insight into the internal structure and decay properties of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Detecting LHC Neutrinos at Surface Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first direct detection of neutrinos at the LHC not only marks the beginning of a novel collider neutrino program at CERN but also motivates considering additional neutrino detectors to fully exploit the associated physics potential. We investigate the feasibility and physics potential of neutrino experiments located at the surface-level. A topographic desk study was performed to identify all points at which the LHC's neutrino beams exit the earth. The closest location lies about 9 km east of the CMS interaction point, at the bottom of Lake Geneva. Several detectors to be placed at this location are considered, including a water Cherenkov detector and an emulsion detector. The detector concepts are introduced, and projections for their contribution to the LHC forward neutrino program and searches for dark sector particles are presented. However, the dilution of the neutrino flux over distance reduces the neutrino yield significantly, limiting the physics potential of surface-level detectors compared to ones closer to the interaction point, including the proposed FPF.</description>

      <title>Synaptic Field Theory for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08827</link>

Abstract: Theoretical understanding of deep learning remains elusive despite its empirical success. In this study, we propose a novel "synaptic field theory" that describes the training dynamics of synaptic weights and biases in the continuum limit. Unlike previous approaches, our framework treats synaptic weights and biases as fields and interprets their indices as spatial coordinates, with the training data acting as external sources. This perspective offers new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of deep learning and suggests a pathway for leveraging well-established field-theoretic techniques to study neural network training.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04382</link>

Abstract: Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON's deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.</description>
