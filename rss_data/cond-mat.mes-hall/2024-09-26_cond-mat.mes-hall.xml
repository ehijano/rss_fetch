      <title>Squeezing Quantum States in Three-Dimensional Twisted Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental idea in wave mechanics is that propagation in a periodic medium can be described by Bloch waves whose conserved crystal momenta define their transformations when displaced by the set of discrete lattice translations. In ordered materials where incommensurate spatial periods compete, this general principle is rendered ineffective, often with dramatic consequences. Examples are crystals with broken symmetries from charge or spin density waves, quasiperiodic lattices that produce diffraction patterns with crystallographically forbidden point symmetries, and stacks of two-dimensional lattices with a relative rotation (twist) between layers. In special cases when there is a small difference between the competing periods, a useful work-around is a continuum description where a periodic long-wavelength field produces Bragg scattering that coherently mixes short-wavelength carrier waves. In this work, we advocate an alternative approach to study three-dimensional twisted crystals that replaces their spectrally congested momentum-space Bloch band structures with a representation using squeezed coherent states in a Fock space of free-particle vortex states. This reorganization of the Hilbert space highlights the crucial role of the Coriolis force in the equations of motion that leads to unconventional phase space dynamics and edge state structure generic to a family of complex crystals.</description>

      <title>Deformation of a one dimensional ferromagnetic domain wall due to double exchange interaction with a free electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. We find that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is greatly deformed towards larger width. For double magnetic wall systems the electronic energy depends on the relative chirality of the domain walls while the conductance is basically independent of it. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Magnetotransport Signature of antiskyrmions in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging magnetic fields related to the presence of topologically protected spin textures such as skyrmions are expected to give rise to additional, topology-related contributions to the Hall effect. In order to doubtlessly identify this so-called topological Hall effect, it is crucial to disentangle such contributions from the anomalous Hall effect. This necessitates a direct correlation of the transversal Hall voltage with the underlying magnetic textures. We utilize a novel measurement platform that allows to acquire high-resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy images of magnetic textures as a function of an external magnetic field and to concurrently measure the (anomalous) Hall voltage in-situ in the microscope on one and the same specimen. We use this approach to investigate the transport signatures of the chiral soliton lattice and antiskyrmions in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. Notably, the observed textures allow to fully understand the measured Hall voltage without the need of any additional contributions due to a topological Hall effect, and the field-controlled formation and annihilation of anstiskyrmions are found to have no effect on the measurend Hall voltage.</description>

      <title>Interface engineering of van der Waals heterostructures towards energy-efficient quantum devices operating at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum devices, which rely on quantum mechanical effects for their operation, may offer advantages, such as reduced dimensions, increased speed, and energy efficiency, compared to conventional devices. However, quantum phenomena are typically observed only at cryogenic temperatures, which limits their practical applications. Two-dimensional materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures provide a promising platform for high-temperature quantum devices owing to their strong Coulomb interactions and/or spin-orbit coupling. In this review, we summarise recent research on emergent quantum phenomena in vdW heterostructures based on interlayer tunnelling and the coupling of charged particles and spins, including negative differential resistance, Josephson tunnelling, exciton condensation, and topological superconductivity. The natural homojunction within vdW layered materials offers clean interfaces and perfectly aligned structures for enhanced interlayer coupling. Twisted bilayers with small angles may also give rise to novel quantum effects. In addition, we highlight several proposed structures for achieving high-temperature Majorana zero modes, which are critical elements of topological quantum computing. This review is helpful for researchers working on interface engineering of vdW heterostructures for energy-efficient quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in Quantum Hall Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (2D SSH) model in the quantum Hall regime using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF). The device Hamiltonian, where the 2D SSH model serves as the channel, is constructed using a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model. The effect of an external perpendicular magnetic field is incorporated into the contacts via Peierls substitution. We observe a transition from a gapped phase to a flat band regime at zero energy by varying the magnetic field. This transition is characterized by the emergence of highly localized states in the bulk or edges, which we observe by calculating local density-of-states (LDOS). We analyze transport in the system along two directions ($x$ and $y$) via transmission measurements, indicating a magnetic field-induced transition from insulating to metallic phase. The study of the energy spectrum of the system shows the formation of Landau levels. Moreover, the quantum number of the non-degenerate and degenerate Landau levels (transmission modes) can be any integer or only an odd integer, depending on diagonal, inter-cell, and intra-cell hopping strengths. From the analysis of the transport properties along $y$-direction, we find that edge modes play a crucial role in facilitating ballistic transport.</description>

      <title>Analytic approach to thermoelectric transport in double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed analytical solution for the equations of motion of the one-body Green function of the double quantum dot is extended to the out-of-equilibrium situation. By solving a linear system for the density correlators, not only the local occupations but also charge and heat currents as well as transport coefficients and the figure of merit are analytically derived in terms of system parameters and external driving forces. The emerging regions of stable occupation and finite currents are explained in terms of addition and removal energies, corresponding to the poles of the Green function. The analytical results are validated against the hierarchical equations of motion method, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Gapped and gapless quantum spin liquids on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ruby lattice has been the subject of much interest recently due its realization in Rydberg atom arrays, where its rich variety of frustrated interactions gives rise to topologically ordered quantum spin liquids. Similarly, numerical studies of ruby-lattice spin models, with both isotropic and anisotropic interactions, have provided evidence of gapped and gapless spin-liquid ground states with different low-energy gauge structures. Motivated by these findings, we perform a projective symmetry group (PSG) classification of U(1) and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ fermionic spinon mean-field theories$\unicode{x2014}$respecting space-group and time-reversal symmetries$\unicode{x2014}$for $S=1/2$ spins. We obtain a total of 50 U(1) and 64 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ PSGs, and upon restricting their realization via mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ with up to second-nearest-neighbor singlet amplitudes (relevant to the models studied here), only 8 U(1) and 18 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ distinct states are obtained. We present the singlet fields for all $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ up to third-nearest-neighboring bonds and discuss their spinon dispersions as well as their dynamical spin structure factors. Building on this information, we also obtain the phase diagram of the Heisenberg model in the presence of first ($J_{1}$), second ($J_{1}'$), and third ($J_{2}$) neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings within a self-consistent mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsic multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using minimal tight-binding models previously calculated by ab initio methods. We close with comments on potential further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in a phenomenological model of a marginal Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strange metal is a mysterious non-Fermi liquid which shows linear-in-$T$ resistivity behavior at finite temperatures, and, as found in recent experiment, vanishingly small shot noise in the linear-in-$T$ regime. Here, we investigate the shot noise of a strange metal based on a phenomenological model of marginal Fermi liquid (MFL), where fermions couple to some collective boson mode, leading to $T$-linear scattering rate at finite $T$. It is found that in the diffusive regime where the MFL scattering length is small compared to the system size, the shot noise vanishes, and the thermal noise becomes a temperature- and voltage-independent constant. Introducing additional impurity scattering increases the shot noise, and is probably consistent with the current experiment.</description>

      <title>Broadband measurement of Feibelman's quantum surface response functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Feibelman $d$-parameter, a mesoscopic complement to the local bulk permittivity, describes quantum optical surface responses for interfaces, including nonlocality, spill-in and-out, and surface-enabled Landau damping. It has been incorporated into the macroscopic Maxwellian framework for convenient modeling and understanding of nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena, calling for the compilation of a $d$-parameter database for interfaces of interest in nano-optics. However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.</description>

      <title>Optothermal Revolution: Colloids in an Optical Ring Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional motion is commonly observed in various living active systems, such as bacterial colonies moving through confined environments. In these systems, the dynamics arise from the collective effects of mutual interactions between individual elements, as well as their interactions with obstacles or boundaries. In this study, we turn our focus to an artificial system and experimentally investigate the emergence of directional revolution in dimer and trimer structures composed of colloidal particles in ring-shaped optical illumination. In this case, the movement of these colloidal structures is exclusively facilitated by optothermal interactions without any direct mechanical force applied from the external optical field. Depending on the optical absorption properties of the colloidal particles, these optothermal interactions can exhibit both attractive and repulsive characteristics. The attractive interactions provide the necessary driving force that propels the motion, while the repulsive interactions serve to control the structural parameters of the system. The arrangement and interaction of the colloidal particles within these dimer and trimer structures fuel the controlled, directional revolution, with the optical gradient force acting as a confining factor, guiding the movement along a specific path. Notably, the dynamics of these systems can be tuned by altering the intensity of the optical field. This study can be useful as a model for understanding insights into biological systems where group dynamics and environmental interactions are key to coordinated movement.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Reservoir Computing based on Nonlinear Nanomechanical Resonators at Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to deep neural networks (DNNs) by replacing complex hidden layers with a fixed nonlinear system and training only the final layer. This work investigates nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) resonators for reservoir computing, utilizing inherent nonlinearities and the fading memory effect from NEMS's transient response. This approach transforms input data into a higher-dimensional space for effective classification. The smaller size and higher operating frequencies of the NEMS resonators enable faster processing rates than recent demonstrations with micromechanical systems, while their compact footprint and ability to operate under ambient conditions simplify integration into practical applications. Through an MNIST handwritten digit recognition test, this system achieved 90% accuracy with a 3.3-microsecond processing time per pixel, highlighting the potential for various applications that require efficient and fast information processing in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent multiexciton dynamics governs scintillation from perovskite quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent emergence of quantum confined nanomaterials in the field of radiation detection, in particular lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, offers potentially revolutionary scalability and performance advantages over conventional materials. This development raises fundamental questions about the mechanism of scintillation itself at the nanoscale and the role of particle size, arguably the most defining parameter of quantum dots. Understanding this is crucial for the design and optimisation of future nanotechnology scintillators. In this work, we address these open questions by theoretically and experimentally studying the size-dependent scintillation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and radiometric techniques. The results reveal and unravel a complex parametric space where the fine balance between the simultaneous effects of size-dependent energy deposition, (multi-)exciton population, and light emission under ionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the scintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to greater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The remarkable agreement between theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that unprecedentedly predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals without free parameters, providing the first fundamental guide for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.</description>

Based on a microscopic atomistic tight-binding model and Hartree-Fock and exact configuration-interaction tools we demonstrate the possibility of symmetry-broken valley polarized states for strongly interacting holes. The interplay between interactions, perpendicular magnetic field, and the lateral confinement asymmetry together with the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling present in WSe$_2$ material is analyzed, and its impact on valley polarization is discussed. For weaker interactions, an investigation of the pair correlation function reveals a valley-antiferromagnetic phase. For low hole densities, a formation of a zigzag Wigner crystal phase is predicted. The impact of various hole liquid phases on transport in a high mobility quasi-one dimensional channel is discussed.</description>

      <title>Single-Ion Spectroscopy of h-BN Point Defect Fluorescence in Liquid Environments</title>

Abstract: Understanding individual ions in solutions is essential for advancing our knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, tracking and detecting ions at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a challenge. We introduce a strategy for visualization and differentiation of different ions in liquid environment via point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the ion sensor. Ions interacting with the optically active point defects in h-BN alter emission properties, allowing us to capture these changes and visualize single ions. Using Li+ in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed a spectral shift of over 10 nm upon Li+ addition, and an over 50 nm red shift with applied electric fields due to reactions between Li+ and h-BN point defects. Frequency domain analysis further revealed the rapid dynamics of ion migration and the slow electrochemical reactions. We further spectroscopically differentiated various ions (H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Zn2+, Al3+) in aqueous solution. Each ion, with its distinct electron cloud configuration, interacts distinctively with the electron clouds of h-BN defects, resulting in specific and identifiable spectroscopic signatures. This ion sensing platform enables the direct visualization and differentiation of individual ions in a liquid environment, offering insights into chemical reactions at the single-ion level. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids, including but not limited to biology, battery technology, and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady-state thermoelectrics of Kondo-correlated quantum dots</title>

Abstract: The transport across a Kondo-correlated quantum dot coupled to two leads with independent temperatures and chemical potentials is studied using a controlled non-perturbative, and in this sense exact numeric treatment based on a hybrid numerical renormalization group combined with time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (NRG-tDMRG). We find a peak in the conductance at finite voltage bias vs. the temperature gradient $\Delta T = T_R - T_L$ across left and right lead. We then focus predominantly on zero voltage bias but finite $\Delta T$ far beyond linear response. We reveal the dependence of the characteristic zero-bias conductance on the individual lead temperatures. We find that the finite-$\Delta T$ data behaves quantitatively similar to linear response with an effective equilibrium temperature derived from the different lead temperatures. The regime of sign changes in the Seebeck coefficient, signaling the presence of Kondo correlations, and its dependence on the individual lead temperatures provide a complete picture of the Kondo regime in the presence of finite temperature gradients. The results from the zero-bias conductance and Seebeck coefficient studies unveil an approximate `Kondo circle' in the $T_L/T_R$ plane as the regime within which the Kondo correlations dominate. We also study the heat current and the corresponding heat conductance vs. finite $\Delta T$. We provide a polynomial fit for our numerical results for the thermocurrent as a function of the individual lead temperatures which may be used to fit experimental data in the Kondo regime.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for dispersion relations of spacetime-periodic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Bloch states of weak spacetime-periodic perturbations of homogeneous materials in one spatial dimension. The interplay of space- and time-periodicity leads to an infinitely degenerate dispersion relation in the free case. We consider a general perturbation term, and, as a consequence of the infinite degeneracy, we show that the effective equations are given by the eigenvalue problem of an infinite matrix. Our method can be viewed as a time-modulated generalisation of the nearly-free electron model. Based on this result, we find that the infinite degeneracy may split into a family of non-degenerate bands. Our results are illustrated with numerical calculations, and we observe close agreement between the perturbation theory and the numerically computed full solution.</description>

      <title>Mirror-protected Majorana zero modes in $f$-wave multilayer graphene superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental discoveries of superconductivity in chirally-stacked and twisted multilayer graphene, we study models of $f$-wave superconductivity on the honeycomb lattice with arbitrary numbers of layers. These models respect a mirror symmetry that allows classification of the bands by a mirror-projected winding number $\nu_\pm$. For odd numbers of layers, the systems are topologically nontrivial with $\nu_\pm = \pm 1$. Along each mirror-preserving edge in armchair nanoribbons, there are two protected Majorana zero modes. These modes are present even if the sample is finite in both directions, such as in rectangular and hexagonal flakes. Crucially, zero modes can also be confined to vortex cores, which can be created by a magnetic field or localized magnetic impurities and accessed by local scanning probes. Finally, we apply these models to twisted bilayer and trilayer systems, which also feature boundary-projected and vortex-confined zero modes. Since vortices are experimentally accessible, our study suggests that superconducting multilayer graphene systems are promising platforms to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Bond Dipole based Geometric Theory of Band Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The band alignment (BA) between two materials is a fundamental property that governs the functionality and performance of electronic, as well as electrochemical, devices. However, despite decades of study, the inability to separate surface properties from those of bulk have made a deep understanding of the physics of BA illusive. Building on the theory of ideal vacuum level to separate surface from bulk [CWZ, Phys. Rev. B 103, 235202 (2021)], here we present a geometric theory for the band alignment, particularly, explaining the insensitivity of the alignment to interfacial orientation between isotropic materials. First, we adopt charge neutral polyhedron, termed Wigner-Seitz atoms (WSA), to partition the charge of atoms in a way which maintains crystal symmetry and tessellates the space. In contrast to CWZ theory, the band alignment of two materials constructed from such WSAs is independent of interface orientation. Upon electron relaxation at the interface, here we show that the interfacial charge transfer dipole can be faithfully descibed by the sum of localized point dipoles which exist between atoms at the interface (bond dipoles). For interfaces between isotropic materials, the magnitude of the bond dipole can be factored out as a multiplier, leaving only geometric factors, such as the crystal symmetry and dimension of the material, to determine band alignment, irrespective of the orientation of the interface. We considered 29 distinct interfaces and found that this bond dipole theory yields excellent agreement (RMS deviation &lt; 30 meV) with first-principles results. Our theory can be straightforwardly applied to interface between alloys, as well as between anisotropic systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Multifunctionality in Two-Dimensional Janus VSBrI Monolayer: A Study of Multiferroicity, Magnetoelectricity, and Piezoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Janus VSBrI monolayer, identified by first-principles calculations, emerges as a promising semiconducting material with desirable ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties. It's in-plane magnetic anisotropic energy is up to 460 $\mu$eV/V , and in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficients are larger than many other known two-dimensional materials. The energy variations among different magnetic states show a strong correlate with polarization. Interestingly, the stability of the ferroelectric phase can be further enhanced by the application of biaxial tensile strain. These intriguing properties make the Janus VSBrI monolayer highly desirable for practical applications in piezoelectronic devices, and a promising candidate for multifunctional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Solving Free Fermion Problems on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of time-dynamics and thermal states of free fermions on $N = 2^n$ modes are known to require at most poly($2^n$) computational classical resources. We present several such free fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with exponentially-improved, poly($n$) cost. The key technique is the block-encoding of the correlation matrix into a unitary. We demonstrate how such a unitary can be efficiently realized as a quantum circuit, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field studies of Wigner crystal transitions in various interacting two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study Wigner crystal (WC) transitions in various interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) models, including both conventional 2DEG model and ``$n$-order" Dirac fermion models with energy-momentum dispersion $E_{\mathbf{k}} \sim k^n$, with $n$ being positive integer. A general ``$GW$+RPA" framework to treat single-particle spectra and ground-state energies in 2D systems has been developed. Within such a framework, we first calculate the single-particle excitation spectra of a conventional 2DEG system with $GW$ approximation for both Wigner-crystal state and Fermi-liquid (FL) state, in which the frequency dependent dielectric function is treated using a multiple-plasma-pole approach. Then, the correlation energy with random phase approximation (RPA) is further calculated based on the $GW$ single-particle spectra. By comparing the total energies of WC and FL states, our $GW$+RPA approach gives a critical Wigner-Seitz radius $r_s^*\sim 19.2$ for the WC transition in conventional 2DEG system. We then apply such $GW$+RPA method to single-flavor $n$-order Dirac fermion models, unveiling the unique single-particle excitation spectra in these models. We further find that charge fluctuations would de-stabilize the presumable WC states, including both topologically trivial and nontrivial WC states. Our method can be readily applied to other interacting 2D systems described by continuum models such as moir\'e superlattices.</description>
