      <title>Uncountable homogeneous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of uncountable first-order structures that are homogeneous with respect to their finitely generated substructures. In many classical cases this is either well-known or follows from general facts, for example, if the language is finite and relational then ultrapowers provide arbitrarily large such sturctures. On the other hand, there are no general results saying that uncountable homogeneous structures with a given age exist. We examine the monoid of self-embeddings of a fixed countable homogeneous structure and, using abstract Fra\"iss\'e theory, we present a method of constructing an uncountable homogeneous structure, based on the amalgamation property of this monoid.</description>

      <title>On a lattice of relational spaces (reducts) for the order of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the definability (reducts) lattice of the order of integers and describe a sublattice generated by relations 'between', 'cycle', 'separation', 'neighbor', '1-codirection', 'order' and equality'. Some open questions are proposed.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of the elementary theory of Young--Fibonacci lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a poset $(P,\leqslant)$ we consider the first-order theory, that is defined by set $P$ and relation $\leqslant$. The problem of undecidability of combinatorial theories attracts significant attention. Recently A. Wires proved the undecidability of the elementary theory of Young lattice and also established the maximal definability property of this theory. The purpose of this article is to obtain the same results for another graded lattice, which has much in common with Young lattice: Young--Fibonacci lattice. As Wires does for Young lattice, for the proof of undecidability we define Arithmetic into this theory.</description>

      <title>Graph structure of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics is proved to admit no hidden-variable in 1960s, which means the quantum systems are contextual. Revealing the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is a significant task. We develop the approach of partial Boolean algebra to characterize the contextuality theory with local consistency and exclusivity, and then prove that the finite quantum systems are determined by atoms using two graph structure theorems. We also generalize our work to infinite cases. Our conclusions indicate that the quantum mechanics is a graph-structured combination of multiple hidden-variable theories, and provide a precise mathematical framework for quantum contextuality</description>

      <title>Expressive Power of Infinitary Logic and Absolute co-Hopfianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Paolini and Shelah have constructed absolutely Hopfian torsion-free abelian groups of any given size. In contrast, we show that this is not necessarily the case for absolutely co-Hopfian groups. We use the infinitary logic to show that there are no absolute co-Hopfian abelian groups above the first beautiful cardinal. An extension of this result to the category of modules over a commutative ring is given.</description>

      <title>Completeness and Well-Definability of a Provability Degree Measure in Sufficiently Powerful Formal Systems, and Finite-Time Effective Knowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that including degrees of a particular kind of provability in the search target for any theorem-prover in sufficiently powerful formal systems over finite-sized statements preserves well-definition and a sufficient consistency while establishing completeness. Moreover, the union of such degrees is isomorphic to such a system's {\aleph_0} statements and permits the construction of a best-possible (up to a quadratic term) finite-time theorem knower, {\phi}', while still subject to limitations in these formal systems. These results, owing to the fact that {\phi}' may arise through the behavior of any unbounded inductive computation, establish results on the eventual behavior of a class of computational processes.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Public Announcement Logic: Base-extension Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proof-theoretic semantics, and base-extension semantics in particular, can be seen as a logical realization of inferentialism, in which the meaning of expressions is understood through their use. We present a base-extension semantics for public announcement logic, building on earlier work giving a base-extension semantics for the modal logic $S5$, which in turn builds on earlier such work for $K$, $KT$, $K4$, and $S4$. These analyses rely on a notion of `modal relation' on bases. The main difficulty in extending the existing B-eS for $S5$ to public announcement logic is to account announcements of the form $[\psi]\phi$, which, in this setting, update the modal relations on bases. We provide a detailed analysis of two classical examples, namely the three-player card game and the muddy children puzzle. These examples illustrate how the inferentialist perspective requires fully explicit information about the state of the participating agents.</description>
