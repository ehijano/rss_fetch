      <title>Suppression of errors in collectively coded information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires highly processive copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligos that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even if the mutation rate is above the error catastrophe for a physically intact genome.</description>

      <title>A universal animal communication tempo resonates with the receiver's brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During fieldwork in Thailand we observed nearly identical frequencies of co-located flashing fireflies and chirping crickets. Motivated by this, we perform a meta-analysis and show an abundance of evolutionarily distinct species that communicate isochronously at ~0.5-4 Hz, suggesting that this might be a frequency "hotspot." We hypothesize that this timescale may have a universal basis in the biophysics of the receiver's neurons. We test this by demonstrating that small receiver circuits constructed from elements representing typical neurons will be most responsive in the observed frequency range.</description>

      <title>The Feller diffusion conditioned on a single ancestral founder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the distributional properties of a Feller diffusion $(X(\tau))_{\tau \in [0, t]}$ conditioned on the current population $X(t)$ having a single ancestor at time zero. The approach is novel and is based on an interpretation of Feller's original solution according to which the current population is comprised of a Poisson number of exponentially distributed families, each descended from a single ancestor. The distribution of the number of ancestors at intermediate times and the joint density of coalescent times is determined under assumptions of initiation of the process from a single ancestor at a specified time in the past, including infinitely far in the past, and for the case of a uniform prior on the time since initiation. Also calculated are the joint distribution of the time since the most recent common ancestor of the current population and the contemporaneous population size at that time under different assumptions on the time since initiation. In each case exact solutions are given for supercritical, critical and subcritical diffusions. For supercritical diffusions asymptotic forms of distributions are also given in the limit of unbounded exponential growth.</description>
