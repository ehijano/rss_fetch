      <title>High Throughput Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis Applied to the Production of Mycoprotein from Synthetic Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current global food system produces substantial waste and carbon emissions while exacerbating the effects of global hunger and protein deficiency. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the use of lignocellulosic agricultural residues as feedstocks for microbial protein fermentation, focusing on Fusarium venenatum A3/5, a mycelial strain known for its high protein yield and quality. We propose a high throughput microlitre batch fermentation system paired with analytical chemistry to generate time-series data of microbial growth and substrate utilisation. An unstructured biokinetic model was developed using a bootstrap sampling approach to quantify uncertainty in the parameter estimates. The model was validated against an independent dataset of a different glucose-xylose composition to assess the predictive performance. Our results indicate a robust model fit with high coefficients of determination and low root mean squared errors for biomass, glucose, and xylose concentrations. Estimated parameter values provided insights into the resource utilisation strategies of Fusarium venenatum A3/5 in mixed substrate cultures, aligning well with previous research findings. Significant correlations between estimated parameters were observed, highlighting challenges in parameter identifiability. This work provides a foundational model for optimising the production of microbial protein from lignocellulosic waste, contributing to a more sustainable global food system.</description>

      <title>Feeders and Expellers, Two Types of Animalcules With Outboard Cilia, Have Distinct Surface Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within biological fluid dynamics, it is conventional to distinguish between "puller" and "pusher" microswimmers on the basis of the forward or aft location of the flagella relative to the cell body: typically, bacteria are pushers and algae are pullers. Here we note that since many pullers have "outboard" cilia or flagella displaced laterally from the cell centerline on both sides of the organism, there are two important subclasses whose far-field is that of a stresslet, but whose near field is qualitatively more complex. The ciliary beat creates not only a propulsive force but also swirling flows that can be represented by paired rotlets with two possible senses of rotation, either "feeders" that sweep fluid toward the cell apex, or "expellers" that push fluid away. Experimental studies of the rotifer $Brachionus~plicatilis$ in combination with earlier work on the green algae $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$ show that the two classes have markedly different interactions with surfaces. When swimming near a surface, expellers such as $C.~reinhardtii$ scatter from the wall, whereas a feeder like $B.~plicatilis$ stably attaches. This results in a stochastic "run-and-stick" locomotion, with periods of ballistic motion parallel to the surface interrupted by trapping at the surface.</description>

      <title>Quantifying T cell morphodynamics and migration in 3D collagen matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T cells undergo large shape changes (morphodynamics) when migrating. While progress has been made elucidating the molecular basis of cell migration, statistical characterization of morphodynamics and migration has been limited, particularly in physiologically realistic 3D environments. A previous study (H. Cavanagh et al., J. R. Soc. Interface 19: 20220081) found discrete states of dynamics as well as periodic oscillations of shape. However, we show that these results are due to artifacts of the analysis methods. Here, we present a revised analysis of the data, applying a method based on an underdamped Langevin equation. We find that different shape modes have different correlation times. We also find novel non-Gaussian effects. This study provides a framework in which quantitative comparisons of cell morphodynamics and migration can be made, e.g. between different biological conditions or mechanistic models.</description>
