      <title>Nuclear Spectral Energy Distributions of Luminous Infrared Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present nuclear (100-150 pc) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 23 nearby luminous infrared galaxies hosting a total of 28 nuclei. We gather aperture photometry from high-resolution X-ray to submillimeter data for each nuclear region localized by ALMA observations of the dust continuum. We model the broadband SEDs using X-CIGALE. Binning the merging systems by interaction class, we find that the AGN fraction (fraction of AGN infrared luminosity to total infrared luminosity) appears enhanced in the late- and post-merger stages compared to early-stage mergers. Examining the relationship between X-ray emission and infrared emission of the nuclear regions, we find that the infrared emission in the nucleus is dominated by dust and AGN, with minimal contribution from stars. We also find that nuclear regions have higher X-ray hardness ratios than the host galaxies globally among both the AGN and non-AGN population. We highlight the similarities and differences in the SEDs of dual nuclei in five closely separated late-stage merging systems: Arp 220 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 0.5 kpc), NGC 6240 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 1 kpc), IRAS 07251-0248 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 2 kpc), IRAS F12112+0305 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 4 kpc), and IRAS F14348+1447 ($d_\mathrm{nuc} \sim$ 6 kpc). The SEDs for these resolved pairs are distinct, suggesting that the AGN state is much more susceptible to the stellar and dust content within the immediate circumnuclear ($&lt;$150 pc) environment than to the host's global infrared luminosity or merger stage.</description>

      <title>Line-of-Sight Velocity Projection Impact on the Local Group Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass of the Local Group (LG), comprising the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda (M31), and their satellites, is crucial for validating galaxy formation and cosmological models. Traditional virial mass estimates, which rely on line-of-sight (LoS) velocities and simplified infall assumptions, are prone to systematic biases due to unobserved velocity components and anisotropic kinematics. Using the TNG cosmological simulation, we examine two limiting cases: the \underline{minor infall} model -- ignoring perpendicular velocities to the LoS directions) and the \underline{major infall} model -- assuming purely radial motion towards the Center of Mass (CoM). Our simulations demonstrate that geometric corrections are vital: the minor-infall model underestimates the true mass, while the major-infall model overestimates it. By applying these calibrated corrections to observed dwarf galaxy kinematics within 1 Mpc of the LG's CoM, we derive a refined LG mass of $M_{\mathrm{LG}} = (2.99 \pm 0.60) \times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. This finding aligns with predictions from the $\Lambda$CDM model, timing arguments, and independent mass estimates, resolving previous discrepancies. Our analysis highlights the importance of correcting for velocity anisotropy and offers a robust framework for dynamical mass estimation in galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-dominated CGM: the origin of UV absorbers with equivalent widths of $\sim1$\AA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and observations suggest that in massive halos ($&gt;10^{12}\,M_\odot$), the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is dominated by a 'hot' phase with gas temperature near the virial temperature ($T \approx T_{\rm vir}$) and a quasi-hydrostatic pressure profile. Lower-mass halos are however unlikely to be filled with a similar quasi-static hot phase, due to rapid radiative cooling. Using the FIRE cosmological zoom simulations, we demonstrate that the hot phase is indeed sub-dominant at inner radii ($\lesssim 0.3\,R_{\rm vir}$) of $\lesssim 10^{12}\,M_\odot$ halos, and the inner CGM is instead filled with $T \ll T_{\rm vir}$ gas originating in outflows and inflows, with a turbulent velocity comparable to the halo virial velocity. The turbulent velocity thus exceeds the mass-weighted sound speed in the inner CGM, and the turbulence is supersonic. UV absorption features from such CGM trace the wide lognormal density distributions of the predominantly cool and turbulent volume-filling phase, in contrast with tracing localized cool 'clouds' embedded in a hot medium. We predict equivalent widths of $W_\lambda \sim 2\lambda v_c/c \sim 1A$ for a broad range of strong UV and EUV transitions (Mg II, C II, C IV, Si II-IV, O III-V) in sightlines through inner CGM dominated by turbulent pressure of $\lesssim L^*$ galaxies at redshifts $0 \leq z \lesssim 2$, where $\lambda$ is the transition wavelength, $v_{\rm c}$ is the halo circular velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. Comparison of our predictions with observational constraints suggests that star-forming dwarf and $\lesssim L^*$ galaxies are generally dominated by turbulent pressure in their inner CGM, rather than by thermal pressure. The inner CGM surrounding these galaxies is thus qualitatively distinct from that around quenched galaxies and massive disks such as the Milky-Way, in which thermal pressure likely dominates.</description>

      <title>The p-Laplacian as a Framework for Generalizing Newtonian Gravity and MoND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) follows from Milgromian gravitation (MoND). Velocity dispersion data of many dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and galaxy clusters have been reported to be in tension with it. We consider the Generalized Poisson Equation (GPE), expressed in terms of the p-Laplacian, which has been applied in electrodynamics. We investigate whether it can address these tensions. From the GPE we derive a generalized RAR characterized by the $p$-parameter from the p-Laplacian and a velocity dispersion formula for a Plummer model. We apply these models to Milky Way and Andromeda dSphs and HIFLUGS galaxy clusters and derive a $p$-parameter for each dSph and galaxy cluster. We explore a relation of $p$ to the mass density of the bound system, and alternatively a relation of $p$ to the external field predicted from Newtonian gravity. This ansatz allows the deviations of dSphs and galaxy clusters from the RAR without introducing dark matter. Data points deviate from the Milgromian case, $p=3$, with up to $5\sigma$-confidence. Also, we find the model predicts velocity dispersions, each of which lies in the 1$\sigma$-range of their corresponding data point allowing the velocity dispersion to be predicted for dSphs from their baryonic density. The functional relation between the mass density of the bound system and $p$ suggests $p$ to increase with decreasing density. We find for the critical cosmological density $p(\rho_{\text{crit}}) = 12.27 \pm 0.39$. This implies significantly different behaviour of gravitation on cosmological scales. Alternatively, the functional relation between $p$ and the external Newtonian gravitational field suggests $p$ to decrease with increasing field strength.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov analysis of JWST deep survey galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST galaxy deep spectral surveys provide a unique opportunity to trace a broad range of evolutionary features of galaxies and the intergalactic medium given the huge distance the photons are propagating. We have analyzed the spectral data of JWST galaxies up to a redshift of around 7 using the Kolmogorov technique, which is an efficient tool for testing the tiny comparative randomness properties of cumulative signals, that is, for distinguishing the contributions of regular and stochastic sub-signals. Our aim is to determine if certain identical spectral features of galaxies have undergone any distortions or systematic evolution across a broad range of redshifts. Our results indicate a change in the spectral properties of the sample galaxies at around z \simeq 2.7 at over a 99% confidence level.</description>

      <title>A Sandwich Model for Changing-Look AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral variability of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) occurred on timescales of years to tens of years, posing a significant challenge to the standard thin disk model. In this work, we propose a sandwich model, including an optically thick disk in the mid-plane (Disk 1) and two disks of low effective optical depth on both sides (Disk 2). These two types of disks are coupled with magnetic fields, which allow viscous torque interaction between them. As a consequence, the radial velocity of Disk 1 can increase by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the standard thin disk, leading to an equivalent decrease in the accretion timescale. Therefore, such a sandwich model can account for the rapid variability in CL-AGNs. In addition, we also discuss the influence of the magnetic pressure on Disk 2. When Disk 2 is dominated by the magnetic pressure, it resembles a "warm corona", which is responsible for the soft X-ray excess.</description>

      <title>Formation of the glycine isomer glycolamide (NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH) on the surfaces of interstellar ice grains: Insights from atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Syn-glycolamide, a glycine isomer, has recently been detected in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud. Investigations on its formation in the interstellar medium could offer insights into synthetic routes leading to glycine in prebiotic environments. Quantum chemical simulations on glycolamide (NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH) formation on interstellar ice mantles, mimicked by a water ice cluster model, are presented. Glycolamide synthesis has been here modeled considering a stepwise process: the coupling between formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and the radical of formamide (NH$_2$CO$^{\bullet}$) occurs first, forming the glycolamide precursor NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$, which is then hydrogenated to give anti-glycolamide. We hypothesize that anti-to-syn interconversion will occur in conjunction with glycolamide desorption from the ice surface. The reaction barrier for NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$ formation varies from 9 to 26 kJ mol$^{-1}$, depending on surface binding sites. Kinetic studies indicate that this reaction step is feasible in environments with a $T &gt; 35~\text{K}$, until desorption of the reactants. The hydrogenation step leading to anti-glycolamide presents almost no energy barrier due to the easy H atom diffusion towards the NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$ intermediate. However, it competes with the extraction of an H atom from the formyl group of NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$, which leads to formyl formamide, NH$_2$C(O)CHO, and H$_2$. Nonetheless, according to our results, anti-glycolamide formation is predicted to be the most favored reactive channel.</description>

      <title>Population III Supernovae as a dust factory I --- molecule formation and mixing/fallback in ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed the spectral feature of carbonaceous grains even in a very distant galaxy. We develop a state-of-the-art dust synthesis code by self-consistently solving molecule and dust formation in supernova (SN) ejecta that contain various elements in different layers. With a progenitor mass 25 Msun and explosion energy 10^{52} erg, we run the following four test calculations to investigate the impact of input physics. (i) With molecule formation solved, our SN model produces 8.45x10^{-2} Msun carbonaceous grains. (ii) If all available C and Si were initially depleted into CO and SiO molecules, respectively, the C grain mass could be underestimated by ~40%. In these two models producing 0.07 Msun 56Ni without mixing fallback, a large amount of silicates (0.260 Msun) created in O-rich layers are also ejected and likely to hide the spectral feature of carbonaceous grains. We then consider mixing-fallback that can reproduce the observed elemental abundance ratios of C-normal and C-enhanced extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. (iii) In the former, the mass ratio of carbonaceous to silicate grains is still small (~0.3). However, (iv) in the latter (known as a ``faint SN'), while the C grain mass is unchanged (6.78x10^{-2} Msun), the silicate mass is reduced (9.98x10^{-3} Msun). Therefore, we conclude that faint SNe can be a significant carbonaceous dust factory in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A negative stellar mass$-$gaseous metallicity gradient relation of dwarf galaxies modulated by stellar feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic cycling is reflected in the spatial distribution of metallicity within galaxies, yet gas-phase metallicity distribution and its connection with other properties of dwarf galaxies are largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities for a sample of 55 normal nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies (stellar mass $M_\star$ ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{9.5}\ M_\odot$), based on MUSE spectroscopic observations. We find that metallicity gradient shows a significant negative correlation (correlation coefficient $r \approx -0.56$) with $\log M_\star$, in contrast to the flat or even positive correlation observed for higher-mass galaxies. This negative correlation is accompanied by a stronger central suppression of metallicity compared to the outskirts in lower-mass galaxies. Among the other explored galaxy properties-including baryonic mass, star formation distribution, galaxy environment, regularity of the gaseous velocity field, and effective yield of metals $y_{\rm eff}$-only the velocity field regularity and $y_{\rm eff}$ show residual correlation with the metallicity gradient after controlling for $M_\star$, in the sense that galaxies with irregular velocity fields or lower $y_{\rm eff}$ tend to have less negative or more positive gradients. Particularly, a linear combination of $\log M_\star$ and $\log y_{\rm eff}$ significantly improves the correlation with metallicity gradient ($r \approx -0.68$) compared to $\log M_\star$ alone. The lack of correlation with environment disfavors gas accretion as a dominant factor. Our findings imply that metal mixing and transport processes, including but not limited to feedback-driven outflows, are more important than in-situ metal production in shaping the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Premature supermassive black hole mergers in cosmological simulations of structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The co-evolution of massive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies is well-established within the hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm. Large-scale cosmological simulations are an ideal tool to study the repeated BH mergers, accretion and feedback that conspire to regulate this process. While such simulations are of fundamental importance for understanding the complex and intertwined relationship between BHs and their hosts, they are plagued with numerical inaccuracies at the scale of individual BH orbits. To quantify this issue, taking advantage of the $(100 \, h^{-1}\,\text{cMpc})^3$ FABLE simulation box, we track all individual BH mergers and the corresponding host galaxy mergers as a function of cosmic time. We demonstrate that BH mergers frequently occur prematurely, well before the corresponding merger of the host galaxies is complete, and that BHs are sometimes erroneously displaced from their hosts during close galaxy encounters. Correcting for these artefacts results in substantial macrophysical delays, spanning over several Gyrs, which are additional to any microphysical delays arising from unresolved BH binary hardening processes. We find that once the macrophysical delays are accounted for, high-mass BH merger events are suppressed, affecting the predictions for the BH population that may be observable with LISA and pulsar timing arrays. Furthermore, including these macrophysical delays leads to an increase in the number of observable dual active galactic nuclei, especially at lower redshifts, with respect to FABLE. Our results highlight the pressing need for more accurate modelling of BH dynamics in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation as we prepare for the multi-messenger era.</description>

      <title>The quest for high-redshift radio galaxies. I. A pilot spectroscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) is still poorly studied because only a few of these objects are currently known. We here present the results of a pilot project of spectroscopic identification of HzRG candidates. The candidates are selected by combining low-frequency radio and optical surveys that cover a total of ~2,000 squared degrees using the dropout technique, that is, the presence of a redshifted Lyman break in their photometric data. We focused on 39 g-dropout sources, which is about one-third of the selected sources, that are expected to be at 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.5.
  We considered single and double radio sources separately and searched for g-dropout sources at the location of the midpoint of the radio structure for the latter. The host galaxy is expected to be located there. We confirm only one out of 29 candidate HzRG associated with an extended radio source. For the compact radio sources, we instead reach a success rate of 30% by confirming 3 out of 10 HzRG targets.
  The four newly discovered HzRGs show a wide range of spectral radio slopes. This supports the idea that not all HzRGs are ultrasteep radio sources (USSs). The criterion for USSs is most commonly used to find HzRGs, but this method only selects a subpopulation. We discuss various contamination sources for the objects that are selected with the Lyman-break method and conclude that they are likely mainly HzRGs, but with a Ly$\alpha$ line that is underluminous with respect to expectations.</description>

      <title>Hot Diggity Dog: A complete analysis of the extreme molecular gas and dust properties at kpc scales in the hyper-luminous hot, dust-obscured galaxy W2246-0526</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), the most infrared (IR) luminous objects selected by the WISE all-sky mid-IR survey, have yielded a sample of intrinsically luminous quasars (QSOs) with obscured nuclear activity and hot dust temperatures. The molecular gas excitation properties have yet to be examined in detail under such extreme conditions. Here we study the most far-IR luminous WISE Hot DOG W2246-0526, focusing on the central host galaxy. Multi-J CO transition measurements at J=2-1, 5-4, 7-6, 12-11, and 17-16 provide the most well-sampled CO excitation ladder of any WISE Hot DOG to date, providing the first self-consistent modeling constraints on the molecular gas and dust properties. We implement a state-of-the-art TUrbulent Non-Equilibrium Radiative transfer model (TUNER) that simultaneously models both the line and dust continuum measurements. Due to a combination of high molecular gas densities and high kinetic temperatures, this extreme CO spectral line energy distribution peaks at J = 10 to 12, likely making this the most highly excited galaxy ever reported. We derive the alpha_CO conversion factors and conclude that (J=3-7) CO line luminosities trace the bulk of the molecular gas mass. W2246-0526 is a rapidly evolving system, with a high value of the molecular gas kinetic temperature versus dust temperature T_k / T_d ~ 3.9, reflecting previously reported shocks and outflows injecting kinetic energy within the central kpc of this host. This first comprehensive simultaneous modeling of both the molecular gas and dust in any object within the WISE-selected Hot DOG sample motivates obtaining well-sampled dust and line spectral energy distributions to better understand the conditions within these short-lived episodes in galaxy evolution that are associated with the most obscured supermassive black hole activity.</description>

      <title>Nearby open clusters with tidal features: golden sample selection and 3D structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters offer unique opportunities to study stellar dynamics and evolution under the influence of their internal gravity, the Milky Way's gravitational field, and the interactions with encounters. Using the Gaia DR3 data for a catalog of open clusters within 500 parsecs that exhibit tidal features reported by the literature, we apply a novel method based on 3D principal component analysis to select a ``golden sample'' of nearby open clusters with minimal line-of-sight distortions. This approach ensures a systematic comparison of 3D and 2D structural parameters for tidally perturbed clusters. The selected golden sample includes Blanco 1, Melotte 20, Melotte 22, NGC 2632, NGC 7092, NGC 1662, Roslund 6 and Melotte 111. We analyze these clusters by fitting both 2D and 3D King Profiles to their stellar density distributions. Our results reveal systematic discrepancies: most of the golden sample clusters exhibit larger 3D tidal radii compared to their 2D counterparts, demonstrating that the 2D projection effects bias the measured cluster size. Furthermore, the 3D density profiles show stronger deviations from King profiles at the tidal radii ($\Delta \rho_{\rm 3D} &gt; \Delta \rho_{\rm 2D}$), highlighting enhanced sensitivity to tidal disturbances. Additionally, we investigate the spatial distribution of cluster members relative to their bulk motion in the Galactic plane. We find that some clusters exhibit tidal features oriented perpendicular to their direction of motion, which can be attributed to the fact that the current surveys only detect the curved inner regions of the tidal features. In conclusion, this work offers a golden sample of nearby open clusters that are most reliable for 3D structure analysis and underscores the necessity of 3D analysis in characterizing OC morphological asymmetries, determining cluster size, and identifying tidal features.</description>

      <title>Search for Quasar Pairs with ${\it Gaia}$ Astrometric Data. I. Method and Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasar pair, a special subclass of galaxy pair, is valuable in the investigation of quasar interaction, co-evolution, merger, and clustering, as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. However, quasar pairs at kpc-scale are rare in the universe. The scarcity of available samples hindered the deeper exploration and statistics of these objects. In this work, we apply an astrometric method to systematically search for quasar candidates within a transverse distance of 100 kpc to known quasars in the Million Quasar Catalog. These candidates are ${\it Gaia}$ sources with zero proper motion and zero parallax, which are the kinematic characteristics of extragalactic sources. Visual inspection of the sample was performed to remove the contamination of dense stellar fields and nearby galaxies. A total of 4,062 quasar pair candidates were isolated, with the median member separation, ${\it Gaia}$ G-band magnitude, and redshift of 8.81$^{\prime\prime}$, 20.49, and 1.59, respectively. Our catalog was compared with three major candidate quasar pair catalogs and identified 3,964 new quasar pair candidates previously uncataloged in the three catalogs. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up campaigns are being carried out to validate their astrophysical nature. Several interesting quasar pair candidates are highlighted and discussed. We also briefly discussed several techniques for improving the success rate of quasar pair selection.</description>

      <title>The First Photometric Evidence of a Transient/Variable Source at z&gt;5 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovered 79 transients out to $z$$\sim$4.8 through the JADES Transient Survey (JTS), but the JTS did not find any $z$$&gt;$5 transients. Here, we present the first photometric evidence of a $z$$&gt;$5 transient/variable source with JWST. The source, AT 2023adya, resides in a $z_{\mathrm{spec}}$$=$5.274 galaxy in GOODS-N, which dimmed from $m_{\rm F356W}$$=$26.05$\pm$0.02 mag to 26.24$\pm$0.02 mag in the rest-frame optical over approximately two rest-frame months, producing a clear residual signal in the difference image ($m_{\rm F356W}$$=$28.01$\pm$0.17 mag; SN$_\mathrm{var}$$=$6.09) at the galaxy center. Shorter-wavelength bands (F090W/F115W) show no rest-frame ultraviolet brightness change. Based on its rest-frame V-band absolute magnitude of M$_\mathrm{V}$$=$$-$18.48 mag, AT 2023adya could be any core-collapse supernova (SN) subtype or an SN Ia. However, due to low SN Ia rates at high redshift, the SN Ia scenario is unlikely. Alternatively, AT 2023adya may be a variable active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the JWST NIRCam/Grism spectrum shows no broad H$\alpha$ emission line (FWHM$=$130$\pm$26 km s$^{-1}$), disfavoring the variable AGN scenario. It is also unlikely that AT 2023adya is a tidal disruption event (TDE) because the TDE models matching the observed brightness changes have low event rates. Although it is not possible to determine AT 2023adya's nature based on the two-epoch single-band photometry alone, this discovery indicates that JWST can push the frontier of transient/variable science past $z$$=$5 and towards the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>The black hole - pair instability boundary for high stellar rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pair Instability (PI) boundary is crucial for understanding heavy merging Black Holes (BHs) and the second mass gap's role in galactic chemical evolution. So far, no works have critically and systematically examined how rotation and mass loss affect the PI boundary or BH masses below it. Rapid rotation significantly alters stellar structure and mass loss, which is expected to have significant effects on the evolution of stellar models. We have previously derived a critical core mass independent of stellar evolution parameters, finding the BH (Pulsational) PI boundary at $M_{ CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$ for a carbon-oxygen (CO) core. Using MESA, we model massive stars around the PI boundary for varying rotation rates and metallicities. We implement mechanical mass loss in MESA, studying its effects on massive stars in low-metallicity environments. Below $1/100$th $Z_\odot$, mechanical mass loss dominates over radiative winds. We check the BH-PI boundary for rapid rotators to confirm our critical core mass criterion and derive model fits describing rotation's impact on core and final masses. Fast rotators reach a point (typically $\Omega / \Omega_{crit} \approx 0.6$) where the entire star becomes chemically homogeneous, evolving like a stripped star. This lowers the maximum BH mass before PI to its critical core mass of $M_{CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$, aligning with the bump feature in the BH mass distribution observed by LIGO/VIRGO.</description>

Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3) contains a wealth of information to advance our knowledge of stellar physics. In these lecture notes we introduce the data products from GDR3 that can be exploited by the stellar physics community. Then we visit different regions of the HR diagram, discuss the open scientific questions, and describe how GDR3 can help advance this particular topic. Specific regions include hot OB and A type stars, FGK main sequence, giants, and variable sources, low mass stars, and ultra-cool dwarfs. Examples of scientific exploitation are also provided. These lecture notes are accompanied by a 3-hour lecture presentation and a 3-hour practical session that are publicly available on the website of the Ecole Evry Schatzman 2023: Stellar physics with Gaia, https://ees2023.sciencesconf.org/, see Lectures and Hands-on Work.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT discovers a jet-driven bow shock near GRS 1915+105. How an invisible large-scale jet sculpts a microquasar's environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes, both supermassive and stellar-mass, impact the evolution of their surroundings on a large range of scales. While the role of supermassive black holes is well studied, the effects of stellar-mass black holes on their surroundings, particularly in inducing structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), remain under explored.
  This study focuses on the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, renowned for its active jets, and the primary aim is to unveil and characterise the impact of GRS 1915+105 on its environment by identifying structures induced by jet-ISM interaction. Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total exposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to date. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we inferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into the jet-ISM interaction site.
  Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely induced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity in the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\,cm$^{-3}$ while assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\,K, which implies a bow shock expansion velocity of $20\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}&lt;\dot{L} &lt;\,360\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$. We estimate that the jet responsible for the formation of the bow shock has an age between 0.09 and 0.22 Myr, and the time-averaged energy rate Conclusions: Our results confirm that in stellar-mass black holes, the energy dissipated through jets can be comparable to the accretion energy, and through the interaction of the jet with the ISM, such energy is transferred back to the environment.
  This feedback mechanism mirrors the powerful influence of supermassive black holes on their environments, underscoring the significant role a black hole's activity has in shaping its surroundings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nearby (d=3.6 Mpc) starburst galaxy M82 has been studied for several decades by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) networks such as e-MERLIN and the European VLBI Network (EVN). The numerous supernova remnants (SNRs), HII regions and other exotic transients make it a perfect laboratory for studying stellar evolution and the interstellar medium (ISM). Its proximity provides a linear resolution of 17 pc/arcsec, enabling decadal-time-scale variability and morphology studies of the tens of compact radio sources. In this proceedings, we describe new techniques developed in the last ten years that provide deeper, more robust imaging, enable in-band spectral index mapping, and allow wider fields of view to be imaged to find new radio sources.</description>

      <title>A non-uniform metal distribution in the ram-pressure stripped M86 group of galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot halos has primarily been studied in closed-box galaxy clusters. Investigating the metal content of lower-mass, open systems can serve as a valuable tracer for understanding their dynamical history and the extent of chemical enrichment mechanisms in the Universe. In this context, we use an 85.6 ks XMM-Newton observation to study the spatial distribution of the abundance ratios of Mg, Si, and S with respect to Fe in the hot gas of the ram-pressure-stripped M86, which has undergone morphological transformations. We report that the chemical composition in the M86 galaxy core is more similar to the rest of the hot gaseous content of the Universe than to its stellar population. This result indicate that even extreme supersonic ram-pressure is insufficient to strip the inner part of a galaxy of its hot atmosphere. Comparison with other galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping suggests that stripping the "primordial" atmosphere of a galaxy requires a combination of ram-pressure stripping and strong radio-mechanical AGN activity. The X-ray emission structures within M86, the plume and the tail, are found to be relatively isothermal. We observe that the Mg/Fe ratio in the plume is $3.3\sigma$ higher than in the M86 galaxy core and is consistent with that in the M86 group outskirts and the Virgo ICM, suggesting that the plume might originate from the low-entropy group gas due to a galaxy-galaxy collision rather than from the ram-pressure stripping of the dense galaxy core.</description>

      <title>Model Choice Matters for Age Inference on the Red Giant Branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic archaeology relies on accurate stellar parameters to reconstruct the galaxy's history, including information on stellar ages. While the precision of data has improved significantly in recent years, stellar models used for age inference have not improved at a similar rate. In fact, different models yield notably different age predictions for the same observational data. In this paper, we assess the difference in age predictions of various widely used model grids for stars along the red giant branch. Using open source software, we conduct a comparison of four different evolution grids and we find that age estimations become less reliable if stellar mass is not known, with differences occasionally exceeding $80\%$. Additionally, we note significant disagreements in the models' age estimations at non-solar metallicity. Finally, we present a method for including theoretical uncertainties from stellar evolutionary tracks in age inferences of red giants, aimed at improving the accuracy of age estimation techniques used in the galactic archaeology community.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of blue stragglers in $\omega$ Centauri: the case of five double-mode radial SX Phoenicis pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first extensive seismic modelling of SX Phe stars in the stellar system $\omega$ Cen. First, using the new values of reddening $E(B-V)$ and distance modulus $(m-M)_V$, and bolometric corrections from Kurucz model atmospheres, we determine the effective temperatures and luminosities of all SX Phe variables in $\omega$ Cen with available $(B-V)$ colours. Next, we carefully select SX Phe stars that have a frequency ratio strongly suggesting excitation of two radial modes, and, in addition, their preliminary pulsational models have the values of $(T_{\rm eff},~ L)$ consistent with observational determinations. For five double-mode radial pulsators, we perform an extensive seismic modeling using the Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations. We study the effect of opacity tables and helium abundance. With the OPAL data and $Y=0.30$, we obtained masses in the range (1.0,~1.2) M$_{\odot}$, metallicity $Z\in(0.0007,~0.0029)$ and the age of about (1.9,~3.8) Gyr. The OP and OPLIB seismic models have always higher metallicites, sometimes outside the allowed range for $\omega$ Cen. In the case of three stars, we find seismic models within the observed range of $(T_{\rm eff},~L)$ with all three opacity tables. In the case of two stars, with the highest metallicity, seismic models computed with the OP and OPLIB tables are located far outside the observed error box. The OPAL seismic models follow the age$-$metallicity relation known for $\omega$ Cen from the literature.</description>

      <title>lenscat: a Public and Community-Contributed Catalog of Known Strong Gravitational Lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present lenscat, a public and community-contributed catalog of strong gravitational lenses found by electromagnetic surveys. The main objective of lenscat is to compile a simple, easy-to-access catalog that can be used in a variety of lensing studies, such as facilitating the search for the host galaxy of a candidate strongly lensed transient event. We also provide a python package to interact with tools commonly used by the community. This allows end users both with and without lensing expertise to obtain a list of known strong lenses within a given search area, and to also rank them by their respective searched probabilities. Here, we exemplify this by crossmatching the gravitational wave joint sky localization region of an interesting pair of events GW170104-GW170814. Other examples with short gamma-ray bursts are given. Thanks to the open and simple infrastructure of lenscat, members of the lensing community can directly add newly found lenses from their own studies to help create a long-lasting catalog that is as exhaustive and accessible as possible.</description>

Abstract: Context. Green valley (GV) galaxies are objects defined on a colour-magnitude diagram, or a colour-mass diagram, as being associated with a transition from a star-forming to a quiescent state (quenching), or vice versa (rejuvenation). Aims. We studied the sub-millimetre emission of galaxies in the GV and linked it with their physical evolutionary properties. Methods. We exploited a semi-analytic model (SAM) for galaxy evolution that includes a detailed treatment of dust production and evolution in galactic contexts. We modelled the observational properties of simulated galaxies by post-processing the SAM catalogues with the spectral synthesis and radiative transfer code GRASIL. Results. Our model produces a clear bimodality (and thus a GV) in the colour-mass diagram, although some tensions arise when compared to observations. After introducing a new criterion for identifying the GV in any dataset, we find that GV galaxies, at fixed stellar mass, have $250 \mu$m luminosities approximately half those of blue galaxies, while red galaxies exhibit luminosities of up to an order of magnitude lower. While specific star formation rates drop sharply during quenching, the dust content remains relatively high during the GV transition, powering sub-millimetre emission. Rejuvenating galaxies in the GV, which were previously red, have experienced a star formation burst that shifts their colour to green, but their $S_{250\, \mu \rm m}$ fluxes remain low due to their still low dust masses. Conclusions. Our galaxy evolution model highlights the delay between star formation and dust evolution, showing that sub-millimetre emission is not always a safe indicator of star formation activity, with quenching (rejuvenating) GV galaxies featuring relatively high (low) sub-millimetre emission.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence and the invisible Universe: Subradiance as a dark matter mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16663v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum entanglement and coherence in suppressing radiation and explore its implications for dark matter. Using Dicke's framework, we demonstrate that entangled states in a gas at thermal equilibrium can lead to subradiance, trapping energy in dark quantum states and reducing radiation intensity. Applying this to the 21 cm line in dark matter halos, we find that quantum coherence renders the gas effectively dark. Moreover, entanglement results in a vanishing collision cross-section, consistent with the collisionless nature of dark matter observed in systems like the bullet cluster. We also show that absorption of incident radiation can exceed levels predicted by Beer's law, which holds only in the absence of coherence. These findings suggest that quantum entanglement and coherence may explain the non-luminous behavior of matter in dark matter halos, offering a novel perspective on dark matter and advancing the understanding of astrophysical radiative processes.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey: XXVII. The extremely metal-poor stream C-19 stretches over more than 100 degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the most metal-poor stream, C-19, provides us with a fossil record of a stellar structure born very soon after the Big Bang. In this work, we search for new C-19 members over the whole sky by combining two complementary stream-searching algorithms, STREAMFINDER and StarGO,, and utilizing low-metallicity star samples from the Pristine survey as well as Gaia BP/RP spectro-photometric catalogues. We confirm twelve new members, spread over more than 100$^\circ$, using velocity and metallicity information from a set of spectroscopic follow-up programs that targeted a quasi-complete sample of our bright candidates ($G \lesssim 16.0$). From the updated set of stream members, we confirm that the stream is wide, with a stream width of $\sim200$ pc, and dynamically hot, with a derived velocity dispersion of $10.9^{+2.1}_{-1.5}$ km/s. The tension remains between these quantities and a purely baryonic scenario in which the relatively low-mass stream (even updated to a few $10^4M_{\odot}$) stems from a globular cluster progenitor, as suggested by its chemical abundances. Some heating mechanism, such as preheating of the cluster in its own dark matter halo or through interactions with halo sub-structures appears necessary to explain the tension. The impact of binaries on the measured dispersion also remains unknown. Detailed elemental abundances of more stream members as well as multi-epoch radial velocities from spectroscopic observations are therefore crucial to fully understand the nature and past history of the most metal-poor stream of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>FEASTS Combined with Interferometry. III. The Low Column Density HI Around M51 and Possibility of Turbulent-mixing Gas Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a new joint-deconvolution pipeline, we combine the single-dish and interferometric atomic hydrogen (HI) data of M51 observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) (FEASTS program) and the Very Large Array (VLA) (THINGS). The product data cube has a typical line width of $13\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and a $2\sigma$ line-of-sight (LOS) sensitivity of HI column density $N_\text{HI}\sim3.2\times10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ at a spatial resolution of ${\sim}18''$ (${\sim}0.7\,\text{kpc}$). Among the HI-detected LOSs extending to ${\sim}50\,\text{kpc}$, ${\sim}89\%$ consist of diffuse HI only, which is missed by previous VLA observations. The distribution of dense HI is reproduced by previous hydrodynamical simulations of this system, but the diffuse component is not, likely due to unresolved physics related to the interaction between the circumgalactic and interstellar media. With simple models, we find that these low-$N_\text{HI}$ structures could survive the background ultraviolet photoionization, but are susceptible to the thermal evaporation. We find a positive correlation between LOS velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and $N_\text{HI}$ with a logarithmic index of ${\sim}0.5$. Based on existing turbulent mixing layer (TML) theories and simulations, we propose a scenario of hot gas cooling and accreting onto the disk through a TML, which could reproduce the observed power index of ${\sim}0.5$. We estimate the related cooling and accretion rates to be roughly one-third to two-thirds of the star-formation rate. A typical column density of diffuse HI (${\sim}10^{19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) can be accreted within $300\,\text{Myr}$, the interaction time scale previously estimated for the system. Such a gas accretion channel has been overlooked before, and may be important for gas-rich interacting systems and for high redshift galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A High-Caliber View of the Bullet Cluster Through JWST Strong and Weak Lensing Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) is a key astrophysical laboratory for studying dark matter, galaxy cluster mergers, and shock propagation in extreme environments. Using new JWST imaging, we present the highest-resolution mass reconstruction to date, combining 146 strong lensing constraints from 37 systems with high-density (398 sources arcmin$^{-2}$) weak lensing data, without assuming that light traces mass. The main cluster's mass distribution is highly elongated (NW-SE) and consists of at least three subclumps aligned with the brightest cluster galaxies. The subcluster is more compact but elongated along the E-W direction, with a single dominant peak. We also detect a possible mass and ICL trail extending from the subcluster's eastern side toward the main cluster. Notably, these detailed features are closely traced by the intracluster light, with a modified Hausdorff distance of $19.80 \pm 12.46$ kpc. Together with multi-wavelength data, the complex mass distribution suggests that the merger history of the Bullet Cluster may be more complex than previous binary cluster merger scenarios.</description>

      <title>Line Intensity Mapping Prediction from the Cosmic Dawn (CoDa) III Simulation for H$\alpha$ from Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium during the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of large-scale structure, galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) can be probed by upcoming Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiments, which sample in redshift and direction without needing to resolve individual galaxies. We predict the intensity and sources of hydrogen H$\alpha$ emission, dominated by radiative recombination following ionization by UV from the same massive stars that caused reionization, down to redshift 4.6, using the largest fully-coupled, radiation-hydro simulation of galaxy formation and reionization to date, Cosmic Dawn (CoDa) III. We compute the mean intensity and Voxel Intensity Distribution (VID) vs. redshift, including the relative contributions of galaxies and IGM. This will provide mock data to guide and interpret LIM experiments such as NASA's SPHEREx and proposed Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM).</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Clusters from Gaia DR2 as Galactic PeVatrons: I -- Expected Gamma-ray and Neutrino Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young &amp; massive stellar clusters (SCs) are a potential source of galactic cosmic rays up to very high energies as a result of two possible acceleration scenarios. Collective stellar winds from massive member stars form a wind-blown bubble with a termination shock at which particle acceleration to PeV energies may occur. Furthermore, shock acceleration may occur at SNRs expanding inside the bubble. By applying a model of cosmic ray acceleration at both the wind termination shock and SNR shocks to the catalog of known SCs derived from Gaia DR2, we aim to identify the most promising targets to search for evidence of PeVatron activity. Predictions for the secondary fluxes of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are derived based on particle acceleration at the collective wind TS and the subsequent hadro-nuclear interactions with the surrounding medium. Predictions from our modelling under baseline and optimistic scenarios are compared to data, finding consistent results. We estimate the detection prospects for future gamma-ray and neutrino experiments. We find that degree-scale angular sizes of the wind-blown bubbles are typical, that may pose a challenge for experimental detection. A shortlist of the most promising candidates is identified, with an anticipated flux range. Of order 10 SCs may be detectable with future facilities, and 1-3 could be currently operating as PeVatrons. Among these, three gamma-ray detected SCs have data that our model can consistently describe. Several further as-yet-undetected SCs offer promising targets for future observations, although the flux range allowed by our model can be large (&gt; factor 10). The large angular size of the wind-blown bubble may lead to low surface brightness emission, worsening the problem of source confusion. Nevertheless, we discuss how further work will help to constrain SCs as PeVatron candidates. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses - axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics - based on Airy function approximations - which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius - as it is in electromagnetic lensing - making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>Are Kronberger 80 and/or Kronberger 82 regions PeVatron candidates for LHAASO J2108+5157?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays have been detected in the region of LHAASO~J2108+5157 by the Fermi--LAT, HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observatories. Cygnus~OB2 in Cygnus--X has been confirmed as the first strong stellar cluster PeVatron in our Galaxy. Thus, the star--forming regions Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82, located in the field of LHAASO~J2108+5157, are analyzed to evaluate their stellar population and potential as associated PeVatron candidates. A distance of 10~kpc is adopted for Kronberger~80, while $\sim$1.6~kpc is estimated for Kronberger~82. Based on stellar densities, we report that their cluster radii are 2.5$\arcmin$ and 2.0$\arcmin$, while IR photometry reveals poor stellar content in massive O-type stars in both cases. From optical data, the estimation of cluster ages are 5--12.6~Myr and $\lesssim$ 5~Myr, respectively. We conclude that, in contrast to the stellar content of Cygnus~OB2, it is unlikely that Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82 are PeVatrons associated with LHAASO~J2108+5157. The presence of a PeVatron in this region remains a mystery, but we confirm that the two Kronberger regions are star--forming regions undergoing formation rather than evolution.</description>
