      <title>Photonic chip for visible interferometry: laboratory characterization and comparison with the theoretical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated optics are used to achieve astronomical interferometry inside robust and compact materials, improving the instruments stability and sensitivity. In order to perform differential phase measurements at the H$\alpha$ line (656.3 nm) with the 600-800 nm spectro-interferometer FIRST, a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) is being developed. This PIC performs the visible combination of the beams coming from the telescope pupil sub-apertures. In this work, TEEM Photonics waveguides fabricated by $K_+:Na_+$ ion exchange in glass are characterized in terms of single-mode range and mode field diameter. The waveguide diffused index profile is modeled on Beamprop software. FIRST beam combiner building blocks are simulated, especially achromatic directional couplers and passive $\pi/2$ phase shifters for a potential ABCD interferometric combination.</description>

      <title>Progress towards an array-wide diffuse UHE neutrino search with the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino experiment at the South Pole. ARA aims to detect the radio emissions from neutrino-induced particle showers using in-ice clusters of antennas buried ${\sim}200$ m deep on a roughly cubical lattice with side length of ${\sim}10$ m. ARA has five such independent stations which have collectively accumulated ${\sim}30$ station-years of livetime through 2023. The fifth station of ARA has an additional sub-detector, known as the phased array, which pioneered an interferometric trigger constructed by beamforming the signals of $7$ tightly packed, vertically-polarized antennas. This scheme has been demonstrated to significantly improve the trigger efficiency for low SNR signals. In this talk, we will present the current state of the first array-wide diffuse neutrino search using $24$ station-years of data (through 2021). We anticipate that this analysis will result in the first UHE neutrino observation or world-leading limits from a radio neutrino detector below $100$ EeV. Additionally, this analysis will demonstrate the feasibility for multi-station in-ice radio arrays to successfully conduct an array-wide neutrino search -- paving the way for future, large detector arrays such as RNO-G and IceCube-Gen2 Radio.</description>

      <title>The carbon footprint of astronomical observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The carbon footprint of astronomical research is an increasingly topical issue. From a comparison of existing literature, we infer an annual per capita carbon footprint of several tens of tonnes of CO$_2$ equivalents for an average person working in astronomy. Astronomical observatories contribute significantly to the carbon footprint of astronomy, and we examine the related sources of greenhouse gas emissions as well as lever arms for their reduction. Comparison with other scientific domains illustrates that astronomy is not the only field that needs to accomplish significant carbon footprint reductions of their research facilities. We show that limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C or 2{\deg}C implies greenhouse gas emission reductions that can only be reached by a systemic change of astronomical research activities, and we argue that a new narrative for doing astronomical research is needed if we want to keep our planet habitable.</description>

      <title>What trade-off for astronomy between greenhouse gas emissions and the societal benefits? A sociological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The threat posed to humanity by global warming has led scientists to question the nature of their activities and the need to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from research. Until now, most studies have aimed at quantifying the carbon footprints and relatively less works have addressed the ways GHG emissions can be significantly reduced. A factor two reduction by 2030 implies to think beyond increases in the efficacy of current processes, which will have a limited effect, and beyond wishful thinking about large new sources of energy. Hence, choices among research questions or allocated means within a given field will be needed. They can be made in light of the perceived societal utility of research activities. Here, we addressed the question of how scientists perceive the impact of GHG reduction on their discipline and a possible trade-off between the societal utility of their discipline and an acceptable level of GHG emissions. We conducted 28 semi-directive interviews of French astrophysicists from different laboratories. Our most important findings are that, for most researchers, astronomy is considered to have a positive societal impact mainly regarding education but also because of the fascination it exerts on at least a fraction of the general public. Technological applications are also mentioned but with relatively less emphasis. The reduction of GHG emissions is believed to be necessary and most often reductions within the private-sphere have been achieved. However, the question of community-wide reductions in astrophysics research, and in particular the possible reductions of large facilities reveals much more contrasted opinions.</description>

      <title>CLOWN: The PASO cloud detection for optimization of automatic optical surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbiting space objects have become in the last decade a major nuisance impacting ground astronomy and orbiting space assets, from observatories to satellites and space stations. In particular with the rise of the satellite population in Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), space objects are becoming an even bigger threat and a strong problem to astronomical observations. To tackle these threats several coordinated surveillance networks composed of dedicated sensors (telescopes, radars and laser ranging facilities) track and survey space objects, from debris to active satellites. As part of the European Space Surveillance \&amp; Tracking (EU-SST) network, Portugal is developing the PAmpilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO), with both radio and optical telescopes dedicated to the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) domain, deployed at a Dark Sky destination. To optimize telescope survey time, we developed {\tt{CLOWN}} (CLOud Watcher at Night), an application interface that automatically monitors clouds in real time. This software can correctly trace clouds positions in the sky, provides accurate pointing information to the observation planning of the optical telescope to avoid cloudy areas. {\tt{CLOWN}} only requires the use of an all-sky camera, which is already a norm in observatories with optical telescopes and can be used with any camera, including those for which no information about its model specification do exist. {\tt{CLOWN}} does not require great computing power and it does not require the installation of additional equipment. {\tt{CLOWN}} results are very promising and confirm that the app can correctly identify clouds in a variety of different conditions and cloud types.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the performance of two C-RED ONE cameras for implementation in RISTRETTO and SAXO+ projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the near-infrared wavelength regime, atmospheric turbulence fluctuates at a scale of a few milliseconds, and its precise control requires the use of extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems equipped with fast and sensitive detectors operating at kHz speeds. The C-RED One cameras developed by First Light Imaging (FLI), based on SAPHIRA detectors made of HgCdTe e-APD array sensitive to 0.8-2.5 $\mu$m light, featuring a 320x256 pixels with 24 $\mu$m pitch, offering sub-electron readout noise and the ability to read subarrays, at frame-rates of up to few 10-kHz, are state-of-the-art for XAO wavefront sensing. The Observatory of Geneva purchased two C-RED One cameras identified as necessary for RISTRETTO (a proposed high-contrast high-resolution spectrograph for the VLT) and SAXO+ (an upgrade of the VLT/SPHERE XAO system) projects. We present a comprehensive characterization and comparative analysis of both the cameras. We present test results examining key noise contributors, including readout noise, detector bias, etc. And we also study their temporal variability. Additionally, we assess the conversion gain and the avalanche gain calibration of the detector. We also study the evolution some of these parameters over time.</description>

      <title>RISTRETTO: a comparative performance analysis of the unmodulated Pyramid wavefront sensor and the Zernike wavefront sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RISTRETTO instrument, a proposed visible high-contrast, high-resolution spectrograph for the VLT, has the primary science goal of detecting reflected light from nearby exoplanets and characterizing their atmospheres. Specifically, it aims to atmospherically characterize Proxima b, our closest temperate rocky exoplanet, located $37 mas$ from its host star, corresponding to $2\lambda/D$ at $\lambda=750 nm$. To achieve this goal, a raw contrast of less than $10^{-4}$ at $2\lambda/D$ and a Strehl ratio greater than 70% are required, necessitating an extreme adaptive optics system (XAO) for the spectrograph. To meet the performance requirements for RISTRETTO, high sensitivity to low-order wavefront aberrations and petal modes is essential. Therefore, unmodulated Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFS) and Zernike wavefront sensors (ZWFS) are under consideration. However, these sensors exhibit non-linearities and have a limited dynamic range, requiring different strategies to optimize their performance. The dynamic range of the sensors increases at longer wavelengths. Thus, in this study, we compare the performance of the 3-sided unmodulated PWFS, the 4-sided unmodulated PWFS, and the Zerniike WFS at different wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared regime.</description>

      <title>Design and Test of Small Mirror Supports for Harsh Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wavefront quality demands tighten on space systems for applications such as astronomy and laser communication, mounting small optics such that the wavefront is undisturbed, positioning is adjustable and the design is producible, while surviving harsh space environments, is a continuing challenge. We designed multiple candidate flexure mounts to support small optics (up to 50 mm diameter, and over 100 grams) to survive the qualification and acceptance tests of small spacecraft and units as defined in ISO 19683 and a mounting structure which is adjustable in decenter [+/-0.5mm], tip/tilt +/-0.5deg, and piston [+/-0.25mm]. We will present design details along with measurements showing less than approximately lambda/10 wavefront contribution from the optic bonding process, along with thermal and multi-axis vibration test data showing the mounted optics survived the acceptance testing loads and are suitable for operation in a wide range of harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Biases in Exoplanet Transmission Spectra Introduced by Limb Darkening Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main endeavors of the field of exoplanetary sciences is the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres on a population level. The current method of choice to accomplish this task is transmission spectroscopy, where the apparent radius of a transiting exoplanet is measured at multiple wavelengths in search of atomic and molecular absorption features produced by the upper atmosphere constituents. To extract the planetary radius from a transit light curve, it is necessary to account for the decrease in luminosity away from the center of the projected stellar disk, known as the limb darkening. Physically-motivated parametrizations of the limb darkening, in particular of the quadratic form, are commonly used in exoplanet transit light-curve fitting. Here, we show that such parametrizations can introduce significant wavelength-dependent biases in the transmission spectra currently obtained with all instrument modes of the JWST, and thus have the potential to affect atmospheric inferences. To avoid such biases, we recommend the use of standard limb-darkening parametrizations with wide uninformative priors that allow for non-physical stellar intensity profiles in the transit fits, and thus for a complete and symmetrical exploration of the parameter space. We further find that fitting the light curves at the native resolution results in errors on the measured transit depths that are significantly smaller compared to light curves that are binned in wavelength before fitting, thus potentially maximizing the amount of information that can be extracted from the data.</description>

      <title>AI forecasting of higher-order wave modes of spinning binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-inspired transformer model that predicts the non-linear dynamics of higher-order wave modes emitted by quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers. The model forecasts the waveform evolution from the pre-merger phase through the ringdown, starting with an input time-series spanning $ t \in [-5000\textrm{M}, -100\textrm{M}) $. The merger event, defined as the peak amplitude of waveforms that include the $l = |m| = 2$ modes, occurs at $ t = 0\textrm{M} $. The transformer then generates predictions over the time range $ t \in [-100\textrm{M}, 130\textrm{M}] $. We produced training, evaluation and test sets using the NRHybSur3dq8 model, considering a signal manifold defined by mass ratios $ q \in [1, 8] $; spin components $ s^z_{\{1,2\}} \in [-0.8, 0.8] $; modes up to $l \leq 4$, including the $(5,5)$ mode but excluding the $(4,0)$ and $(4,1)$ modes; and inclination angles $\theta \in [0, \pi]$. We trained the model on 14,440,761 waveforms, completing the training in 15 hours using 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the Delta supercomputer. We used 4 H100 GPUs in the DeltaAI supercomputer to compute, within 7 hours, the overlap between ground truth and predicted waveforms using a test set of 840,000 waveforms, finding that the mean and median overlaps over the test set are 0.996 and 0.997, respectively. Additionally, we conducted interpretability studies to elucidate the waveform features utilized by our transformer model to produce accurate predictions. The scientific software used for this work is released with this manuscript.</description>

      <title>STAR NRE: Solving supernova selection effects with set-based truncated auto-regressive neural ratio estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accounting for selection effects in supernova type Ia (SN Ia) cosmology is crucial for unbiased cosmological parameter inference -- even more so for the next generation of large, mostly photometric-only surveys. The conventional "bias correction" procedure has a built-in systematic bias towards the fiducial model used to derive it and fails to account for the additional Eddington bias that arises in the presence of significant redshift uncertainty. On the other hand, Bayesian hierarchical models scale poorly with the data set size and require explicit assumptions for the selection function that may be inaccurate or contrived. To address these limitations, we introduce STAR NRE, a simulation-based approach that makes use of a conditioned deep set neural network and combines efficient high-dimensional global inference with subsampling-based truncation in order to scale to very large survey sizes while training on sets with varying cardinality. Applying it to a simplified SN Ia model consisting of standardised brightnesses and redshifts with Gaussian uncertainties and a selection procedure based on the expected LSST sensitivity, we demonstrate precise and unbiased inference of cosmological parameters and the redshift evolution of the volumetric SN Ia rate from ~100 000 mock SNae Ia. Our inference procedure can incorporate arbitrarily complex selection criteria, including transient classification, in the forward simulator and be applied to complex data like light curves. We outline these and other steps aimed at integrating STAR NRE into an end-to-end simulation-based pipeline for the analysis of future photometric-only SN Ia data.</description>

      <title>Searching for Additional Planets in TESS Multi-Planet Systems: Testing Empirical Models Based on Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-planet system architectures are frequently used to constrain possible formation and evolutionary pathways of observed exoplanets. Therefore, understanding the predictive and descriptive power of empirical models of these systems is critical to understanding their formation histories. Additionally, if empirical models can reproduce architectures over a range of scales, transit and radial velocity observations can be more easily and effectively used to inform future microlensing, astrometric, and direct imaging surveys. We analyze 52 TESS multi-planet systems previously studied using Dynamite (Dietrich &amp; Apai 2020), who used TESS data alongside empirical models based on Kepler planets to predict additional planets in each system. We analyze additional TESS data to search for these predicted planets. We thereby evaluate the degree to which these models can be used to predict planets in TESS multi-planet systems. Specifically, we study whether a period ratio method or clustered period model is more predictive. We find that the period ratio model predictions are most consistent with the planets discovered since 2020, accounting for detection sensitivity. However, neither model is highly predictive, highlighting the need for additional data and nuanced models to describe the full population. Improved eccentricity and dynamical stability prescriptions incorporated into Dynamite provide a modest improvement in the prediction accuracy. We also find that the current sample of 183 TESS multi-planet systems are are highly dynamically packed, and appear truncated relative to detection biases. These attributes are consistent with the Kepler sample, and suggest a highly efficient formation process.</description>

Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>A hybrid approach to generating diatomic line lists for high resolution studies of exoplanets and other hot astronomical objects: Updates to ExoMol MgO, TiO and VO line lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The best molecular line lists for astrophysical applications today require both high accuracy of line positions for strong lines as well as high overall completeness. The former is required to enable, for example, molecular detection in high-resolution cross-correlation observations of exoplanets, while completeness is required for accurate spectroscopic and radiative properties over broad temperature and spectral ranges. The use of empirical energies generated with the Marvel procedure is a standard way to improve accuracy; here we explore methods of extending the use of these levels using predicted shifts and isotopologue extrapolation, as well augmenting the levels from other sources such as effective Hamiltonian studies. These methods are used to update ExoMol line lists for the main 24Mg16O and 48Ti16O isotopologues, as well as for 24Mg17O, 24Mg18O, 25Mg16O, 26Mg16O, 46Ti16O, 47Ti16O, 49Ti16O and 50Ti16O; new Marvel results for 51V16O are also presented</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>First studies on cascaded dual-phase liquid hole-multipliers in xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Challenges in scaling up noble-liquid time projection chambers prompted the exploration of new detection concepts. The liquid hole-multiplier (LHM) was introduced as a potential component, enabling the detection of ionization electrons and VUV photons. Prior studies focused on perforated electrodes coated with CsI immersed in the liquid and electroluminescence amplification produced on a bubble trapped underneath. However, the performance was hindered by electron transfer across the liquid-gas interface. Here, we explored a bubble-free variant, placing a CsI-coated Thick Gas Electron Multiplier electrode below the liquid-gas interface to improve the transfer efficiency across it. Results show &gt;5-fold improvement in the S1'/S2 ratio (a proxy for the photon detection efficiency (PDE)) compared to the bubble-assisted LHM. Although the achieved PDE is still below expectation ($\sim$4%), we propose potential improvements to enhance the performance of this detector.</description>

      <title>Reliable Detections of Atmospheres on Rocky Exoplanets with Photometric JWST Phase Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of different types of atmospheres and surfaces on rocky planets is one of the major questions in exoplanet astronomy, but there are currently no published unambiguous detections of atmospheres on any rocky exoplanets. The MIRI instrument on JWST can measure thermal emission from tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting small, cool stars. This emission is a function of their surface and atmospheric properties, potentially allowing the detection of atmospheres. One technique is to measure day-side emission to search for lower thermal emission than expected for a black-body planet due to atmospheric absorption features. Another technique is to measure phase curves of thermal emission to search for night-side emission due to atmospheric heat redistribution. In this work we compare strategies for detecting atmospheres on rocky exoplanets using these techniques. We simulate secondary eclipse and phase curve observations in the MIRI F1500W and F1280W filters, for a range of surfaces and atmospheres on thirty exoplanets selected for their F1500W signal-to-noise ratio. Our results show that secondary eclipse observations are highly degenerate between surfaces and atmospheres, given the wide range of potential surface albedos. We also show that thick atmospheres can support emission consistent with a black-body planet in these filters. These two results make it difficult to unambiguously detect or rule out atmospheres using their photometric day-side emission, except in a subset of CO$_{2}$-dominated atmospheres. We suggest that an F1500W phase curve could instead be observed for a similar sample of planets, allowing the unambiguous detection of atmospheres by night-side emission.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum dynamics as a scalable solution to the exoplanet opacity challenge: A case study of CO$_2$ in hydrogen atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, \citet{Niraula2022} pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this Letter, we introduce an end-to-end solution from ab initio calculations to pressure broadening, and use the perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\sim$10\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ presents a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily driven by the observation of gas giants) at $\sim$4.3$\mu$m and yet severely lack opacity data. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$ ~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements. Our proof-of-concept introduces a computationally affordable way to compute full-dimensional interaction potentials and scattering quantum dynamics with a precision sufficient to reduce the model-limited biases originating from the pressure broadening and thus support instrument-limited science with JWST and future missions.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. The authors now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Utilisation of ChatGPT in Scientific Publications in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in the capabilities of machine learning approaches in natural language processing has culminated in the rise of large language models over the last two years. Recent works have shown unprecedented adoption of these for academic writing, especially in some fields, but their pervasiveness in astronomy has not been studied sufficiently. To remedy this, we extract words that ChatGPT uses more often than humans when generating academic text and search a total of 1 million articles for them. This way, we assess the frequency of word occurrence in published works in astronomy tracked by the NASA Astrophysics Data System since 2000. We then perform a statistical analysis of the occurrences. We identify a list of words favoured by ChatGPT and find a statistically significant increase for these words against a control group in 2024, which matches the trend in other disciplines. These results suggest a widespread adoption of these models in the writing of astronomy papers. We encourage organisations, publishers, and researchers to work together to identify ethical and pragmatic guidelines to maximise the benefits of these systems while maintaining scientific rigour.</description>

      <title>mochi_class: Modelling Optimisation to Compute Horndeski In class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce mochi_class, an extension of the Einstein-Boltzmann solver hi_class, designed to unlock the full phenomenological potential of Horndeski gravity. This extension allows for general input functions of time without the need for hard-coded parametrisations or covariant Lagrangians. By replacing the traditional $\alpha$-parametrisation with a set of stable basis functions, mochi_class ensures that the resulting effective theories are inherently free from gradient and ghost instabilities. Additionally, mochi_class features a quasi-static approximation implemented at the level of modified metric potentials, enhancing prediction accuracy, especially for models transitioning between a super- and sub-Compton regime. mochi_class can robustly handle a wide range of models without fine-tuning, and introduces a new approximation scheme that activates modifications to the standard cosmology deep in the matter-dominated era. Furthermore, it incorporates viability conditions on the equation of motion for the scalar field fluctuations, aiding in the identification of numerical instabilities. Through comprehensive validation against other Einstein-Boltzmann solvers, mochi_class demonstrates excellent performance and accuracy, broadening the scope of hi_class by facilitating the study of specific modified gravity models and enabling exploration of previously inaccessible regions of the Horndeski landscape. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/mcataneo/mochi_class_public</description>
