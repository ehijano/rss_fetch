      <title>Removing quasiconformal orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that generic continuous linear cocycles over shifts and other zero-dimensional systems admit no quasiconformal orbits, thus providing a partial answer to a question of Nassiri, Rajabzadeh, and Reshadat. The proof relies on a new result about towers for homeomorphisms of zero-dimensional spaces, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Behavior of Linear Nonautonomous Advanced and Delayed Impulsive Differential Equations with Discontinuous Deviating Arguments via Difference Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions to guarantee the oscillatory and non-oscillatory behavior of solutions to nonautonomous advanced and delayed linear differential equations with piecewise constant arguments: \[ x'(t) = a(t)x(t) + b(t)x([t \pm k]), \] where $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $k \geq 1$, in both impulsive and non-impulsive cases (DEPCA and IDEPCA). Due to the hybrid nature of these systems, our approach draws on results from the theory of advanced and delayed linear difference equations. The analysis encompasses various types of differential equations with deviating arguments, many of which have been previously studied as special cases.</description>

      <title>Almost reducibility, distortion and local perfection for diffeomorphisms of one-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize the distortion elements of the group of smooth diffeomorphisms of the circle and of the group of compactly supported smooth diffeomorphisms of the real line. More precisely, we prove that, in this context, an element is distorted if and only if it is almost reducible, that is if and only if it has conjugates arbitrarily close to an isometry. For diffeomorphisms with fixed points, we show that this is equivalent to being the time-1 map of a C 1 vector field without hyperbolic zero. The equivalence between distortion and almost reducibility relies on new more general results about distortion elements in groups of diffeomorphisms of manifolds and on a new local perfection result for the group of compactly supported smooth diffeomorphisms of the real line.</description>

      <title>Identification and Computation of Slow Manifolds Using the Isostable Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman analysis can be used to understand the dynamics of a nonlinear dynamical system in terms a linear, but generally infinite dimensional operator. The isostable coordinate system focuses on the slowest decaying principal Koopman eigenmodes. This work leverages the isostable coordinate framework in the identification of slow manifolds for dynamical systems with fixed point attractors, defined as surfaces for which the fastest decaying isostable coordinates are zero. Numerical challenges associated with separation between fast and slow timescales necessitate the development of new computational approaches to identify these slow manifolds. Two such strategies are developed which approximate backward-time solutions on the slow manifold starting near the fixed point and extending far beyond the linear regime. Application to a variety of examples illustrates the utility of these methods and their potential use for model order reduction purposes.</description>

      <title>Markov matrix perturbations to optimize dynamical and entropy functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important problem in applied dynamical systems is to compute the external forcing that provokes the largest response of a desired observable quantity. For this, we investigate the perturbation theory of Markov matrices in connection with linear response theory in statistical physics. We use perturbative expansions to derive linear algorithms to optimize physically relevant quantities such as: entropy, Kullback-Liebler-divergence and entropy production of Markov matrices and their related probability vectors. These optimization algorithms are applied to Markov chain representations of discrete and continuous flows in and out of equilibrium. We consider Markov matrix representations originating from Ulam-type approximations of transfer operators and a reduced order model of a turbulent flow based on unstable periodic orbits theory. We also propose a numerical protocol to recast matrix perturbations into vector field perturbations. The results allow to physically interpret the obtained optimizing perturbations without knowledge of the underlying equations, in a data-driven way.</description>

      <title>Density of finitely supported invariant measures for automorphisms of compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of invariant measures for continuous automorphisms of compact metrizable abelian groups satisfying the descending chain condition. We show that the finitely supported invariant measures are weak-* dense in the space of all invariant probability measures, and that if the system is ergodic with respect to Haar measure, then the finitely supported ergodic invariant measures are also dense. A key ingredient in the proof is a variant of the specification property, which we establish for the ergodic systems in this class. Our results also yield the following two consequences: first, that every finitely generated group that is a semidirect product of $\mathbb{Z}$ with a countable abelian group $G$ is Hilbert-Schmidt stable; and second, a Livshitz-type theorem characterizing the uniform closure of coboundaries arising from continuous functions in terms of vanishing on periodic orbits. We also construct an example showing that, in general dynamical systems, the property of having dense finitely supported invariant measures does not pass to product systems.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent avoids strict saddles with a simple line-search method too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that gradient descent (GD) on a $C^2$ cost function generically avoids strict saddle points when using a small, constant step size. However, no such guarantee existed for GD with a line-search method. We provide one for a modified version of the standard Armijo backtracking method with generic, arbitrarily large initial step size. In contrast to previous works, our analysis does not require a globally Lipschitz gradient.
  We extend this to the Riemannian setting (RGD), assuming the retraction is real analytic (though the cost function still only needs to be $C^2$). In closing, we also improve guarantees for RGD with a constant step size in some scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.04027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a "tremor" deformation on strata of translation surfaces. Using it, we give new examples of behaviors of horocycle flow orbits in strata of translation surfaces. In the genus two stratum with two singular points, we find orbits which are generic for a measure whose support is strictly contained in the orbit and find orbits which are not generic for any measure. We also describe a horocycle orbit-closure whose Hausdorff dimension is not an integer.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of random billiards in a tube, where reflection angles at collisions with the boundary of the tube are random variables rather than deterministic (and elastic) quantities. We obtain a (non-standard) Central Limit Theorem for the horizontal displacement of a particle, which marginally fails to have a second moment w.r.t.\ the invariant measure of the random billiard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general approach to establish the Central Limit Theorem with error bounds for sequential dynamical systems. The main tool we develop is the application to this setting of a projective metric on complex cones, following the ideas introduced by Rugh and Dubois. To demonstrate the power of the proposed setting, we apply it to both sequential expanding maps, where similar results are known, and to sequential dispersing billiards, for which no such results are currently known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mixing properties of a class of nonuniformly expanding maps when the return time to the basis has a weak moment of order p &gt;1, up to a slowly varying function. From these computations, we deduce an invariance principle in H{\"o}lder spaces for the partial sum process of Birkhoff sums of H{\"o}lder continuous observables. The results apply to a class of intermittent maps of the unit interval. For such a map, we also prove that the H{\"o}lder invariance principle remains true for BV observables.</description>

Abstract: Under natural assumptions on the observable, we prove a Central Limit Theorem, a Berry-Esseen Theorem, and a quantitative Local Limit Theorem for a broad class of partially hyperbolic endomorphisms of the two-dimensional torus. Our results apply, but are not limited to, skew-products and their perturbations, and they remain valid even when the system admits multiple, though finitely many, absolutely continuous ergodic invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Spherical and Planar Ball Bearings -- a Study of Integrable Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonholonomic systems of $n$ homogeneous balls $\mathbf B_1,\dots,\mathbf B_n$ with the same radius $r$ that are rolling without slipping about a fixed sphere $\mathbf S_0$ with center $O$ and radius $R$. In addition, it is assumed that a dynamically nonsymmetric sphere $\mathbf S$ with the center that coincides with the center $O$ of the fixed sphere $\mathbf S_0$ rolls without slipping in contact to the moving balls $\mathbf B_1,\dots,\mathbf B_n$. The problem is considered in four different configurations. We derive the equations of motion and prove that these systems possess an invariant measure. As the main result, for $n=1$ we found two cases that are integrable in quadratures according to the Euler-Jacobi theorem. The obtained integrable nonholonomic models are natural extensions of the well-known Chaplygin ball integrable problems. Further, we explicitly integrate the planar problem consisting of $n$ homogeneous balls of the same radius, but with different masses, that roll without slipping over a fixed plane $\Sigma_0$ with a plane $\Sigma$ that moves without slipping over these balls.</description>

      <title>Closed Orbits of Dynamically Convex Reeb Flows: Towards the HZ- and Multiplicity Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the multiplicity problem for prime closed orbits of dynamically convex Reeb flows on the boundary of a star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The first of our two main results asserts that such a flow has at least $n$ prime closed Reeb orbits, improving the previously known lower bound by a factor of two and settling a long-standing open question. The second main theorem is that when, in addition, the domain is centrally symmetric and the Reeb flow is non-degenerate, the flow has either exactly $n$ or infinitely many prime closed orbits. This is a higher-dimensional contact variant of Franks' celebrated $2$-or-infinity theorem and, viewed from the symplectic dynamics perspective, settles a particular case of the contact Hofer-Zehnder conjecture. The proofs are based on several auxiliary results of independent interest on the structure of the filtered symplectic homology and the properties of closed orbits.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>
