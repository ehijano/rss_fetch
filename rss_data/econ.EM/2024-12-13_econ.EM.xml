      <title>Panel Stochastic Frontier Models with Latent Group Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic frontier models have attracted significant interest over the years due to their unique feature of including a distinct inefficiency term alongside the usual error term. To effectively separate these two components, strong distributional assumptions are often necessary. To overcome this limitation, numerous studies have sought to relax or generalize these models for more robust estimation. In line with these efforts, we introduce a latent group structure that accommodates heterogeneity across firms, addressing not only the stochastic frontiers but also the distribution of the inefficiency term. This framework accounts for the distinctive features of stochastic frontier models, and we propose a practical estimation procedure to implement it. Simulation studies demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method, which is further illustrated through an application to study the cost efficiency of the U.S. commercial banking sector.</description>

      <title>A Kernel Score Perspective on Forecast Disagreement and the Linear Pool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variance of a linearly combined forecast distribution (or linear pool) consists of two components: The average variance of the component distributions (`average uncertainty'), and the average squared difference between the components' means and the pool's mean (`disagreement'). This paper shows that similar decompositions hold for a class of uncertainty measures that can be constructed as entropy functions of kernel scores. The latter are a rich family of scoring rules that covers point and distribution forecasts for univariate and multivariate, discrete and continuous settings. The results in this paper are useful for two reasons. First, they provide a generic description of the uncertainty implicit in the linear pool. Second, they suggest principled measures of forecast disagreement in a wide range of applied settings.</description>

      <title>The Global Carbon Budget as a cointegrated system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Global Carbon Budget, maintained by the Global Carbon Project, summarizes Earth's global carbon cycle through four annual time series beginning in 1959: atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations, anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions, and CO$_2$ uptake by land and ocean. We analyze these four time series as a multivariate (cointegrated) system. Statistical tests show that the four time series are cointegrated with rank three and identify anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions as the single stochastic trend driving the nonstationary dynamics of the system. The three cointegrated relations correspond to the physical relations that the sinks are linearly related to atmospheric concentrations and that the change in concentrations equals emissions minus the combined uptake by land and ocean. Furthermore, likelihood ratio tests show that a parametrically restricted error-correction model that embodies these physical relations and accounts for the El-Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation cannot be rejected on the data. Finally, projections based on this model, using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios, yield results consistent with established climate science.</description>

      <title>Geometric Deep Learning for Realized Covariance Matrix Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods employed in matrix volatility forecasting often overlook the inherent Riemannian manifold structure of symmetric positive definite matrices, treating them as elements of Euclidean space, which can lead to suboptimal predictive performance. Moreover, they often struggle to handle high-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for forecasting realized covariance matrices of asset returns using a Riemannian-geometry-aware deep learning framework. In this way, we account for the geometric properties of the covariance matrices, including possible non-linear dynamics and efficient handling of high-dimensionality. Moreover, building upon a Fr\'echet sample mean of realized covariance matrices, we are able to extend the HAR model to the matrix-variate. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using daily realized covariance matrices for the 50 most capitalized companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, showing that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Linear estimation of average global effects</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the average causal effect of treating every member of a population, as opposed to none, using an experiment that treats only some. This is the policy-relevant estimand when deciding whether to scale up an intervention based on the results of an RCT, for example, but differs from the usual average treatment effect in the presence of spillovers. We consider both estimation and experimental design given a bound (parametrized by $\eta &gt; 0$) on the rate at which spillovers decay with the ``distance'' between units, defined in a generalized way to encompass spatial and quasi-spatial settings, e.g. where the economically relevant concept of distance is a gravity equation. Over all estimators linear in the outcomes and all cluster-randomized designs the optimal geometric rate of convergence is $n^{-\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{\eta}}}$, and this rate can be achieved using a generalized ``Scaling Clusters'' design that we provide. We then introduce the additional assumption, implicit in the OLS estimators used in recent applied studies, that potential outcomes are linear in population treatment assignments. These estimators are inconsistent for our estimand, but a refined OLS estimator is consistent and rate optimal, and performs better than IPW estimators when clusters must be small. Its finite-sample performance can be improved by incorporating prior information about the structure of spillovers. As a robust alternative to the linear approach we also provide a method to select estimator-design pairs that minimize a notion of worst-case risk when the data generating process is unknown. Finally, we provide asymptotically valid inference methods.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effect Estimators as Weighted Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimators that weight observed outcomes to form effect estimates have a long tradition. Their outcome weights are widely used in established procedures, such as checking covariate balance, characterizing target populations, or detecting and managing extreme weights. This paper introduces a general framework for deriving such outcome weights. It establishes when and how numerical equivalence between an original estimator representation as moment condition and a unique weighted representation can be obtained. The framework is applied to derive novel outcome weights for the six seminal instances of double machine learning and generalized random forests, while recovering existing results for other estimators as special cases. The analysis highlights that implementation choices determine (i) the availability of outcome weights and (ii) their properties. Notably, standard implementations of partially linear regression-based estimators, like causal forests, employ outcome weights that do not sum to (minus) one in the (un)treated group, not fulfilling a property often considered desirable.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation and Inference for Categorical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there is a rich literature on robust methodologies for contamination in continuously distributed data, contamination in categorical data is largely overlooked. This is regrettable because many datasets are categorical and oftentimes suffer from contamination. Examples include inattentive responding and bot responses in questionnaires or zero-inflated count data. We propose a novel class of contamination-robust estimators of models for categorical data, coined $C$-estimators (``$C$'' for categorical). We show that the countable and possibly finite sample space of categorical data results in non-standard theoretical properties. Notably, in contrast to classic robustness theory, $C$-estimators can be simultaneously robust \textit{and} fully efficient at the postulated model. In addition, a certain particularly robust specification fails to be asymptotically Gaussian at the postulated model, but is asymptotically Gaussian in the presence of contamination. We furthermore propose a diagnostic test to identify categorical outliers and demonstrate the enhanced robustness of $C$-estimators in a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Potential Outcomes and Causal Mixture Identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous data from multiple populations, sub-groups, or sources is often represented as a ``mixture model'' with a single latent class influencing all of the observed covariates. Heterogeneity can be resolved at multiple levels by grouping populations according to different notions of similarity. This paper proposes grouping with respect to the causal response of an intervention or perturbation on the system. This definition is distinct from previous notions, such as similar covariate values (e.g. clustering) or similar correlations between covariates (e.g. Gaussian mixture models). To solve the problem, we ``synthetically sample'' from a counterfactual distribution using higher-order multi-linear moments of the observable data. To understand how these ``causal mixtures'' fit in with more classical notions, we develop a hierarchy of mixture identifiability.</description>
