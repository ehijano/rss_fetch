      <title>Solving Zebra Puzzles Using Constraint-Guided Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research has enhanced the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve logic puzzles using techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting or introducing a symbolic representation. These frameworks are still usually insufficient to solve complicated logical problems, such as Zebra puzzles, due to the inherent complexity of translating natural language clues into logical statements. We introduce a multi-agent system, ZPS, that integrates LLMs with an off the shelf theorem prover. This system tackles the complex puzzle-solving task by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, generating SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) code to solve them with a theorem prover, and using feedback between the agents to repeatedly improve their answers. We also introduce an automated grid puzzle grader to assess the correctness of our puzzle solutions and show that the automated grader is reliable by evaluating it in a user-study. Our approach shows improvement in all three LLMs we tested, with GPT-4 showing 166% improvement in the number of fully correct solutions.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cumulative Changes and Attractors in Iterated Cultural Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Player Potential Game Approach for Sensor Network Localization with Noisy Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor network localization (SNL) is a challenging problem due to its inherent non-convexity and the effects of noise in inter-node ranging measurements and anchor node position. We formulate a non-convex SNL problem as a multi-player non-convex potential game and investigate the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE) in both the ideal setting without measurement noise and the practical setting with measurement noise. We first show that the NE exists and is unique in the noiseless case, and corresponds to the precise network localization. Then, we study the SNL for the case with errors affecting the anchor node position and the inter-node distance measurements. Specifically, we establish that in case these errors are sufficiently small, the NE exists and is unique. It is shown that the NE is an approximate solution to the SNL problem, and that the position errors can be quantified accordingly. Based on these findings, we apply the results to case studies involving only inter-node distance measurement errors and only anchor position information inaccuracies.</description>

Abstract: Social identities play an important role in the dynamics of human societies, and it can be argued that some sense of identification with a larger cause or idea plays a critical role in making humans act responsibly. Often social activists strive to get populations to identify with some cause or notion -- like green energy, diversity, etc. in order to bring about desired social changes. We explore the problem of designing computational models for social identities in the context of autonomous AI agents. For this, we propose an agent model that enables agents to identify with certain notions and show how this affects collective outcomes. We also contrast between associations of identity with rational preferences. The proposed model is simulated in an application context of urban mobility, where we show how changes in social identity affect mobility patterns and collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>VITAMIN: A Compositional Framework for Model Checking of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The verification of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) poses a significant challenge. Various approaches and methodologies exist to address this challenge; however, tools that support them are not always readily available. Even when such tools are accessible, they tend to be hard-coded, lacking in compositionality, and challenging to use due to a steep learning curve. In this paper, we introduce a methodology designed for the formal verification of MAS in a modular and versatile manner, along with an initial prototype, that we named VITAMIN. Unlike existing verification methodologies and frameworks for MAS, VITAMIN is constructed for easy extension to accommodate various logics (for specifying the properties to verify) and models (for determining on what to verify such properties).</description>

      <title>Ariadne and Theseus: Exploration and Rendezvous with Two Mobile Agents in an Unknown Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two fundamental problems in mobile computing: exploration and rendezvous, with two distinct mobile agents in an unknown graph. The agents may communicate by reading and writing information on whiteboards that are located at all nodes. They both move along one adjacent edge at every time-step. In the exploration problem, the agents start from the same arbitrary node and must traverse all the edges. We present an algorithm achieving collective exploration in $m$ time-steps, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph. This improves over the guarantee of depth-first search, which requires $2m$ time-steps. In the rendezvous problem, the agents start from different nodes of the graph and must meet as fast as possible. We present an algorithm guaranteeing rendezvous in at most $\frac{3}{2}m$ time-steps. This improves over the so-called `wait for Mommy' algorithm which is based on depth-first search and which also requires $2m$ time-steps. Importantly, all our guarantees are derived from a more general asynchronous setting in which the speeds of the agents are controlled by an adversary at all times. Our guarantees generalize to weighted graphs, when replacing the number of edges $m$ with the sum of all edge lengths. We show that our guarantees are met with matching lower-bounds in the asynchronous setting.</description>

      <title>JointPPO: Diving Deeper into the Effectiveness of PPO in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has become the prevailing paradigm in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it may not be suitable for scenarios in which agents can fully communicate and share observations with each other. Fully centralized methods, also know as Centralized Training with Centralized Execution (CTCE) methods, can fully utilize observations of all the agents by treating the entire system as a single agent. However, traditional CTCE methods suffer from scalability issues due to the exponential growth of the joint action space. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose JointPPO, a CTCE method that uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to directly optimize the joint policy of the multi-agent system. JointPPO decomposes the joint policy into conditional probabilities, transforming the decision-making process into a sequence generation task. A Transformer-based joint policy network is constructed, trained with a PPO loss tailored for the joint policy. JointPPO effectively handles a large joint action space and extends PPO to multi-agent setting in a clear and concise manner. Extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) testbed demonstrate the superiority of JointPPO over strong baselines. Ablation experiments and analyses are conducted to explores the factors influencing JointPPO's performance.</description>

      <title>BenchMARL: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is currently facing a reproducibility crisis. While solutions for standardized reporting have been proposed to address the issue, we still lack a benchmarking tool that enables standardization and reproducibility, while leveraging cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations. In this paper, we introduce BenchMARL, the first MARL training library created to enable standardized benchmarking across different algorithms, models, and environments. BenchMARL uses TorchRL as its backend, granting it high performance and maintained state-of-the-art implementations while addressing the broad community of MARL PyTorch users. Its design enables systematic configuration and reporting, thus allowing users to create and run complex benchmarks from simple one-line inputs. BenchMARL is open-sourced on GitHub: https://github.com/facebookresearch/BenchMARL</description>

      <title>A Semantic-Aware Multiple Access Scheme for Distributed, Dynamic 6G-Based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the semantic-aware paradigm presents opportunities for innovative services, especially in the context of 6G-based applications. Although significant progress has been made in semantic extraction techniques, the incorporation of semantic information into resource allocation decision-making is still in its early stages, lacking consideration of the requirements and characteristics of future systems. In response, this paper introduces a novel formulation for the problem of multiple access to the wireless spectrum. It aims to optimize the utilization-fairness trade-off, using the $\alpha$-fairness metric, while accounting for user data correlation by introducing the concepts of self- and assisted throughputs. Initially, the problem is analyzed to identify its optimal solution. Subsequently, a Semantic-Aware Multi-Agent Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning (SAMA-D3QL) technique is proposed. This method is grounded in Model-free Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL), enabling the user equipment to autonomously make decisions regarding wireless spectrum access based solely on their local individual observations. The efficiency of the proposed technique is evaluated through two scenarios: single-channel and multi-channel. The findings illustrate that, across a spectrum of $\alpha$ values, association matrices, and channels, SAMA-D3QL consistently outperforms alternative approaches. This establishes it as a promising candidate for facilitating the realization of future federated, dynamically evolving applications.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Dynamics of Identity and Fairness in Ultimatum Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allocation games are zero-sum games that model the distribution of resources among multiple agents. In this paper, we explore the interplay between an \textit{subjective identity} and its impact on notions of fairness in allocation. The sense of identity in agents is known to lead to responsible decision-making in non-cooperative, non-zero-sum games like Prisoners' Dilemma, and is a desirable feature to add into agent models. However, when it comes to allocation, the sense of identity can be shown to exacerbate inequities in allocation, giving no rational incentive for agents to act fairly towards one another. This lead us to introduce a sense of fairness as an innate characteristic of autonomous agency. For this, we implement the well-known Ultimatum Game between two agents, where their sense of identity association and their sense of fairness are both varied. We study the points at which agents find it no longer rational to identify with the other agent, and uphold their sense of fairness, and vice versa. Such a study also helps us discern the subtle difference between responsibility and fairness when it comes to autonomous agency.</description>

      <title>BonnBot-I Plus: A Bio-diversity Aware Precise Weed Management Robotic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the critical tasks of plant protection in arable farms, addressing a modern challenge in agriculture: integrating ecological considerations into the operational strategy of precision weeding robots like \bbot. This article presents the recent advancements in weed management algorithms and the real-world performance of \bbot\ at the University of Bonn's Klein-Altendorf campus. We present a novel Rolling-view observation model for the BonnBot-Is weed monitoring section which leads to an average absolute weeding performance enhancement of $3.4\%$. Furthermore, for the first time, we show how precision weeding robots could consider bio-diversity-aware concerns in challenging weeding scenarios. We carried out comprehensive weeding experiments in sugar-beet fields, covering both weed-only and mixed crop-weed situations, and introduced a new dataset compatible with precision weeding. Our real-field experiments revealed that our weeding approach is capable of handling diverse weed distributions, with a minimal loss of only $11.66\%$ attributable to intervention planning and $14.7\%$ to vision system limitations highlighting required improvements of the vision system.</description>

      <title>Phase-Bounded Broadcast Networks over Topologies of Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study networks of processes that all execute the same finite state protocol and that communicate through broadcasts. The processes are organized in a graph (a topology) and only the neighbors of a process in this graph can receive its broadcasts. The coverability problem asks, given a protocol and a state of the protocol, whether there is a topology for the processes such that one of them (at least) reaches the given state. This problem is undecidable. We study here an under-approximation of the problem where processes alternate a bounded number of times $k$ between phases of broadcasting and phases of receiving messages. We show that, if the problem remains undecidable when $k$ is greater than 6, it becomes decidable for $k=2$, and EXPSPACE-complete for $k=1$. Furthermore, we show that if we restrict ourselves to line topologies, the problem is in $P$ for $k=1$ and $k=2$.</description>
