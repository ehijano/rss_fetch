      <title>Torsion-free Modules over Commutative Domains of Krull Dimension One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a domain of Krull dimension one, we study when the class $\mathcal{F}$ of modules over $R$ that are arbitrary direct sums of finitely generated torsion-free modules is closed under direct summands.
  If $R$ is local, we show that $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under direct summands if and only if any indecomposable, finitely generated, torsion-free module has local endomorphism ring. If, in addition, $R$ is noetherian this is equivalent to say that the normalization of $R$ is a local ring.
  If $R$ is an $h$-local domain of Krull dimension $1$ and $\mathcal{F}_R$ is closed under direct summands, then the property is inherited by the localizations of $R$ at maximal ideals. Moreover, any localizations of $R$ at a maximal ideal, except maybe one, satisfies that any finitely generated ideal is $2$-generated. The converse is true when the domain $R$ is, in addition, integrally closed, or noetherian semilocal or noetherian with module-finite normalization.
  Finally, over a commutative domain of finite character and with no restriction on the Krull dimension, we show that the isomorphism classes of countable generated modules in $\mathcal{F}$ are determined by their genus.</description>

      <title>Norms, Normsets, and Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a development of norms and discuss their relationship to factorization. In earlier work, the first named author introduced the notion of a normset, which is the image of the norm map. A normset is a monoid with its own factorization properties. We discuss in several different environments the relationship between factoring in domains and their respective normsets. We will also discuss the utility of this notion when it comes to multiplicative ideal theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-quasisymmetric functions with semigroup exponents, Hopf algebras and Rota-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many years ago, G.-C.~Rota discovered a close connection between symmetric functions and Rota-Baxter algebras, and proposed to study generalizations of symmetric functions in the framework of Rota-Baxter algebras. Guided by this proposal, quasisymmetric functions from weak composition (instead of just compositions) were obtained from free Rota-Baxter algebras on one generator. This paper aims to generalize this approach to free Rota-Baxter algebras on multiple generators in order to obtain further generalizations of quasisymmetric functions. For this purpose and also for its independent interest, the space $\mathrm{MQSym}$ of quasisymmetric functions on multiple sequences of variables is defined, generalizing quasisymmetric functions and diagonally quasisymmetric functions of Aval, Bergeron and Bergeron. Linear bases of such multi-quasisymmetric functions are given by monomial multi-quasisymmetric functions and fundamental multi-quasisymmetric functions, the latter recover the fundamental $G^m$-quasisymmetric functions of Aval and Chapoton. Next introduced is the even more general notion of multi-quasisymmetric functions $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$ with exponents in a semigroup $E$, which also generalizes the quasisymmetric functions with semigroup exponents in a recent work. Through this approach, a natural Hopf algebraic structure is obtained on $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$. Finally, in support of Rota's proposal, the free commutative unitary Rota-Baxter algebra on a finite set is shown to be isomorphic to a scalar extension of $\mathrm{MQSym}^E$, a fact which in turn equips the free Rota-Baxter algebra with a Hopf algebra structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a dynamical theory as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the field of real numbers in constructive mathematics without axiom of dependent choice. We propose a theory which turns out to be very close to the theory of real closed local rings in classical mathematics. The theory of real closed rings is presented here in constructive form as a natural purely equational theory, which uses virtual root functions introduced in previous work. This work is also a first step through an essential goal for the future, which is to obtain a constructive version of o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>Pushforward monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a monad $T$ on $\mathcal{C}$ and a functor $G \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, one can construct a monad $G_\#T$ on $\mathcal{D}$ subject to the existence of a certain Kan extension; this is the pushforward of $T$ along $G$. We develop the general theory of this construction, and relate it to the concept of codensity monads, showing that each is a special case of the other. We study several examples of pushforwards, the most notable being that the pushforward of the powerset monad from finite sets to sets gives the theory of continuous lattices. We also identify the category of algebras of the codensity monad of the inclusion of fields into rings, which turns out to be the free product completion of the category of fields. Lastly, for a set $E$, we identify the category of algebras of the codensity monad of the $(\cdot) + E$ functor on sets.</description>

      <title>The $\text{v}$-function of powers of sums of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, $I\subset R=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $J\subset T=K[y_1,\dots,y_m]$ be graded ideals. Set $S=R\otimes_KT$ and let $L=IS+JS$. The behaviour of the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(L^k)$ in terms of the $\text{v}$-functions $\text{v}(I^k)$ and $\text{v}(J^k)$ is investigated. When $I$ and $J$ are monomial ideals, we describe $\text{v}(L^k)$, giving an explicit formula involving $\text{v}(I^k)$ and $\text{v}(J^k)$.</description>

      <title>Unexpected but recurrent phenomena for Quot and Hilbert schemes of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate some aspects of the geometry of two classical generalisations of the Hilbert schemes of points. Precisely, we show that parity conjecture for $\text{Quot}_r^d\mathbb{A}^3$ already fails for $d=8$ and $r=2$ and that lots of the elementary components of the nested Hilbert schemes of points on smooth quasi-projective varieties of dimension at least 4 are generically non-reduced. We also deduce that nested Hilbert schemes of points on smooth surfaces have generically non-reduced components. Finally, we give an infinite family of elementary components of the classical Hilbert schemes of points.</description>

      <title>Degrees of P-Grothendieck polynomials and regularity of Pfaffian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a formula for the degrees of Ikeda and Naruse's $P$-Grothendieck polynomials using combinatorics of shifted tableaux. We show this formula can be used in conjunction with results of Hamaker, Marberg, and Pawlowski to obtain an upper bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain Pfaffian varieties known as vexillary skew-symmetric matrix Schubert varieties. Similar combinatorics additionally yields a new formula for the degree of Grassmannian Grothendieck polynomials and the regularity of Grassmannian matrix Schubert varieties, complementing a 2021 formula of Rajchgot, Ren, Robichaux, St. Dizier, and Weigandt.</description>
