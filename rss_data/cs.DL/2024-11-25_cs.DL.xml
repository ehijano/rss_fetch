      <title>Does Open Access Foster Interdisciplinary Citation? Decomposing Open Access Citation Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of an open access (OA) citation advantage, that is, whether OA increases citations, has been a topic of interest for many years. Although numerous previous studies have focused on whether OA increases citations, expectations for OA go beyond that. One such expectation is the promotion of knowledge transfer across various fields. This study aimed to clarify whether OA, especially gold OA, increases interdisciplinary citations in various natural science fields. Specifically, we measured the effect of OA on interdisciplinary and within-discipline citation counts by decomposing an existing metric of the OA citation advantage. The results revealed that OA increases both interdisciplinary and within-discipline citations in many fields and increases only interdisciplinary citations in chemistry, computer science, and clinical medicine. Among these fields, clinical medicine tends to obtain more interdisciplinary citations without being influenced by specific journals or papers. The findings indicate that OA fosters knowledge transfer to different fields, which extends our understanding of its effects.</description>

      <title>Who is Funding Indian Research? A look at major funding sources acknowledged in Indian research papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science and scientific research activities, in addition to the involvement of the researchers, require resources like research infrastructure, materials and reagents, databases and computational tools, journal subscriptions and publication charges etc. In order to meet these requirements, researchers try to attract research funding from different funding sources, both intramural and extramural. Though some recent reports provide details of the amount of funding provided by different funding agencies in India, it is not known what quantum of research output resulted from such funding. This paper, therefore, attempts to quantify the research output produced with the funding provided by different funding agencies to Indian researchers. The major funding agencies that supported Indian research publications are identified and are further characterized in terms of being national or international, and public or private. The analytical results not only provide a quantitative estimate of funded research from India and the major funding agencies supporting the research, but also discusses the overall context of research funding in India, particularly in the context of upcoming operationalization of Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF).</description>

      <title>Indo-US Research Collaboration: strengthening or declining?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the importance of Indo-US research collaboration, it is intriguing to note that measurement and characterization of dynamics of Indo-US research collaboration is relatively underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we investigate major patterns in Indo-US collaboration with respect to certain key aspects using suitable scientometric notions and indicators. The research publication data for the last three decades (1990-2020) is obtained from Web of Science and analysed for the purpose. Results indicate an increase in absolute number of Indo-US collaborated papers over time, with an impressive share of about 1/3rd of India's total internationally collaborated research output. However, the proportionate share of Indo-US collaborated papers in India's internationally collaborated papers has declined over the time, as Indian researchers find new collaborating partners. Nevertheless, the collaboration with US is found to be highly rewarding in terms of citations and boost measures. Important insights and recommendations that may be helpful for shaping up new perspective on Indo-US collaboration policy are presented in this work.</description>

      <title>High-performance automated abstract screening with large language model ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks requiring processing and interpretation of input text. Abstract screening is a labour-intensive component of systematic review involving repetitive application of inclusion and exclusion criteria on a large volume of studies identified by a literature search. Here, LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama 3 70B, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 3.5) were trialled on systematic reviews in a full issue of the Cochrane Library to evaluate their accuracy in zero-shot binary classification for abstract screening. Trials over a subset of 800 records identified optimal prompting strategies and demonstrated superior performance of LLMs to human researchers in terms of sensitivity (LLM-max = 1.000, human-max = 0.775), precision (LLM-max = 0.927, human-max = 0.911), and balanced accuracy (LLM-max = 0.904, human-max = 0.865). The best performing LLM-prompt combinations were trialled across every replicated search result (n = 119,691), and exhibited consistent sensitivity (range 0.756-1.000) but diminished precision (range 0.004-0.096). 66 LLM-human and LLM-LLM ensembles exhibited perfect sensitivity with a maximal precision of 0.458, with less observed performance drop in larger trials. Significant variation in performance was observed between reviews, highlighting the importance of domain-specific validation before deployment. LLMs may reduce the human labour cost of systematic review with maintained or improved accuracy and sensitivity. Systematic review is the foundation of evidence synthesis across academic disciplines, including evidence-based medicine, and LLMs may increase the efficiency and quality of this mode of research.</description>
