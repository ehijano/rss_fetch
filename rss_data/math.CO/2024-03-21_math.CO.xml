      <title>Degree asymptotics of the numerical semigroup tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{numerical semigroup} is a subset $\Lambda$ of the nonnegative integers that is closed under addition, contains $0$, and omits only finitely many nonnegative integers (called the \emph{gaps} of $\Lambda$). The collection of all numerical semigroups may be visually represented by a tree of element removals, in which the children of a semigroup $\Lambda$ are formed by removing one element of $\Lambda$ that exceeds all existing gaps of $\Lambda$. In general, a semigroup may have many children or none at all, making it difficult to understand the number of semigroups at a given depth on the tree. We investigate the problem of estimating the number of semigroups at depth $g$ (i.e.\ of genus $g$) with $h$ children, showing that as $g$ becomes large, it tends to a proportion $\phi^{-h-2}$ of all numerical semigroups, where $\phi$ is the golden ratio.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walk is ballistic on graphs with more than one end</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that on any transitive graph $G$ with infinitely many ends, a self-avoiding walk of length $n$ is ballistic with extremely high probability, in the sense that there exist constants $c,t&gt;0$ such that $\mathbb{P}_n(d_G(w_0,w_n)\geq cn)\geq 1-e^{-tn}$ for every $n\geq 1$. Furthermore, we show that the number of self-avoiding walks of length $n$ grows asymptotically like $\mu_w^n$, in the sense that there exists $C&gt;0$ such that $\mu_w^n\leq c_n\leq C\mu_w^n$ for every $n\geq 1$. Our results extend more generally to quasi-transitive graphs with infinitely many ends, satisfying the additional technical property that there is a quasi-transitive group of automorphisms of $G$ which does not fix an end of $G$.</description>

      <title>Identifying codes in graphs of given maximum degree. I. Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An identifying code of a closed-twin-free graph $G$ is a dominating set $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that any two vertices in $G$ have a distinct intersection between their closed neighborhoods and $S$. It was conjectured that there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that for every connected graph $G$ of order $n$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, the graph $G$ admits an identifying code of size at most $( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} )n +c$. We provide significant support for this conjecture by proving that it holds for all trees. Moreover, our proof allows us to precisely determine the constant $c$ for trees, and the list of trees requiring $c&gt;0$. For $\Delta=2$ (the graph is a path or a cycle), it is long known that $c=3/2$ suffices. For trees, for each $\Delta\ge 3$, we show that $c=1/\Delta\le 1/3$ suffices and that $c$ is required to be a positive number only for a finite number of trees. In particular, for $\Delta = 3$, there are 12 trees with diameter at most $6$ with a positive constant $c$ and, for each $\Delta \ge 4$, the only tree with positive constant $c$ is the $\Delta$-star. Our proof is based on induction and utilizes recent results from [F. Foucaud, T. Lehtil\"a. Revisiting and improving upper bounds for identifying codes. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2022]. We also remark that there are infinitely many trees for which the bound is tight when $\Delta=3$; for every $\Delta\ge 4$, we construct an infinite family of trees of order $n$ with identification number very close to the bound, namely $\left( \frac{\Delta-1+\frac{1}{\Delta-2}}{\Delta+\frac{2}{\Delta-2}} \right) n &gt; (\frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} ) n -\frac{n}{\Delta^2}$.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sets in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\textit{resolving set}$ $R$ in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ is uniquely identified by its distances to the vertices of $R$. Introduced in the 1970s, this concept has been since then extensively studied from both combinatorial and algorithmic point of view. We propose a generalization of the concept of resolving sets to temporal graphs, i.e., graphs with edge sets that change over discrete time-steps. In this setting, the $\textit{temporal distance}$ from $u$ to $v$ is the earliest possible time-step at which a journey with strictly increasing time-steps on edges leaving $u$ reaches $v$, i.e., the first time-step at which $v$ could receive a message broadcast from $u$. A $\textit{temporal resolving set}$ of a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is a subset $R$ of its vertices such that every vertex of $\mathcal{G}$ is uniquely identified by its temporal distances from vertices of $R$.
  We study the problem of finding a minimum-size temporal resolving set, and show that it is NP-complete even on very restricted graph classes and with strong constraints on the time-steps: temporal complete graphs where every edge appears in either time-step 1 or 2, temporal trees where every edge appears in at most two consecutive time-steps, and even temporal subdivided stars where every edge appears in at most two (not necessarily consecutive) time-steps. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for temporal paths and temporal stars where every edge appears in exactly one time-step, and give a combinatorial analysis and algorithms for several temporal graph classes where the edges appear in periodic time-steps.</description>

      <title>String attractors and bi-infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String attractors are a combinatorial tool coming from the field of data compression. It is a set of positions within a word which intersects an occurrence of every factor. While one-sided infinite words admitting a finite string attractor are eventually periodic, the situation is different for two-sided infinite words. In this paper, we characterise the bi-infinite words admitting a finite string attractor as the characteristic Sturmian words and their morphic images. For words that do not admit finite string attractors, we study the structure and properties of their infinite string attractors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a proof of Ollinger's conjecture that the problem of tiling the plane with translated copies of a set of $8$ polyominoes is undecidable. The techniques employed in our proof include a different orientation for simulating the Wang tiles in polyomino and a new method for encoding the colors of Wang tiles.</description>

      <title>Extremal spectral radius of degree-based weighted adjacency matrices of graphs with given order and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $f$ adjacency matrix is a type of edge-weighted adjacency matrix, whose weight of an edge $ij$ is $f(d_i,d_j)$, where $f$ is a real symmetric function and $d_i,d_j$ are the degrees of vertex $i$ and vertex $j$. The $f$-spectral radius of a graph is the spectral radius of its $f$-adjacency matrix. In this paper, the effect of subdividing an edge on $f$-spectral radius is discussed. Some necessary conditions of the extremal graph with given order and size are derived. As an example, we obtain the bicyclic graph(s) with the smallest $f$-spectral radius for fixed order $n\geq8$ by applying generalized Lu-Man method.</description>

      <title>Graphs of large girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey on graphs of large girth consists of two parts. The first deals with some aspects of algebraic and extremal graph theory loosely related to the Moore bound. Our point of departure for the second, Ramsey theoretic, part are some constructions of graphs with large chromatic number and large girth; this will lead us to a discussion of the recent girth Ramsey theorem. Both parts can be enjoyed independently of each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PySymmPol is a Python package designed for efficient manipulation of symmetric polynomials. It provides functionalities for working with various types of symmetric polynomials, including elementary, homogeneous, monomial symmetric, (skew-) Schur, and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. In addition to polynomial operations, PySymmPol offers tools to explore key properties of integer partitions and Young diagrams, such as transposition, Frobenius coordinates, characters of symmetric groups and others.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-modal sequence is a sequence of real numbers that can be partitioned into $k+1$ (possibly empty) monotone sections such that adjacent sections have opposite monotonicities. For every positive integer $k$, we prove that any sequence of $n$ pairwise distinct real numbers contains a $k$-modal subsequence of length at least $\sqrt{(2k+1)(n-\frac14)} - \frac{k}{2}$, which is tight in a strong sense. This confirms an old conjecture of F.R.K.Chung (J.Combin.Theory Ser.A, 29(3):267-279, 1980).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $t$ and $n$ let $C_t^n$ be the $n$-cube over $t$ elements, that is, the set of ordered $n$-tuples over the alphabet $\{0,\dots, t-1\}$. We address the question of whether a balanced finite coloring of $C_t^n$ guarantees the presence of a rainbow geometric or combinatorial line. For every even $t\geq 4$ and every $n$, we provide a $\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)^n$--coloring of $C_t^n$ such that all color classes have the same size, and without rainbow combinatorial or geometric lines.</description>

      <title>Partitioning the projective plane to two incidence-rich parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An internal or friendly partition of a vertex set $V(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a partition to two nonempty sets $A\cup B$ such that every vertex has at least as many neighbours in its own class as in the other one. Motivated by Diwan's existence proof on internal partitions of graphs with high girth, we give constructive proofs for the existence of internal partitions in the incidence graph of projective planes and discuss its geometric properties. In addition, we determine exactly the maximum possible difference between the sizes of the neighbor set in its own class and the neighbor set of the other class, that can be attained for all vertices at the same time for the incidence graphs of desarguesian planes of square order.</description>

      <title>Degree conditions for Ramsey goodness of paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Chv\'atal implies that if $n \geq (r-1)(t-1) +1$, then any colouring of the edges of $K_n$ in red and blue contains either a monochromatic red $K_r$ or a monochromatic blue $P_t$. We study a natural generalization of his result, determining the exact minimum degree condition for a graph $G$ on $n = (r - 1)(t - 1) + 1$ vertices which guarantees that the same Ramsey property holds in $G$. In particular, using a slight generalization of a result of Haxell, we show that $\delta(G) \geq n - \lceil t/2 \rceil$ suffices, and that this bound is best possible. We also use a classical result of Bollob\'as, Erd\H{o}s, and Straus to prove a tight minimum degree condition in the case $r = 3$ for all $n \geq 2t - 1$.</description>

      <title>Moderate Deviations of Triangle Counts in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Random Graph $G(n,m)$: The Lower Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N_{\triangle}(G)$ be the number of triangles in a graph $G$. In [14] and [25] (respectively) the following bounds were proved on the lower tail behaviour of triangle counts in the dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G_m\sim G(n,m)$:
  \[ \mathbb{P}\big(N_{\triangle}(G_m) \, &lt; \, (1-\delta)\mathbb{E}[N_{\triangle}(G_m)]\big) \,=\,
  \exp\left(-\Theta\left(\delta^2n^3\right)\right) \qquad \text{if $n^{-3/2}\ll \delta\ll n^{-1}$} \] and \[
  \mathbb{P}\big(N_{\triangle}(G_m) \, &lt; \, (1-\delta)\mathbb{E}[N_{\triangle}(G_m)]\big) \,=\,
  \exp\left(-\Theta(\delta^{2/3}n^2) \right) \qquad \text{if $n^{-3/4} \ll \delta \ll 1$.}
  \]
  Neeman, Radin and Sadun [25] also conjectured that the probability should be of the form $\exp\left(-\Theta\left(\delta^2n^3\right)\right)$ in the "missing interval" $n^{-1}\ll \delta\ll n^{-3/4}$. We prove this conjecture.
  As part of our proof we also prove that some random graph statistics, related to degrees and codegrees, are normally distributed with high probability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By applying simplification operations to categories of multigraphs, several natural graph operations are shown to demonstrate categorical issues. The replacement of an undirected edge with a directed cycle for digraphs admits both a left and a right adjoint, while the analogous operation for quivers only admits a left adjoint. The clique-replacement graph, intersection graph, and dual hypergraph fail to be functorial with traditional graph homomorphisms. The three failures are remedied by considering weak set-system homomorphisms, which form a category isomorphic to both the category of incidence structures and a lax comma category.</description>

      <title>Paving Matroids: Defining Equations and Associated Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study paving matroids, their realization spaces, and their closures, along with matroid varieties and circuit varieties. Within this context, we introduce three distinct methods for generating polynomials within the associated ideals of these varieties across any dimension. Additionally, we explain the relationship between polynomials constructed using these different methods. We then compute a comprehensive and finite set of defining equations for matroid varieties associated with specific classes of paving matroids. Finally, we focus on the class of paving matroids of rank $3$, known as point-line configurations, which essentially contain simple matroids of rank $3$. Furthermore, we provide a decomposition for the associated circuit variety of point-line configurations, where all points have a degree less than $3$.

      <title>On the typical structure of graphs not containing a fixed vertex-critical subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the typical structure of sparse $H$-free graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain a subgraph isomorphic to a given graph $H$. Extending the seminal result of Osthus, Pr\"omel, and Taraz that addressed the case where $H$ is an odd cycle, Balogh, Morris, Samotij, and Warnke proved that, for every $r \ge 3$, the structure of a random $K_{r+1}$-free graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges undergoes a phase transition when $m$ crosses an explicit (sharp) threshold function $m_r(n)$. They conjectured that a similar threshold phenomenon occurs when $K_{r+1}$ is replaced by any strictly $2$-balanced, edge-critical graph $H$. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture. In fact, we prove that the structure of a typical $H$-free graph undergoes an analogous phase transition for every $H$ in a family of vertex-critical graphs that includes all edge-critical graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a planar embedding with list-assignment $L$ and outer cycle $C$, and let $P$ be a path of length at most four on $C$, where each vertex of $G\setminus C$ has a list of size at least five and each vertex of $C\setminus P$ has a list of size at least three. In this paper, we prove some results about partial $L$-colorings $\phi$ of $C$ with the property that any extension of $\phi$ to an $L$-coloring of $\textrm{dom}(\phi)\cup V(P)$ extends to $L$-color all of $G$. We use these results in a later sequence of papers to prove some results about list-colorings of high-representativity embeddings on surfaces.</description>

      <title>A logical limit law for $231$-avoiding permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the class of 231-avoiding permutations satisfies a logical limit law, i.e. that for any first-order sentence $\Psi$, in the language of two total orders, the probability $p_{n,\Psi}$ that a uniform random 231-avoiding permutation of size $n$ satisfies $\Psi$ admits a limit as $n$ is large. Moreover, we establish two further results about the behavior and value of $p_{n,\Psi}$: (i) it is either bounded away from $0$, or decays exponentially fast; (ii) the set of possible limits is dense in $[0,1]$. Our tools come mainly from analytic combinatorics and singularity analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f(n,p,q)$ denote the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of $K_n$ so that every copy of $K_p$ receives at least $q$ distinct colors. In this note, we show $\frac{6}{7}(n-1) \leq f(n,5,8) \leq n + o(n)$. The upper bound is proven using the "conflict-free hypergraph matchings method" which was recently used by Mubayi and Joos to prove $f(n,4,5) = \frac{5}{6}n + o(n)$.</description>

      <title>Ewald's Conjecture and integer points in algebraic and symplectic toric geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve several open problems concerning integer points of polytopes arising in symplectic and algebraic geometry. In this direction we give the first proof of a broad case of Ewald's Conjecture (1988) concerning symmetric integral points of monotone lattice polytopes in arbitrary dimension. We also include an asymptotic quantitative study of the set of points appearing in Ewald's Conjecture. Then we relate this work to the problem of displaceability of orbits in symplectic toric geometry. We conclude with a proof for the $2$-dimensional case, and for a number of cases in higher dimensions, of Nill's Conjecture (2009), which is a generalization of Ewald's conjecture to smooth lattice polytopes. Along the way the paper introduces two new classes of polytopes which arise naturally in the study of Ewald's Conjecture and symplectic displaceability: neat polytopes, which are related to Oda's Conjecture, and deeply monotone polytopes.</description>

      <title>A Note on Graph Burning of Path Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph burning is a natural discrete graph algorithm inspired by the spread of social contagion. Despite its simplicity, some open problems remain steadfastly unsolved, notably the burning number conjecture, which says that every connected graph of order $m^2$ has burning number at most $m$. Earlier, we showed that the conjecture also holds for a path forest, which is disconnected, provided each of its paths is sufficiently long. However, finding the least sufficient length for this to hold turns out to be nontrivial. In this note, we present our initial findings and conjectures that associate the problem to some naturally impossibly burnable path forests. It is noteworthy that our problem can be reformulated as a topic concerning sumset partition of integers.</description>

      <title>Designs in finite classical polar spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial designs have been studied for nearly 200 years. 50 years ago, Cameron, Delsarte, and Ray-Chaudhury started investigating their $q$-analogs, also known as subspace designs or designs over finite fields.
  Designs can be defined analogously in finite classical polar spaces, too. The definition includes the $m$-regular systems from projective geometry as the special case where the blocks are generators of the polar space. The first nontrivial such designs for $t &gt; 1$ were found by De Bruyn and Vanhove in 2012, and some more designs appeared recently in the PhD thesis of Lansdown.
  In this article, we investigate the theory of classical and subspace designs for applicability to designs in polar spaces, explicitly allowing arbitrary block dimensions. In this way, we obtain divisibility conditions on the parameters, derived and residual designs, intersection numbers and an analog of Fisher's inequality. We classify the parameters of symmetric designs. Furthermore, we conduct a computer search to construct designs of strength $t=2$, resulting in designs for more than 140 previously unknown parameter sets in various classical polar spaces over $\mathbb{F}_2$ and $\mathbb{F}_3$.</description>

      <title>Poset modules of the $0$-Hecke algebras and related quasisymmetric power sum expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Duchamp--Hivert--Thibon introduced the construction of a right $H_n(0)$-module, denoted as $M_P$, for any partial order $P$ on the set $[n]$. This module is defined by specifying a suitable action of $H_n(0)$ on the set of linear extensions of $P$. In this paper, we refer to this module as the poset module associated with $P$. Firstly, we show that $\bigoplus_{n \ge 0} G_0(\mathscr{P}(n))$ has a Hopf algebra structure that is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions, where $\mathscr{P}(n)$ is the full subcategory of $\textbf{mod-}H_n(0)$ whose objects are direct sums of finitely many isomorphic copies of poset modules and $G_0(\mathscr{P}(n))$ is the Grothendieck group of $\mathscr{P}(n)$. We also demonstrate how (anti-)automorphism twists interact with these modules, the induction product and restrictions. Secondly, we investigate the (type 1) quasisymmetric power sum expansion of some quasi-analogues $Y_\alpha$ of Schur functions, where $\alpha$ is a composition. We show that they can be expressed as the sum of the $P$-partition generating functions of specific posets, which allows us to utilize the result established by Liu--Weselcouch. Additionally, we provide a new algorithm for obtaining these posets. Using these findings, for the dual immaculate function and the extended Schur function, we express the coefficients appearing in the quasisymmetric power sum expansions in terms of border strip tableaux.</description>

      <title>Towards the Characterization of Terminal Cut Functions: a Condition for Laminar Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the following characterization problem. Given a set $T$ of terminals and a $(2^{|T|}-2)$-dimensional vector $\pi$ whose coordinates are indexed by proper subsets of $T$, is there a graph $G$ that contains $T$, such that for all subsets $\emptyset\subsetneq S\subsetneq T$, $\pi_S$ equals the value of the min-cut in $G$ separating $S$ from $T\setminus S$? The only known necessary conditions are submodularity and a special class of linear inequalities given by Chaudhuri, Subrahmanyam, Wagner and Zaroliagis.
  Our main result is a new class of linear inequalities concerning laminar families, that generalize all previous ones. Using our new class of inequalities, we can generalize Karger's approximate min-cut counting result to graphs with terminals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Additive one-weight codes over a finite field of non-prime order are equivalent to special subspace coverings of the points of projective space, which we call multispreads. The current paper is devoted to the characterization of the parameters of multispreads, which is equivalent to the characterization of the parameters of additive one-weight codes. We characterize these parameters for the case of the prime-square order of the field and make a partial characterization for the prime-cube case and the case of the fourth degree of a prime (including a complete characterization for orders 8, 27, and 16).</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the maximum parsimony tree for data with few substitutions within the NNI neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating species relationship trees, so-called phylogenetic trees, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated).
  On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present manuscript to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt; \frac{n}{8}+\frac{6}{5}-\frac{1}{10} \sqrt{\frac{5}{16} n^2+4}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;8 k-\frac{46}{5}+\frac{2}{5} \sqrt{40 k-31} $), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on a given tree $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively.</description>

      <title>Tournaments and random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between tournaments and random walks. This connection was observed by Moser, who conjectured that the number of score sequences $S_n\sim C4^n/n^{5/2}$. Winston and Kleitman came close to finding the correct order of $S_n$. Building on this, and subsequent works by Tak\'acs, Kim and Pittel confirmed that $S_n=\Theta(4^n/n^{5/2})$.
  In this work, we verify Moser's conjecture, using limit theory for integrated random walk bridges. Moreover, we show that $C$ can be described in terms of random walks. Combining this with a recent proof and alternative, number-theoretic description of $C$ by the second author, we obtain an analogue of Louchard's formula, for the Laplace transform of the squared Brownian excursion/Airy area measure. Finally, we describe the scaling limit of random score sequences, in terms of the Kolmogorov excursions, studied recently by B\"{a}r, Duraj and Wachtel.
  Our results can also be interpreted as answering questions related to a class of random polymers, which began with influential work of Sina\u{i}. From this point of view, our methods yield the precise asymptotics of a persistence probability, related to the pinning/wetting models from statistical physics, that was estimated up to constants by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, as conjectured by Caravenna and Deuschel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of random polymers, introduced by Sina\u{i}, which are related to persistence probabilities in integrated simple random walk bridges. We find the precise asymptotics of these probabilities, and describe their combinatorics, using limit theory for infinitely divisible distributions, and the number-theoretic subset counting formulas of von Sterneck from the early 1900s. Our results sharpen estimates by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, and respond to a conjecture of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the pinning/wetting models, for random linear chains exhibiting entropic repulsion. Our key combinatorial result is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula.</description>
