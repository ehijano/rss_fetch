      <title>A chemical avenue to manipulate field-reentrant superconducting rivalries in infinite layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a preliminary magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity manifested in high critical-temperature (Tc) Eu-doped infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, beyond analogous discoveries exclusively in low-Tc systems. This arises more intriguing fundamental issues about potential quantum-phase boundary and criticality between unconventional superconductivity and field-reentrant-one, which are inexplicable owing to formidable challenges in growing IL-nickelates towards later-series rare-earths. Herein, we demonstrate the 4f-orbital related quantum rivalries between high-Tc and reentrant superconductivity in (Nd1-yRE'y)1-xEuxNiO2 (RE': Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Dy) system, via opening up the chemical avenue for a quantum leap in their growths. Robust magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity with uniaxial anisotropy is validated to fringe at boundary of the superconducting dome with optimal-Tc near 40 K. Reinforced reentry is realized via introducing Gd3+ with half-filled deeper 4f-orbital energy-states, compared to Eu2+, that strengthens on-site magnetic-moment. Our findings largely enrich the superconducting phase-diagram for nickelates, establishing an ideal platform for studying 4f-related unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Anion-Free-Electron Duality and Enhanced Superconducting Role of Interstitial Anionic Electrons in Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconducting electrides, characterized by interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) residing in lattice cavities, has established a distinctive platform for investigating superconductors. Yet the superconducting origin and the fundamental role of IAEs in Cooper pairing formation remain poorly understood due to the challenges in directly observing IAEs. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we certify that the IAEs in electride La3In (Tc = 9.4 K) exhibit a dual nature as both anions and free electrons. With the finite-depth potential well model, we trace that IAEs originate from electronic states near the Fermi level located above potential barriers, forming a Fermi sea susceptible to scattering by La-derived phonons, triggering superconductivity. ARPES combined with high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples directly reveals IAEs' spatial distribution and energy dispersion from interstitial sites with the consistent energy value predicted by our theory model. The concomitant diminution of free electrons upon oxygen treatment, leading to a marked reduction in superconductivity, further provides compelling experimental evidence that IAEs actively participate in electron-phonon coupling. Our findings resolve the long-standing ambiguity regarding the electronic nature of IAEs, elucidate their enhancing superconductivity in the phonon-mediated mechanism, and provide a foundation for exploring advanced electride-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermally-controlled flux avalanche dynamics in bulk NbTi superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first direct visualization of flux avalanche propagation dynamics in bulk superconducting NbTi, tracking individual events and measuring their velocities using high-speed magneto-optical imaging. Unlike thin films with electromagnetic avalanches at km/s speeds, we observe velocities of 15--25 m/s, which are orders of magnitude slower. Analysis of characteristic timescales reveals that these avalanches are governed by local heating and limited heat dissipation through the adhesive layer, establishing a fundamentally different, thermally limited propagation regime. The threshold field for avalanche nucleation decreases with temperature, contrary to the increasing trend in thin films with efficient cooling - a behavior consistent with slow heat removal and thermal runaway in our system. All observed avalanches exhibit universal normalized velocity-distance scaling despite varying morphologies, confirming the robustness of thermal control. These findings reveal that bulk superconductors with poor thermal coupling operate in a previously uncharacterized avalanche regime, with direct implications for flux stability and quench protection in NbTi-based magnets, as well as a broader understanding of thermomagnetic instabilities in technological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials for Structural and Defect Properties of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials</description>

      <title>Correlations between superconducting and resistive anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are multiple possible origins of transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors. For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of near-EF van Hove singularity and in-gap topological Dirac surface states in superconducting electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting electrides have attracted growing attention for their potential to achieve high superconducting transition temperatures (TC) under pressure. However, many known electrides are chemically reactive and unstable, making high-quality single-crystal growth, characterization, and measurements difficult, and most do not exhibit superconductivity at ambient pressure. In contrast, La3In stands out for its ambient-pressure superconductivity (TC ~ 9.4 K) and the availability of high-quality single crystals. Here, we investigate its low-energy electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The bands near the Fermi energy are mainly derived from La 5d and In 5p orbitals. A saddle point is directly observed at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary, while a three-dimensional van Hove singularity crosses EF at the BZ corner. First-principles calculations further reveal topological Dirac surface states within the bulk energy gap above EF. The coexistence of a high density of states and in-gap topological surface states near EF suggests that La3In offers a promising platform for tuning superconductivity and exploring possible topological superconducting phases through doping or external pressure.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticle Dynamics in a MoRe-Based Superconducting Resonator under IR Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</description>

      <title>Coherent subgap transport in spin-split Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of subgap transport in ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor/insulator/superconductor junctions realized in EuS/Al/AlOx/Al vertical stacks. Differential conductance measurements reveal multiple Andreev reflection peaks, with odd-order peaks split by the spin-splitting induced in the superconductor adjacent to EuS, while even-order peaks remain unaffected. Combining experiments with quasiclassical transport modeling, we extract the spin-splitting and the distribution of transmission channels, finding that a significant fraction ($\sim 23\%$) of highly transparent channels ($\tau \approx 0.9$) dominates transport. The observation of a Josephson current further confirms strong superconducting coupling through these channels. Our results demonstrate that a single spin-split superconductor is sufficient to observe the even-odd MAR effect. Our work establishes EuS/Al junctions as a versatile platform to study subgap transport, Josephson coupling, and spin-polarized superconducting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Plasmon excitations and their attenuation in dirty superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $\omega(q)$ to the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $\omega(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with $\omega[q_c(T)] \approx 2\Delta(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.</description>

      <title>Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Single Qubit Gates through Multi-Photon Transition Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main enablers in quantum computing is having qubit control that is precise and fast. However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-pressure circuits are the circuit implementation of the cavity optomechanical Hamiltonian and discussed for qubit readout, low-frequency quantum photonics and dark matter axion detection. Due to the enormous design flexibility of superconducting circuits, photon-pressure systems provide fascinating possibilities to explore unusual parameter regimes of the optomechanical Hamiltonian. Here, we report the realization of a photon-pressure platform, in which a GHz circuit interacts with a MHz circuit via a magnetic-flux-tunable combination of dispersive and dissipative photon-pressure. In addition, both coupling rates are considerably enhanced by nonlinearities of the GHz-mode, which leads to the multi-photon coupling rates scaling stronger with the pump photon number $n_\mathrm{c}$ than the usual $\sqrt{n_\mathrm{c}}$ dependence. We demonstrate that interference of the two interaction paths leads to a Fano-like response in photon-pressure induced transparency, and that the dynamical backaction is considerably modified compared to the dispersive case, including a parametric instability caused by a red-detuned pump tone.</description>

      <title>Evidence for unexpectedly low quasiparticle generation rates across Josephson junctions of driven superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.</description>

      <title>Possible Liquid-Nitrogen-Temperature Superconductivity Driven by Perpendicular Electric Field in the Single-Bilayer Film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) is found in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ ultrathin film with critical temperature $T_c$ above the McMillan limit at ambient pressure (AP). It is eager to enhance $T_c$ of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. We propose that a perpendicular electric field strongly enhances $T_c$ in the single-bilayer film of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at AP. Under electric field, the layer with lower potential energy will accept electrons flowing from the other layer to fill in the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as the nearly half-filled Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital cannot accommodate more electrons. With the enhancement of the filling fraction in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in this layer, the interlayer $s$-wave pairing is suppressed, but the intralayer $d$-wave pairing in this layer is strongly enhanced. We numerically verify this idea and yield that an imposed voltage of about $0.1\sim0.2$ volt between layers is enough to realize liquid-nitrogen-temperature HTSC in this single bilayer at AP. Our results appeal for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of disordered planar Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect describes the property of a Josephson junction to have different values of the critical current for different direction of applied bias current and it is the focus of intense research thanks to the possible applications. The ubiquity of the effect experimentally reported calls for a study of the impact that disorder can have in the appearance of the effect. We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh--Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode in disordered superconductors, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity in dirty-limit superconductors can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the critical state in the ferromagnetic superconductor EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are very few materials in which ferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity due to the destructive effect of the magnetic exchange field on singlet Cooper pairs. The iron-based superconductor EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ is therefore unique in exhibiting robust superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature of 25 K and long-range ferromagnetism below $T_\mathrm{FM}\approx19$ K. Here we report a spatially-resolved study of the irreversible magnetisation in this system that reveals a variety of novel behaviours that are strongly linked with underlying ferromagnetic domain structures. In the superconducting-only state, hysteretic magnetisation due to irreversible vortex motion is consistent with typical weak vortex-pinning behaviour. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$, very narrowly-spaced stripe domains give rise to highly erratic and irreproducible fluctuations in the irreversible magnetisation that we attribute to the dynamics of multi-vortex clusters stabilised by the formation of vortex polarons. In contrast, at lower temperatures, ferromagnetic domains become wider and saturated with spontaneously nucleated vortices and antivortices, leading to a smoother but unconventional evolution of the irreversible state. This observation suggests that the penetrating flux front is roughened by the presence of the magnetic domains in this regime, presenting a clear departure from standard critical state models. Our findings indicate that the mechanism governing irreversibility is strongly influenced by the precise nature of the underlying ferromagnetic domains, being very sensitive to the specific material parameters of EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. We consider the possible microscopic origins of these effects, and suggest further ways to explore novel vortex-domain magnetic behaviours.</description>

      <title>Conventional and practical metallic superconductivity arising from repulsive Coulomb coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A concrete question is discussed: Can there be conventional s-wave superconductivity in regular 3D (or 2D) metals, i.e., electrons in a jellium background, interacting via the standard Coulomb coupling? We are interested in 'practical' SC that can in principle be observed in experiments, so the $T=0$ ground state being SC is not of interest, or for that matter a $T_c$ which is exponentially small and therefore 'impractical' is also not of interest in the current work. We discuss both 2D and 3D cases, focusing mostly on the 3D case. We find that almost any theory based on the BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg paradigm, with some form of screened Coulomb coupling replacing the electron-phonon coupling in the BCS or Eliashberg theory, would uncritically predict absurdly high $T_c\sim100$ K for s-wave SC in all metals (including the alkali metals, which are well-described by the jellium model) arising from the unavoidable fact that the Fermi, plasmon, and Coulomb potential energy scales are all $&gt;10^4$ K. Therefore, we conclude, based on reduction ad absurdum, that the violation of the venerable Migdal theorem in this problem is sufficiently disruptive that no significance can be attached to numerous existing theoretical publications in the literature claiming plasmon-induced (or other similar Coulomb coupling-induced) practical SC. Using a careful analysis of the Eliashberg gap equations we find that the $T_c$ of the 3D (or 2D) electron gas can be reduced well below $\sim1$ K depending on choices of frequency cut-off parameters that are introduced to satisfy Migdall's theorem but are apriori unknown. The only believable result is the one discovered 60 years ago by Kohn and Luttinger predicting non-s-wave SC arising from Friedel oscillations with exponentially low $T_c$. We provide several theoretical approaches using both BCS and Eliashberg theories and different screening models to make our point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the theoretical description of the role of quantum geometry in superfluidity and superconductivity of multiband systems, with focus on flat bands where quantum geometry is wholly responsible for supercurrents. This review differs from previous ones in that it is based on the most recent understanding of the theory: the dependence of the self-consistent order parameter on the supercurrent is properly taken into account, and the superfluid weight in a flat band becomes proportional to the minimal quantum metric. We provide a recap of basic quantum geometric quantities and the concept of superfluid density. The geometric contribution of superconductivity is introduced via considering the two-body problem. The superfluid weight of a multiband system is derived within mean-field theory, leading to a topological bound of flat band superconductivity. The physical interpretation of the flat band supercurrent in terms of Wannier function overlaps is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have observed superconductivity proximate to the nu = -2/3 fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator in twisted MoTe2. A critical open question is whether the underlying normal state is a Fermi liquid with a large Fermi surface or a strongly correlated metal with low carrier density. In this work, we develop a theory of the phases emerging from doping the $\nu = -2/3$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI). We establish a duality between this problem and doping a gapped SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid (CSL).</description>

      <title>The role of electron interactions in a failed insulator revealed by shot noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In materials known as failed insulators, electrical resistivity increases as temperature decreases, yet does not diverge - a phenomenon inconsistent with single-particle theories. We investigate the origin of this behavior by measuring shot noise in nanojunctions of nitrogen-doped beta-Ta, a prototypical failed insulator. Junctions as short as 8 nanometers exhibit hot-electron shot noise, indicating strong electron interactions. We show that charge hopping mediated by these interactions explains the anomalous electronic properties. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting electron interactions in spin-orbitronic and superconducting applications of failed insulators.</description>
