      <description>arXiv:2509.20404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new high-dimensional statistical learning model which can take advantage of structured correlation in data even in the presence of randomness. We completely characterize learnability in this model in terms of VCN${}_{k,k}$-dimension (essentially $k$-dependence from Shelah's classification theory). This model suggests a theoretical explanation for the success of certain algorithms in the 2006~Netflix Prize competition.</description>

      <title>Fast Estimation of Wasserstein Distances via Regression on Sliced Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for multiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we propose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW distances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide upper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure parsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a closed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half as many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small number of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the Wasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of SW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach on diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and Wasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets such as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our method consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance than the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole, particularly in low-data regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimator can also accelerate Wormhole training, yielding \textit{RG-Wormhole}.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with an Unobservable Source Subpopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain. For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this unobservable source subpopulation.</description>

      <title>A Gapped Scale-Sensitive Dimension and Lower Bounds for Offset Rademacher Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gapped scale-sensitive dimensions of a function class in both sequential and non-sequential settings. We demonstrate that covering numbers for any uniformly bounded class are controlled above by these gapped dimensions, generalizing the results of \cite{anthony2000function,alon1997scale}. Moreover, we show that the gapped dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of convergence in statistical and online learning.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Variational Graph Fused Lasso for Recovering Relative Rates in Spatial Compositional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS, and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.</description>

      <title>RAPTOR-GEN: RApid PosTeriOR GENerator for Bayesian Learning in Biomanufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i) an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of biomanufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Conditionally Whitened Generative Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance. Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow). Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance, capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Empirical PAC-Bayes bounds for Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations. Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time, spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite. Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.</description>

      <title>Best-of-$\infty$ -- Asymptotic Performance of Test-Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$, which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs, showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>WISER: Segmenting watermarked region - an epidemic change-point perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text. Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a modern and pertinent problem.</description>

      <title>Breaking the curse of dimensionality for linear rules: optimal predictors over the ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear observations $Y_i = X_i^{\top}\theta + \epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X) Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules -- encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators, including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the Bayes predictor $\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Response to Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note responds to "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning" (Ober et al., 2021). The marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process can be compartmentalized into a data fit term and a complexity penalty. Ober et al. (2021) shows that if a kernel can be multiplied by a signal variance coefficient, then reparametrizing and substituting in the maximized value of this parameter sets a reparametrized data fit term to a fixed value. They use this finding to argue that the complexity penalty, a log determinant of the kernel matrix, then dominates in determining the other values of kernel hyperparameters, which can lead to data overcorrelation. By contrast, we show that the reparametrization in fact introduces another data-fit term which influences all other kernel hyperparameters. Thus, a balance between data fit and complexity still plays a significant role in determining kernel hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity of Variational Bayesian Neural Network Performance to Hyperparameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.</description>

      <title>Incorporating External Controls for Estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated with High-Dimensional Data: Retaining Double Robustness and Ensuring Double Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for causal inference in biomedical research. For instance, when estimating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), a doubly robust estimation procedure can be applied, requiring either the propensity score model or the control outcome model to be correctly specified. In this paper, we address scenarios where external control data, often with a much larger sample size, are available. Such data are typically easier to obtain from historical records or third-party sources. However, we find that incorporating external controls into the standard doubly robust estimator for ATT may paradoxically result in reduced efficiency compared to using the estimator without external controls. This counterintuitive outcome suggests that the naive incorporation of external controls could be detrimental to estimation efficiency. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel doubly robust estimator that guarantees higher efficiency than the standard approach without external controls, even under model misspecification. When all models are correctly specified, this estimator aligns with the standard doubly robust estimator that incorporates external controls and achieves semiparametric efficiency. The asymptotic theory developed in this work applies to high-dimensional confounder settings, which are increasingly common with the growing prevalence of electronic health record data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through extensive simulation studies and a real-world data application.</description>

      <title>Bispectral OT: Dataset Comparison using Symmetry-Aware Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning, graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class or content.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations.</description>

      <title>Learning Ising Models under Hard Constraints using One Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S \subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto \exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$ that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for $k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without [Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA '24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC '19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the truncated Ising model.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm, finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.</description>

      <title>Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p} \rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.</description>

      <title>No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions, portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set, rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance. Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks. Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact, less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need for strong generalization in this setting.</description>

      <title>Towards Complete Causal Explanation with Expert Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of restricting a Markov equivalence class of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) to only those MAGs that contain certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert or orientation knowledge. Such a restriction of the Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a restricted essential ancestral graph. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present several new sound graphical orientation rules for adding orientation knowledge to an essential ancestral graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008b) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with orientation knowledge. Third, we provide an algorithm for including this orientation knowledge and show that in certain settings the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. Finally, outside of the specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995) to settings which allow for latent confounding.</description>

Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</description>

      <title>Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks (TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization algorithm is developed for efficient model inference. Numerical simulations and case studies demonstrate the efficacy of TSSDMN for understanding dynamic multilayer networks.</description>

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms between Banach spaces of functions. They have become an increasingly critical tool for spatiotemporal forecasting and physics emulation, especially in high-stakes scenarios where robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification is required. We introduce Local Sliced Conformal Inference (LSCI), a distribution-free framework for generating function-valued, locally adaptive prediction sets for operator models. We prove finite-sample validity and derive a data-dependent upper bound on the coverage gap under local exchangeability. On synthetic Gaussian-process tasks and real applications (air quality monitoring, energy demand forecasting, and weather prediction), LSCI yields tighter sets with stronger adaptivity compared to conformal baselines. We also empirically demonstrate robustness against biased predictions and certain out-of-distribution noise regimes.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Distribution Compression: Reducing Both Data Size and Dimensionality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.</description>

      <title>Learning to Bid Optimally and Efficiently in Adversarial First-price Auctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.04568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-price auctions have very recently swept the online advertising industry, replacing second-price auctions as the predominant auction mechanism on many platforms. This shift has brought forth important challenges for a bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in second-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value truthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private valuations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first minimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding strategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a good expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that exists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally, through an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price auction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Contextual Combinatorial Bandits with Changing Action Sets via Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a contextual bandit problem with a combinatorial action set and time-varying base arm availability. At the beginning of each round, the agent observes the set of available base arms and their contexts and then selects an action that is a feasible subset of the set of available base arms to maximize its cumulative reward in the long run. We assume that the mean outcomes of base arms are samples from a Gaussian Process (GP) indexed by the context set ${\cal X}$, and the expected reward is Lipschitz continuous in expected base arm outcomes. For this setup, we propose an algorithm called Optimistic Combinatorial Learning and Optimization with Kernel Upper Confidence Bounds (O'CLOK-UCB) and prove that it incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\lambda^*(K)KT\gamma_{KT}(\cup_{t\leq T}\mathcal{X}_t)} )$ regret with high probability, where $\gamma_{KT}(\cup_{t\leq T}\mathcal{X}_t)$ is the maximum information gain associated with the sets of base arm contexts $\mathcal{X}_t$ that appeared in the first $T$ rounds, $K$ is the maximum cardinality of any feasible action over all rounds, and $\lambda^*(K)$ is the maximum eigenvalue of all covariance matrices of selected actions up to time $T$, which is a function of $K$. To dramatically speed up the algorithm, we also propose a variant of O'CLOK-UCB that uses sparse GPs. Finally, we experimentally show that both algorithms exploit inter-base arm outcome correlation and vastly outperform the previous state-of-the-art UCB-based algorithms in realistic setups.</description>

      <title>Rosenthal-type inequalities for linear statistics of Markov chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish novel concentration inequalities for additive functionals of geometrically ergodic Markov chains similar to Rosenthal inequalities for sums of independent random variables. We pay special attention to the dependence of our bounds on the mixing time of the corresponding chain. Precisely, we establish explicit bounds that are linked to the constants from the martingale version of the Rosenthal inequality, as well as the constants that characterize the mixing properties of the underlying Markov kernel. Finally, our proof technique is, up to our knowledge, new and is based on a recurrent application of the Poisson decomposition.</description>

      <title>Energy based diffusion generator for efficient sampling of Boltzmann distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Boltzmann distributions, particularly those tied to high dimensional and complex energy functions, poses a significant challenge in many fields. In this work, we present the Energy-Based Diffusion Generator (EDG), a novel approach that integrates ideas from variational autoencoders and diffusion models. EDG uses a decoder to generate Boltzmann-distributed samples from simple latent variables, and a diffusion-based encoder to estimate the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution. Notably, EDG is simulation-free, eliminating the need to solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations during training. Furthermore, by removing constraints such as bijectivity in the decoder, EDG allows for flexible network design. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of EDG across a variety of sampling tasks with complex target distributions, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Cocycles: A Framework for Robust and Coherent Counterfactual Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating joint distributions (a.k.a. couplings) over counterfactual outcomes is central to personalized decision-making and treatment risk assessment. Two emergent frameworks with identifiability guarantees are: (i) bijective structural causal models (SCMs), which are flexible but brittle to mis-specified latent noise; and (ii) optimal-transport (OT) methods, which avoid latent noise assumptions but can produce incoherent counterfactual transports which fail to identify higher-order couplings. In this work, we bridge the gap with \emph{counterfactual cocycles}: a framework for counterfactual transports that use algebraic structure to provide coherence and identifiability guarantees. Every counterfactual cocycle corresponds to an equivalence class of SCMs, however the cocycle is invariant to the latent noise distribution, enabling us to sidestep various mis-specification problems. We characterize the structure of all identifiable counterfactual cocycles; propose flexible model parameterizations; introduce a novel cocycle estimator that avoids any distributional assumptions; and derive mis-specification robustness properties of the resulting counterfactual inference method. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and noise-robustness of counterfactual cocycles across synthetic benchmarks and a 401(k) eligibility study.</description>

      <title>Understanding Optimization in Deep Learning with Central Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional theories of optimization cannot describe the dynamics of optimization in deep learning, even in the simple setting of deterministic training. The challenge is that optimizers typically operate in a complex, oscillatory regime called the "edge of stability." In this paper, we develop theory that can describe the dynamics of optimization in this regime. Our key insight is that while the *exact* trajectory of an oscillatory optimizer may be challenging to analyze, the *time-averaged* (i.e. smoothed) trajectory is often much more tractable. To analyze an optimizer, we derive a differential equation called a "central flow" that characterizes this time-averaged trajectory. We empirically show that these central flows can predict long-term optimization trajectories for generic neural networks with a high degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these central flows, we are able to understand how gradient descent makes progress even as the loss sometimes goes up; how adaptive optimizers "adapt" to the local loss landscape; and how adaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards regions where they can take larger steps. Our results suggest that central flows can be a valuable theoretical tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration using a Monotonic Neural Network Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world black-box optimization problems have multiple conflicting objectives. Rather than attempting to approximate the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions, interactive preference learning allows to focus the search on the most relevant subset. However, few previous studies have exploited the fact that utility functions are usually monotonic. In this paper, we address the Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration (BOPE) problem and propose using a neural network ensemble as a utility surrogate model. This approach naturally integrates monotonicity and supports pairwise comparison data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits robustness to noise in utility evaluations. An ablation study highlights the critical role of monotonicity in enhancing performance.</description>

      <title>Regularization can make diffusion models more efficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Reward Model a Good Teacher? An Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. However, while this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient~optimization.</description>

      <title>Provably Sample-Efficient Robust Reinforcement Learning with Average Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) under the average-reward criterion is essential for long-term decision-making, particularly when the environment may differ from its specification. However, a significant gap exists in understanding the finite-sample complexity of these methods, as most existing work provides only asymptotic guarantees. This limitation hinders their principled understanding and practical deployment, especially in data-limited scenarios. We close this gap by proposing \textbf{Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI)}, a new algorithm designed for robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with transition uncertainty characterized by $\ell_p$-norm and contamination models. Our approach offers three key advantages over previous methods: (1). Weaker Structural Assumptions: RHI only requires the underlying robust MDP to be communicating, a less restrictive condition than the commonly assumed ergodicity or irreducibility; (2). No Prior Knowledge: Our algorithm operates without requiring any prior knowledge of the robust MDP; (3). State-of-the-Art Sample Complexity: To learn an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy, RHI achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}\left(\frac{SA\mathcal H^{2}}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)$, where $S$ and $A$ denote the numbers of states and actions, and $\mathcal H$ is the robust optimal bias span. This result represents the tightest known bound. Our work hence provides essential theoretical understanding of sample efficiency of robust average reward RL.</description>

      <title>Why and When Deep is Better than Shallow: An Implementation-Agnostic State-Transition View of Depth Supremacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why and when is deep better than shallow? We answer this question in a framework that is agnostic to network implementation. We formulate a deep model as an abstract state-transition semigroup acting on a general metric space, and separate the implementation (e.g., ReLU nets, transformers, and chain-of-thought) from the abstract state transition. We prove a bias-variance decomposition in which the variance depends only on the abstract depth-$k$ network and not on the implementation (Theorem 1). We further split the bounds into output and hidden parts to tie the depth dependence of the variance to the metric entropy of the state-transition semigroup (Theorem 2). We then investigate implementation-free conditions under which the variance grow polynomially or logarithmically with depth (Section 4). Combining these with exponential or polynomial bias decay identifies four canonical bias-variance trade-off regimes (EL/EP/PL/PP) and produces explicit optimal depths $k^\ast$. Across regimes, $k^\ast&gt;1$ typically holds, giving a rigorous form of depth supremacy. The lowest generalization error bound is achieved under the EL regime (exp-decay bias + log-growth variance), explaining why and when deep is better, especially for iterative or hierarchical concept classes such as neural ODEs, diffusion/score models, and chain-of-thought reasoning.</description>

      <title>Bridging Arbitrary and Tree Metrics via Differentiable Gromov Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data. Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Time Analysis of TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation without Projections or Strong Convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time convergence properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, a cornerstone algorithm in the field of reinforcement learning.
  We are interested in the so-called ``robust'' setting, where the convergence guarantee does not depend on the minimal curvature of the potential function.
  While prior work has established convergence guarantees in this setting, these results typically rely on the assumption that each iterate is projected onto a bounded set, a condition that is both artificial and does not match the current practice.
  In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such an assumption and present a refined analysis of TD learning. For the first time, we show that the simple projection-free variant converges with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{||\theta^*||^2_2}{\sqrt{T}})$, even in the presence of Markovian noise. Our analysis reveals a novel self-bounding property of the TD updates and exploits it to guarantee bounded iterates.</description>

      <title>Improved Scaling Laws in Linear Regression via Data Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase. However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a &gt; b &gt; 1$), we show that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$, where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting, one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse (i.e., choosing $L&gt;N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are also provided to verify our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.</description>

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases, results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation, which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied five machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. Overall, our findings show that Random Forest with A2 copula oversampling (theta = 10) achieved the best performance, with improvements of 5.3% in accuracy, 9.5% in precision, 5.7% in recall, 7.6% in F1-score, and 1.1% in AUC compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we statistically validated our results using the McNemar's test. This research represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas as a statistical method in machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>An entropy-optimal path to humble AI</title>

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to very successful, but by no means humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability and the exact convex polytope representations. We show that it results in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and cheaply-computable confidence/reliability measures for both the model inputs and the outputs. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a broad set of synthetic and real-world problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of important La Ni\~na and El Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training - a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction tools.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Stein Diffusion Guidance: Posterior Correction for Sampling Beyond High-Density Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training free diffusion guidance provides a flexible way to leverage off-the-shelf classifiers without additional training. Yet, current approaches hinge on posterior approximations via Tweedie's formula, which often yield unreliable guidance, particularly in low-density regions. Stochastic optimal control (SOC), in contrast, provides principled posterior simulation but is prohibitively expensive for fast sampling. In this work, we reconcile the strengths of these paradigms by introducing Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a novel training-free framework grounded in a surrogate SOC objective. We establish a theoretical bound on the value function, demonstrating the necessity of correcting approximate posteriors to faithfully reflect true diffusion dynamics. Leveraging Stein variational inference, SDG identifies the steepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between approximate and true posteriors. By incorporating a principled Stein correction mechanism and a novel running cost functional, SDG enables effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on molecular low-density sampling tasks suggest that SDG consistently surpasses standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential for broader diffusion-based sampling beyond high-density regions.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure Learning in Hawkes Processes with Complex Latent Confounder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time causal model as the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite the presence of latent subprocesses.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Few-Shot Neural Emulator for Computer-Model System Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long-horizon rollout of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories. Finally, with only 10 solver steps' worth of augmented stencil data, our approach outperforms traditional ML emulators trained on thousands of trajectories in long-horizon rollout accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs. Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing accurate, data-efficient surrogate models is central to advancing AI for Science. Neural operators (NOs), which approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using conventional neural architectures, have gained popularity as surrogates for systems driven by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their reliance on large datasets and limited ability to generalize in low-data regimes hinder their practical utility. We argue that these limitations arise from their global processing of data, which fails to exploit the local, discretized structure of physical systems. To address this, we propose Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) as a principled surrogate modeling paradigm for time-dependent PDEs. GNS leverages message-passing combined with numerical time-stepping schemes to learn PDE dynamics by modeling the instantaneous time derivatives. This design mimics traditional numerical solvers, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts and strong inductive biases that enhance generalization. We rigorously evaluate GNS on four canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D scalar Burgers', (2) 2D coupled Burgers', (3) 2D Allen-Cahn, and (4) 2D nonlinear shallow-water equations, comparing against state-of-the-art NOs including Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Results demonstrate that GNS is markedly more data-efficient, achieving less than 1% relative L2 error using only 3% of available trajectories, and exhibits dramatically reduced error accumulation over time (82.5% lower autoregressive error than FNO, 99.9% lower than DeepONet). To choose the training data, we introduce a PCA combined with KMeans trajectory selection strategy. These findings provide compelling evidence that GNS, with its graph-based locality and solver-inspired design, is the most suitable and scalable surrogate modeling framework for AI-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Expressive Power of Deep Networks on Manifolds: Simultaneous Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s&lt;k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Selective Risk Certification for LLM Outputs via Information-Lift Statistics: PAC-Bayes, Robustness, and Skeleton Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models frequently generate confident but incorrect outputs, requiring formal uncertainty quantification with abstention guarantees. We develop information-lift certificates that compare model probabilities to a skeleton baseline, accumulating evidence into sub-gamma PAC-Bayes bounds valid under heavy-tailed distributions. Across eight datasets, our method achieves 77.2\% coverage at 2\% risk, outperforming recent 2023-2024 baselines by 8.6-15.1 percentage points, while blocking 96\% of critical errors in high-stakes scenarios vs 18-31\% for entropy methods. Limitations include skeleton dependence and frequency-only (not severity-aware) risk control, though performance degrades gracefully under corruption.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Field-of-View Enhanced Signal-Dependent Binauralization of Moving Talkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mixture of experts framework for field-of-view enhancement in binaural signal matching. Our approach enables dynamic spatial audio rendering that adapts to continuous talker motion, allowing users to emphasize or suppress sounds from selected directions while preserving natural binaural cues. Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit direction-of-arrival estimation or operate in the Ambisonics domain, our signal-dependent framework combines multiple binaural filters in an online manner using implicit localization. This allows for real-time tracking and enhancement of moving sound sources, supporting applications such as speech focus, noise reduction, and world-locked audio in augmented and virtual reality. The method is agnostic to array geometry offering a flexible solution for spatial audio capture and personalized playback in next-generation consumer audio devices.</description>
