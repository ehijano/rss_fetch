      <title>Optimal Sequential Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new algebraic technique to solve the sequential flow problem in polynomial space. The task is to maximize the flow through a graph where edge capacities can be changed over time by choosing a sequence of capacity labelings from a given finite set. Our method is based on a novel factorization theorem for finite semigroups that, applied to a suitable flow semigroup, allows to derive small witnesses. This generalizes to multiple in/output vertices, as well as regular constraints.</description>

      <title>Model Learning for Adjusting the Level of Automation in HCPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The steadily increasing level of automation in human-centred systems demands rigorous design methods for analysing and controlling interactions between humans and automated components, especially in safety-critical applications. The variability of human behaviour poses particular challenges for formal verification and synthesis. We present a model-based framework that enables design-time exploration of safe shared-control strategies in human-automation systems. The approach combines active automata learning -- to derive coarse, finite-state abstractions of human behaviour from simulations -- with game-theoretic reactive synthesis to determine whether a controller can guarantee safety when interacting with these models. If no such strategy exists, the framework supports iterative refinement of the human model or adjustment of the automation's controllable actions. A driving case study, integrating automata learning with reactive synthesis in UPPAAL, illustrates the applicability of the framework on a simplified driving scenario and its potential for analysing shared-control strategies in human-centred cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>Towards A Catalogue of Requirement Patterns for Space Robotic Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the development of safety and mission-critical systems, including autonomous space robotic missions, complex behaviour is captured during the requirements elicitation phase. Requirements are typically expressed using natural language which is ambiguous and not amenable to formal verification methods that can provide robust guarantees of system behaviour. To support the definition of formal requirements, specification patterns provide reusable, logic-based templates. A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements. We categorised these requirements using pre-existing specification patterns which demonstrated their applicability in space missions. However, not all of the requirements that we formalised corresponded to an existing pattern so we have contributed 5 new requirement specification patterns as well as several variants of the existing and new patterns. We also conducted an expert evaluation of the new patterns, highlighting their benefits and limitations.</description>

      <title>Balanced Fibonacci word rectangles, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational. Finally, we also examine the analogous question for the Tribonacci word and the Thue-Morse word.</description>
