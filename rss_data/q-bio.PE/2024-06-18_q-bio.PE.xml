      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modelling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My methods use ideas from statistical physics and present an alternative to some recently proposed measure-theoretic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Catalytic evolution of cooperation in a population with behavioural bimodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable adaptability of humans in response to complex environments is often demonstrated by the context-dependent adoption of different behavioral modes. However, the existing game-theoretic studies mostly focus on the single-mode assumption, and the impact of this behavioral multimodality on the evolution of cooperation remains largely unknown. Here, we study how cooperation evolves in a population with two behavioral modes. Specifically, we incorporate Q-learning and Tit-for-Tat (TFT) rules into our toy model, where prisoner's dilemma game is played and we investigate the impact of the mode mixture on the evolution of cooperation. While players in Q-learning mode aim to maximize their accumulated payoffs, players within TFT mode repeat what their neighbors have done to them. In a structured mixing implementation where the updating rule is fixed for each individual, we find that the mode mixture greatly promotes the overall cooperation prevalence. The promotion is even more significant in the probabilistic mixing, where players randomly select one of the two rules at each step. Finally, this promotion is robust when players are allowed to adaptively choose the two modes by real-time comparison. In all three scenarios, players within the Q-learning mode act as catalyzer that turns the TFT players to be more cooperative, and as a result drive the whole population to be highly cooperative. The analysis of Q-tables explains the underlying mechanism of cooperation promotion, which captures the ``psychologic evolution" in the players' mind. Our study indicates that the variety of behavioral modes is non-negligible, and could be crucial to clarify the emergence of cooperation in the real world.</description>

      <title>Extinction in agent-based and collective models of bet-hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bet-hedging is a phenotype diversification strategy that combines a fast-growing vulnerable phenotype with a slow-growing resistant phenotype. In environments switching between favorable and unfavorable conditions, bet-hedging optimizes growth and reduces fluctuations over a long time, which is expected to reduce extinction risk. Here, we address directly how bet-hedging can reduce extinction probability in an agent-based model. An agent-based model is appropriate for studying extinction due to the low number of individuals close to extinction. We also show that the agent-based model converges to the collective model behavior for populations of $100$ individuals or more. However, the collective model provides relevant qualitative insight even for low populations. The collective model provides expressions for extinction that stress the relevance of the population number, showing that a factor four increase in the total population has a greater effect than a change of strategy from maximum growth to minimal extinction. This work provides further insight into the impact of finite population effects on the bet-hedging strategy's success.</description>

      <title>The analysis of the impact of fear in the presence of additional food and prey refuge with nonlocal predator-prey models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a predator-prey interaction, many factors are present that affect the growth of the species, either positively or negatively. Fear of predation is such a factor that causes psychological stress in a prey species, so their overall growth starts to decline. In this work, a predator-prey model is proposed where the prey species faces a reduction in their growth out of fear, and the predator is also provided with an alternative food source that helps the prey to hide in a safer place. The dynamics produce a wide range of interesting results, including the significance of the presence of a certain amount of fear or even prey refuge for population coexistence. The analysis is extended later to the nonlocal model to analyze how the non-equilibrium phenomena influence the dynamical behaviour. It is observed through numerical simulations that the scope of pattern formation reduces with the increase of fear level in the spatio-temporal model, whereas the incorporation of nonlocal interaction further increases the chance of species colonization.</description>

      <title>Effects of phylogeny on coexistence in model communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Species' interactions are shaped by their traits. Thus, we expect traits -- in particular, trait (dis)similarity -- to play a central role in determining whether a particular set of species coexists. Traits are, in turn, the outcome of an eco-evolutionary process summarized by a phylogenetic tree. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree associated with a set of species should carry information about the dynamics and assembly properties of the community. Many studies have highlighted the potentially complex ways in which this phylogenetic information is translated into species' ecological properties. However, much less emphasis has been placed on developing clear, quantitative expectations for community properties under a particular hypothesis. To address this gap, we couple a simple model of trait evolution on a phylogenetic tree with Lotka-Volterra community dynamics. This allows us to derive properties of a community of coexisting species as a function of the number of traits, tree topology and the size of the species pool. Our analysis highlights how phylogenies, through traits, affect the coexistence of a set of species. Together, these results provide much-needed baseline expectations for the ways in which evolutionary history, summarized by phylogeny, is reflected in the size and structure of ecological communities.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic spreading of predator-prey populations in a shifting environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent studies associating shifting temperature conditions with changes in the efficiency of predator species in converting their prey to offspring, we propose a predator-prey model of reaction-diffusion type to analyze the consequence of such effects on the population dynamics and spread of species. In the model, the predator conversion efficiency is represented by a spatially heterogeneous function depending on the variable $\xi=x-c_1t$ for some given $c_1&gt;0$. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach, we provide explicit formulas for the spreading speed of the predator species. When the conversion function is monotone increasing, the spreading speed is determined in all cases and non-local pulling is possible. When the function is monotone decreasing, we provide formulas for the spreading speed when the rate of shift of the conversion function is sufficiently fast or slow.</description>

      <title>Parasite infection in a cell population: role of the partitioning kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a cell population subject to a parasite infection. Cells divide at a constant rate and, at division, share the parasites they contain between their two daughter cells. The sharing may be asymmetrical, and its law may depend on the quantity of parasites in the mother. Cells die at a rate which may depend on the quantity of parasites they carry, and are also killed when this quantity explodes. We study the survival of the cell population as well as the mean quantity of parasites in the cells, and focus on the role of the parasites partitioning kernel at division.</description>

      <title>PhyloLM : Inferring the Phylogeny of Large Language Models and Predicting their Performances in Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metrics based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</description>

      <title>An iterated learning model of language change that mixes supervised and unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The iterated learning model is an agent-based model of language change in which language is transmitted from a tutor to a pupil which itself becomes a tutor to a new pupil, and so on. Languages that are stable, expressive, and compositional arise spontaneously as a consequence of a language transmission bottleneck. Previous models have implemented an agent's mapping from signals to meanings using an artificial neural network decoder, but have relied on an unrealistic and computationally expensive process of obversion to implement the associated encoder, mapping from meanings to signals. Here, a new model is presented in which both decoder and encoder are neural networks, trained separately through supervised learning, and trained together through unsupervised learning in the form of an autoencoder. This avoids the substantial computational burden entailed in obversion and introduces a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning as observed during human development.</description>
