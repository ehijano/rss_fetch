      <title>Reconstruction of Bremsstrahlung {\gamma}-rays Spectrum in Heavy Ion Reactions with Richardson-Lucy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high momentum tail (HMT) in the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi surface has been regarded as an evidence of short-range correlations (SRCs) in atomic nuclei. It has been showcased recently that the np Bremsstrahlung radiation in heavy ion reactions can be used to extract HMT information. The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm is introduced to the reconstruction of the original Bremsstrahlung {\gamma}-ray energy spectrum from experimental measurements. By solving the inverse problem of the detector response to the {\gamma}-rays, the original energy spectrum of the Bremsstrahlung {\gamma} in 25 MeV/u 86Kr + 124Sn has been reconstructed and compared to the isospin- and momentum-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) simulations. The analysis based on hypothesis test suggests the existence of the HMT of nucleons in nuclei, in accordance with the previous conclusions. With its effectiveness being demonstrated, it is feasible to apply the RL algorithm in future experiments of measuring the Bremsstrahlung {\gamma}-rays in heavy ion reactions.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter and finite nuclei: recent studies based on Parity Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we summarize recent studies on nuclear matter and finite nuclei based on parity doublet models. We first construct a parity doublet model (PDM), which includes the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ of nucleons together with the mass generated by the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. We then study the density dependence of the symmetry energy in the PDM, which shows that the symmetry energy is larger for smaller chiral invariant mass. Then, we investigate some finite nuclei by applying the Relativistic Continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory to the PDM. We present the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the binding energies and charge radii, and show that $m_0$ = 700 MeV is preferred by the nuclear properties. Finally, we modify the PDM by adding the iso-vector scalar meson $a_0(980)$ and show that the inclusion of the $a_0(980)$ enlarges the symmetry energy of the infinite nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>An IR Fixed Point in QCD with a Dilaton in Nuclear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible consequence of an IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f=2, 3$ in nuclear matter is discussed. It is shown in terms of d(ilaton)-$\chi$ effective field theory (d$\chi$EFT) incorporated in a generalized effective field theory (G$n$EFT) implemented with hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry that the recently measured superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn indicates a surprisingly large anomaly-induced quenching (AIQ) of $g_A$ from the free-space value of 1.276 to $\approx 0.8 $. Combined with the quenching expected from strong nuclear correlations, the effective coupling in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}$ would come to $\sim 0.6$. If this result were reconfirmed, it would impact not only nuclear structure and dense compact-star matter -- where $g_A$ figures in $\pi$-N coupling via the Goldberger-Treiman relation -- but also in search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), e.g. $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, where 4th power of $g_A$ figures.</description>

      <title>Shell structure and shape transition in odd-$Z$ superheavy nuclei with proton numbers $Z=117, 119$: insights from deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study on the structural properties of odd-$Z$ superheavy nuclei with proton numbers $Z=117, 119$, and neutron numbers $N$ increasing from $N=170$ to the neutron dripline within the framework of axially deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc). The results are compared with those of even-even superheavy nuclei with proton numbers $Z=118$ and $120$. We analyze various bulk properties of their ground states, including binding energies, quadrupole deformations, root-mean-square radii, nucleon separation energies, and $\alpha$-decay energies. The coexistence of competing prolate and oblate or spherical shapes leads to abrupt changes in both quadrupole deformations and charge radii as functions of neutron numbers. Compared to even-even nuclei, the odd-mass ones exhibit a more complicated transition picture, in which the quantum numbers of $K^\pi$ of the lowest-energy configuration may change with deformation. This may result in the change of angular momentum in the ground-state to ground-state $\alpha$-decay and thus quench the decay rate in odd-mass nuclei. Moreover, our results demonstrate a pronounced proton shell gap at $Z=120$, instead of $Z=114$, which is consistent with the predictions of most covariant density functional theories. Moreover, large neutron shell gaps are found at $N=172$ and $N=258$ in the four isotopic chains, as well as at $N=184$ in the light two isotopic chains with $Z=117$ and $Z=118$, attributed to the nearly-degenerate $3d$ and $4p$ spin-orbit doublet states due to the presence of bubble structure.</description>

      <title>The 25th anniversary for nuclear chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brief history for the prediction of the nuclear chirality is provided. The theoretical and experimental investigations of the nuclear chirality are reviewed, including the verification of chiral doublet bands, the chiral conundrum and its resolution, and the prediction and observation of the multiple chiral doublets (M$\chi$D). Some recent theoretical progresses are highlighted, including the chiral collective Hamiltonian, the A-plot and the K-plot, the nuclear chirality-parity (ChP) violation, the chiral rotation induced by the pairing correlations, as well as the chiral dynamics. The possibly emerging area, challenges that lie ahead, and opportunities for progress in the context of the nuclear chirality are discussed.</description>

      <title>A study of the nuclear structure of light nuclei at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substructure of atomic nuclei resulting from the clustering of nucleons is crucial for understanding nuclear structure and dynamics. Various cluster configurations can emerge depending on excitation energy, the number and types of core clusters, and the presence of excess neutrons. Despite the prevalence of tightly bound cluster formations in low-lying states, understanding the correlation between clusters and their formation mechanisms remains incomplete. This exploring study investigates nuclear clustering at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) using simulations based on the modified BeAGLE model. By simulating collisions involving $e$+$^{9}$Be, $e$+$^{12}$C, and $e$+$^{16}$O nuclei, we find that the average energy of particles $\langle E \rangle$ and the system size ratios of particles at forward rapidity exhibit sensitivity to alpha clustering and its various configurations. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of nuclear clustering and its implications for future studies at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the direct $^{16}{\rm O}(p, \gamma)^{17}{\rm F}$ astrophysical capture reaction within a potential model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential model is applied for the comparative analysis of the astrophysical direct nuclear capture process $^{16}$O(p,$\gamma)^{17}$F. The phase-equivalent potentials of the Woods-Saxon form for the p$-^{16}$O interaction are examined which reproduce the binding energies and the empirical values of ANC from different sources for the $^{17}$F(5/2$^+$) ground and $^{17}$F(1/2$^+$) ($E^*$=0.495 MeV) excited bound states. The best description of the experimental data for the astrophysical $S$ factor is obtained within the potential model which yields the ANC values of 1.043 fm$^{-1/2}$ and 75.484 fm$^{-1/2}$ for the $^{17}$F($5/2^{+}$) ground and $^{17}$F($1/2^{+}$) excited bound states, respectively. The zero-energy astrophysical factor $S(0)=9.321$ keV b was obtained by using the asymptotic expansion method of D. Baye. The calculated reaction rates are in good agreement with the R-matrix approach and the Bayesian model in the description of the both absolute values and temperature dependence within the region up to 10$^{10}$ K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate one-photon annihilation of the electron-positron pair in the field of a central, very heavy and positively charged atomic nucleus. The explicit formula for the annihilation rate of this process $\Gamma^{(b)}_{1 \gamma}$ is derived. Our formula for this rate can directly be used to describe the actual one-photon annihilation in the ground (bound) states of all positronium hydrides HPs, quasi-stable triplet states of the positron-helium atoms $e^{+}[$ He($2^{3}S_e$)] ions and other systems.</description>

      <title>New Procedure for Evaluation of U(3) Coupling and Recoupling Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple method to calculate Wigner coupling coefficients and Racah recoupling coefficients for U(3) in two group-subgroup chains is presented. While the canonical U(3)-&gt;U(2)-&gt;U(1) coupling and recoupling coefficients are applicable to any system that respects U(3) symmetry, the U(3)-&gt;SO(3) coupling coefficients are more specific to nuclear structure studies. This new procedure precludes the use of binomial coefficients and alternating sums which were used in the 1973 formulation of Draayer and Akiyama, and hence provides faster and more accurate output of requested results. The resolution of the outer multiplicity is based on the null space concept of the U(3) generators proposed by Arne Alex et al., whereas the inner multiplicity in the angular momentum subgroup chain is obtained from the dimension of the null space of the SO(3) raising operator. A C++ library built on this new methodology will be published in a complementary journal that specializes in the management and distribution of such programs.</description>

      <title>Hadronic energy-momentum tensor revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Everything gravitates and they do so through the energy-momentum tensor (EMT). However, there is no consensus on how to define the EMT of a hadron, e.g. the proton, the fundamental building blocks of the visible world. In this work, we show that the hadronic EMT can be cast into the form of relativistic continua with spin. The fluid-like form allows a clear identification of the proper hadronic energy density, pressure and shear. A spin tensor contribution is also identified without the reference to the total angular momentum operator, in alignment with the recent development in relativistic spin hydrodynamics. The hadronic EMT is related to the quantum expectation value of the EMT operator through the convolution with the hadronic wavepacket. To factorize out the hadronic EMT, different multipole expansion schemes are explored. We show that the popular Breit-frame densities and light-front densities emerge as the monopole momentum densities from different factorization schemes.</description>

      <title>Energy momentum tensor on and off the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$ and $\bar c_i$ of a scalar theory using both the light-cone and covariant perturbation theory at the one-loop level. The light-cone formalism provides a potential approach to access these form factors beyond the perturbative regime. However, unlike the covariant formulation, the Poincar\'e symmetry on the light cone is not manifest. In this work, we use perturbation theory as a benchmark to extract the gravitational form factors from the light-front energy-momentum tensor. By comparing results on and off the light cone, we identify $T^{++}, T^{+a}, T^{+-}, T^{12}$ as the "good currents" that are properly renormalized and can be used to extract the gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Dissociation and Transition of Heavy Quarkonia in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the dissociation of heavy quarkonia by thermal partons at the next-to-leading order (NLO, also known as inelastic parton scattering dissociation) in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Utilizing the chromo-electric dipole coupling from QCD multipole expansion as an effective Hamiltonian, this has been conducted in the approach of second-order quantum mechanical perturbation theory, which allows us to systematically incorporate the bound state wave functions. Employing the quarkonium wave functions and binding energies obtained from an in-medium potential model, we then numerically evaluate the dissociation cross sections and rates for various charmonia and bottomonia, where the infrared and collinear divergences are regularized by the thermal masses of medium partons. We demonstrate that distinct from the leading order (LO, also known as gluo-dissociation) counterparts peaking at relatively low gluon energy and falling off thereafter, the NLO cross sections first grow and then nearly saturate as the incident parton energy increases, as a result of the outgoing parton carrying away the excess energy. The resulting NLO dissociation rates increase with temperature and take over from the LO counterparts toward high temperatures, similar to pertinent findings from previous studies. We also evaluate the in-medium second-order transition between different bound states, which may contribute to the total thermal decay widths of heavy quarkonia in the QGP.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of hidden-charm strange pentaquarks, we conduct a systematic study of the magnetic moments of the hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks in molecular picture. We calculate magnetic moments of hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks with strangeness-1 and 2. Magnetic moment gives valuable information about the inner structure and shape of the hadron. The obtained results may be helpful to determine the inner structure of these new yet hypothetical states.</description>

      <title>A Potential Model Study of the Nucleon's Charge and Mass Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the charge and mass distributions within a nucleon and compute the associated squared radii based on a potential model approach. Different constituent quark configurations such as $\Delta$, $Y$, and quark-diquark are considered and compared, with model parameters calibrated by experimental measurements of the proton and neutron charge radius. The results suggest that while the charge radius is dictated by quark dynamics, the mass radius is strongly influenced by nonperturbative QCD contributions to a nucleon's mass that are not sensitive to the constituent quarks. As a result, the mass radius could become substantially different from the charge radius. The obtained nucleon mass distributions of different configurations are further used for simulations of the initial conditions in heavy ion collisions. The computed eccentricities $\varepsilon_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ are found to demonstrate a considerable sensitivity to the input nucleon profiles, especially to the mass radius in the peripheral region as well as for systems with fewer participants.</description>

      <title>Kaon superfluidity in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, it was found that pion superfluidity could be realized in the QCD epoch of the early universe, when lepton flavor asymmetry $|l_{\rm e}+l_\mu|$ is large enough to generate a charge chemical potential $|\mu_{\rm Q}|$ larger than vacuum pion mass. By following the same logic, kaon superfluidity might also be possible when $|l_{\rm e}+l_\mu|$ is so large that $|\mu_{\rm Q}|$ becomes larger than vacuum kaon mass. Such a possibility is checked by adopting Ginzburg-Landau approximation within the three-flavor Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Consider the case with full chemical balance, though kaon superfluidity could be stable compared to the chiral phases with only $\sigma$ condensations, it would get killed by the more favored homogeneous pion superfluidity. If we introduce mismatch between $s$ and $d$ quarks, kaon superfluidity would require so large $s$ quark density that such a state is impossible in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$, and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryons, we determine for the first time the trajectory of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point $(\mathrm{Tr}[M]=\mathrm{cte})$ accurately. Our result at unphysical pion mass is consistent with the lattice simulation at $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV and the extrapolation to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral lagrangian, agrees perfectly well with previous analyses of experimental data. Contrary to other works, we predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, being consistent with the dominance of the LO interaction. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO, we obtain that the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1595\pm8$ MeV, being a singlet representation, while the higher pole belongs to the octet with a mass $E^{(8)}=1600\pm4$ MeV. This can be tested in the future LQCD simulations.</description>

      <title>The coupled-channel analysis of $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ systems within complex scaling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In present work, we perform a coupled-channel analysis of $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ systems with the one-boson-exchange potentials. We first study the $I(J^{PC})=1(1^{+-})$ $B\bar{B}^{*}/B^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$ system to describe the $Z_{b}(10610)$ and $Z_{b}(10650)$ particles as molecular states and determine the reasonable range of cutoff parameter $\Lambda$. Then, other $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ combinations with different quantum numbers are systematically investigated. Some bound states and resonances appear in the isoscalar systems, while only several shallow bound states exist for isovector systems. Far away from the excited conventional $P-$wave bottomium, these predicted states can be easily identified as exotic particles both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, the $\eta_b(nS)/\Upsilon(nS)$ plus light mesons are the excellent final states to search for the bound states, while the $B\bar B^*+h.c.$ and $B^* \bar B^*$ channels are suitable for the resonances. We highly recommend that the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations can hunt for these bottomonium-like states in future.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $^{14}$C spectrum with Silicon Drift Detectors: towards the study of forbidden $\beta$ transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ASPECT-BET (An sdd-SPECTrometer for BETa decay studies) project aims to develop a novel technique for the precise measurement of forbidden $\beta$ spectra in the 10 keV - 1 MeV range. This technique uses a Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) as the main spectrometer, surrounded, if necessary, by a veto system to reject events with only partial energy deposition in the SDD. Accurate knowledge of the spectrometer's response to electrons is essential to reconstruct the theoretical shape of the $\beta$ spectrum. To compute this response, GEANT4 simulations optimized for low-energy electron interactions are used. In this article, we present the performance of these simulations in reconstructing the electron spectra, measured with SDDs, of a $^{109}$Cd monochromatic source, both in vacuum and in air. The allowed $\beta$ spectrum of a $^{14}$C source is also measured and analyzed, and it is shown that the experimental shape factor commonly used in the literature to reconstruct the measured spectrum is not necessary to explain the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Tritium $\beta$-decay and Proton-Proton Fusion in Pionless Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gamow-Teller and Fermi matrix elements, ${\left&lt;\mathbf{GT}\right&gt;}$ and ${\left&lt;\mathbf{F}\right&gt;}$, respectively, for tritium $\beta$-decay are calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) in pionless effective field theory in the absence of Coulomb and isospin violation giving the leading order predictions ${\left&lt;\mathbf{GT}\right&gt;}_{0}=0.9807$ and ${\left&lt;\mathbf{F}\right&gt;}_{0}=1$. Using an experimentally determined value for the tritium-$\beta$ decay GT matrix element, the two-body axial current low energy constant is fixed at NLO yielding $L_{1,A}=6.01\pm2.08$ fm$^{3}$ at the renormalization scale of the physical pion mass, which agrees with predictions based on naive dimensional analysis. Finally, the consequences of Wigner-SU(4) spin-isospin symmetry are considered for the Gamow-Teller matrix element.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the radiogenic neutron production rate through the (${\alpha}$, n) reaction is essential in many fields of physics like dark matter searches, neutrino studies, nuclear astrophysics and medical physics. This white paper provides a review of the current landscape of (${\alpha}$, n) yields, neutron spectra and correlated ${\gamma}$-rays calculations, and describes the existing tools and the available cross-sections. The uncertainties that contribute to (${\alpha}$, n) yield calculations are also discussed with plans for a program to improve the accuracy of these estimates. Novel ideas to measure (${\alpha}$, n) cross-sections for a variety of materials of interest are presented. The goal of this study is to reduce the uncertainty in the expected sensitivity of next-generation physics experiments in the keV--MeV regime.</description>

      <title>Isospin Equilibration in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the isospin equilibration properties of neutrinoless nuclear ($npe$) matter in the temperature and density range that is relevant to neutron star mergers. Our analysis incorporates neutrino-transparency corrections to the isospin (``beta'') equilibrium condition which become noticeable at $T\gtrsim 1\,$MeV. We find that the isospin relaxation rate rises rapidly as temperature rises, and at $T\approx 5\,$MeV it is comparable to the timescale of the density oscillations that occur immediately after the merger. This produces a resonant peak in the bulk viscosity at $T\approx 5\,$MeV, which causes density oscillations to be damped on the timescale of the merger. Our calculations suggest that isospin relaxation dynamics may also be relevant when neutrinos are treated more accurately via neutrino transport schemes.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in a parallel electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we attack the problem of "chiral phase instability" ($\chi$PI) in a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) system under a parallel and constant electromagnetic field. The $\chi$PI refers to that: When $I_2\equiv{\bf E\cdot B}$ is larger than the threshold $I_2^c$, no homogeneous solution can be found for $\sigma$ or $\pi^0$ condensate, and the chiral phase (or angle) $\theta$ becomes unstable. Within the two-flavor chiral perturbation theory, we obtain an effective Lagrangian density for $\theta(x)$ where the chiral anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten term is found to play a role of "source" to the "potential field" $\theta(x)$. The Euler-Lagrangian equation is applied to derive the equation of motion for $\theta(x)$, and physical solutions are worked out for several shapes of system. In the case $I_2&gt;I_2^c$, it is found that the $\chi$PI actually implies an inhomogeneous QCD phase with $\theta(x)$ spatially dependent. By its very nature, the homogeneous-inhomogeneous phase transition is of pure topological and second order at $I_2^c$. Finally, the work is extended to the three-flavor case, where an inhomogeneous $\eta$ condensation is also found to be developed for $I_2&gt;I_2^c$. Correspondingly, there is a second critical point, $I_2^{c'}=24.3I_2^c$, across which the transition is also of topological and second order by its very nature.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we first derive the evolution equation for the general energy-momentum moment of $\delta f$, where $\delta f$ is the deviation from the local equilibrium phase space density. We then introduce a relativistic extension of regularized hydrodynamics developed in the non-relativistic case by Struchtrup and Torrilhon that combines the method of moments and Chapman-Enskog expansion. Hydrodynamic equations up to the third-order in gradients are then systematially derived within the context of a single species system and the relaxation time approximation. This is followed by a series of linear stability and causality analysis. For the system of massless particles without any charge conservation, the third-order hydrodynamics is shown to be linearly stable and causal.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the contribution of color correlations to Double Parton Scattering (DPS). We show that there is a specific class of Feynman diagrams related to so called 1 \textrightarrow{} 2 processes when the contribution of these color correlations is not Sudakov suppressed with the transverse scales. The split scale increases with the transverse scale Q, with color correlations being up to 5-10 percent of singlet ones. The effective absence of Sudakov suppression gives hope that although they are small relative to color singlet correlations, they eventually can be observed.</description>

      <title>Production of $p$-nuclei from $r$-process seeds: the $\nu r$-process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new nucleosynthesis process that may take place on neutron-rich ejecta experiencing an intensive neutrino flux. The nucleosynthesis proceeds similarly to the standard $r$-process, a sequence of neutron-captures and beta-decays, however with charged-current neutrino absorption reactions on nuclei operating much faster than beta-decays. Once neutron capture reactions freeze-out the produced $r$-process neutron-rich nuclei undergo a fast conversion of neutrons into protons and are pushed even beyond the $\beta$-stability line producing the neutron-deficient $p$-nuclei. This scenario, which we denote as the $\nu r$-process, provides an alternative channel for the production of $p$-nuclei and the short-lived nucleus $^{92}$Nb. We discuss the necessary conditions posed on the astrophysical site for the $\nu r$-process to be realized in nature. While these conditions are not fulfilled by current neutrino-hydrodynamic models of $r$-process sites, future models, including more complex physics and a larger variety of outflow conditions, may achieve the necessary conditions in some regions of the ejecta.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of a critical end point (CEP) on the experimentally accessible baryon number fluctuations of different orders. By now, its potential location has been constrained fairly accurately within first principles functional QCD, together with the location of the chiral crossover line and further thermodynamic observables. This information is incorporated in an advanced QCD-assisted low energy effective theory which is used for the computation of baryon number fluctuations at the chemical freeze-out. This computation also takes care of global baryon number conservation at larger density, where the system changes from grand-canonical to canonical statistics. We observe a prominent peak structure, whose amplitude depends on the location of the CEP, while its position is more sensitive to the location of the freeze-out curve. Our results provide guidance for future low energy heavy-ion experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of a background magnetic field when applied to a nonextensive QCD medium in a $2+1$ flavour Nambu\textemdash Jona-Lasinio model. The effect of a constant as well as an $eB$-dependent coupling is considered. For the constant coupling, the well-known magnetic catalysis effect is observed with reduced strength in both the condensates and the transition temperatures compared to the standard extensive medium. In the case of a field-dependent coupling, we observe a competition between the nonextensive parameter, $q$ and $eB$. With sufficiently high $q$-values, the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis \textemdash\, a well-known trait in effective models featuring $eB$-dependent coupling, appears to be eliminated within the range of magnetic fields examined in our present study.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in accreting systems -- signatures of the QCD phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NS) that are born in binary systems with a main-sequence star companion can experience mass transfer, resulting in the accumulation of material at the surface of the NS. This, in turn, leads to the continuous growth of the NS mass and the associated steepening of the gravitational potential. Supposing the central density surpasses the onset for the phase transition from nuclear, generally hadronic matter to deconfined quark-gluon plasma, which is a quantity currently constrained solely from an upper limit by asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the system may experience a dynamic response due to the appearance of additional degrees of freedom in the equation of state (EOS). This dynamical response might give rise to a rapid softening of the EOS during the transition in the hadron-quark matter co-existence region. While this phenomenon has long been studied in the context of hydrostatic configurations, the dynamical implications of this problem are still incompletely understood. It is the purpose of the present paper to simulate the dynamics of NSs with previously accreted envelopes caused by the presence of a first-order QCD phase transition. Therefore, we employed the neutrino radiation hydrodynamics treatment based on the fully general relativistic approach in spherical symmetry, implementing a three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic model EOS that contains a first-order hadron-quark phase transition. The associated neutrino signal shows a sudden rise in the neutrino fluxes and average energies, becoming observable for the present generation of neutrino detectors for a galactic event, and a gravitational wave mode analysis revealed the behaviors of the dominant $f$ mode and the first and the second gravity $g$ modes that are excited during the NS evolution across the QCD phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of QCD equation of state in external magnetic field and nonzero baryon density. Our study is carried out by means of lattice simulation with 2+1 dynamical staggered quarks at the physical masses. The simulation is conducted at imaginary baryon chemical potential what allowed us to overcome the sign problem. We expand the pressure in the baryon imaginary chemical potential and study three leading nonzero coefficients in this expansion. These coefficients were calculated for the following values of magnetic field: $eB=0.3$, $0.6$, $1.2$ GeV$^2$ with the lattice sizes $8\times32^3$, $10\times40^3$, $12\times48^3$. Using these data we take continuum limit for the coefficients. Our results indicate considerable enhancement of the expansion coefficients by the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles quantum field theoretical methods to investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities of a strongly magnetized hot QED plasma at the leading order in coupling. The analysis utilized the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation obtained recently. In the relativistic regime, both conductivities exhibit an approximate scaling behavior given by $\sigma_{\parallel,\perp} = T \tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$, where $\tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$ are functions of the dimensionless ratio $|eB|/T^2$ (here $T$ denotes the temperature and $B$ the magnetic field). We argue that the mechanisms for the transverse and longitudinal conductivities differ significantly, leading to a strong suppression of the former in comparison to the latter. Additionally, we extend our analysis to a magnetized quark-gluon plasma, although the approximation's validity breaks down in QCD at strong coupling.</description>
