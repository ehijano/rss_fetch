      <title>Bioconvection and Bloom in Porous environment and Its Assisted Technologies: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioconvection, a phenomenon arising from the collective motion of motile microorganisms, plays a crucial role in shaping microbial distributions, fluid dynamics, and bloom formation in aquatic environments. While extensive research has explored bioconvection in open waters, a significant proportion of microbial life exists within porous habitats, including soils, sediments, and subsurface environments, where the interplay between microbial motility and structural heterogeneity remains less understood. This review synthesizes recent advancements in the study of bioconvective dynamics within porous media, emphasizing the impacts of various external parameters on microbial transport, and spatial organization in structured environments. Additionally, we explore the various scenarios where bloom formation interacts with porous ecosystems. We further discuss the implications of microbial interactions with porous substrates for bioremediation, health management, and industrial applications. A dedicated section explores genetic engineering approaches aimed at modulating microbial motility and growth characteristics to enhance bioconvective behaviour and bloom regulation. By integrating experimental, numerical, and theoretical insights, this review highlights key knowledge gaps and outlines future research directions toward a deeper understanding of microbial transport and bioconvection in porous systems, with potential applications in environmental sustainability and biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Banana DNA derivatives as homeotropic alignment layers in optical devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from bananas was extracted and functionalized and used for the first time as a homeotropic alignment layer for liquid crystals (LCs). Our research was aimed at extracting and investigating DNA from bananas via the synthesis and study of DNA complexes with various surfactants to examine the usefulness of such a complex as an alignment layer in electro-optical transducers. We proposed a simple and eco-friendly synthesis of the DNA complexes isolated from bananas with surfactants, so we transformed the DNA isolated from bananas into a functionalized alignment layer. A biopolymer alignment layer like deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a banana complexed with a cationic surfactant is an excellent alternative to a commonly used but toxic polyimide alignment layer. DNA-based materials are promising for photonic applications and biosensors because of their excellent optical and physical properties, biodegradability, and low production cost. The novelty of the research lies in the potential use of these materials as biodegradable biopolymer alignment layers for optical devices instead of conventional polymers, which are usually harmful for the environment.</description>

      <title>Bridging advection and diffusion in the encounter dynamics of sedimenting marine snow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sinking marine snow particles, composed primarily of organic matter, control the global export of photosynthetically fixed carbon from the ocean surface to depth. The fate of sedimenting marine snow particles is in part regulated by their encounters with suspended, micron-sized objects, which leads to mass accretion by the particles and potentially alters their buoyancy, and with bacteria that can colonize the particles and degrade them. Their collision rates are typically calculated using two types of models focusing either on direct (ballistic) interception with a finite interaction range, or advective-diffusive capture with a zero interaction range. Since the range of applicability of the two models is unknown, and many relevant marine encounter scenarios span across both regimes, quantifying such encounters remains challenging, because the two models yield asymptotically different predictions at high P\'{e}clet numbers. Here, we reconcile the two limiting approaches by quantifying the encounters in the general case using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Solving the advection-diffusion equation in Stokes flow around a sphere to model mass transfer to a large sinking particle by small yet finite-sized objects, we determine a new formula for the Sherwood number as a function of two dimensionless parameters: the P\'{e}clet number and the ratio of small to large particle sizes. We find that diffusion can play a significant role in generating encounters even at high Pe. At Pe as high as $10^6$, the direct interception model underestimates the encounter rate by up to two orders of magnitude. This overlooked contribution of diffusion to encounters suggests that important processes affecting the fate of marine snow, such as colonization by bacteria and plankton or accretion of neutrally buoyant gels, may proceed at a rate much faster than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Stability Control of Metastable States as a Unified Mechanism for Flexible Temporal Modulation in Cognitive Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible modulation of temporal dynamics in neural sequences underlies many cognitive processes. For instance, we can adaptively change the speed of motor sequences and speech. While such flexibility is influenced by various factors such as attention and context, the common neural mechanisms responsible for this modulation remain poorly understood. We developed a biologically plausible neural network model that incorporates neurons with multiple timescales and Hebbian learning rules. This model is capable of generating simple sequential patterns as well as performing delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks that require the retention of stimulus identity. Fast neural dynamics establish metastable states, while slow neural dynamics maintain task-relevant information and modulate the stability of these states to enable temporal processing. We systematically analyzed how factors such as neuronal gain, external input strength (contextual cues), and task difficulty influence the temporal properties of neural activity sequences - specifically, dwell time within patterns and transition times between successive patterns. We found that these factors flexibly modulate the stability of metastable states. Our findings provide a unified mechanism for understanding various forms of temporal modulation and suggest a novel computational role for neural timescale diversity in dynamically adapting cognitive performance to changing environmental demands.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotating helices in viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a pair of rigid rotating helices in a viscous fluid, as a model for bacterial flagellar bundle and a prototype of microfluidic pumps. Combining experiments with hydrodynamic modeling, we examine how spacing and phase difference between the two helices affect their torque, flow field and fluid transport capacity at low Reynolds numbers. Hydrodynamic coupling reduces the torque when the helices rotate in phase at constant angular speed, but increases the torque when they rotate out of phase. We identify a critical phase difference, at which the hydrodynamic coupling vanishes despite the close spacing between the helices. A simple model, based on the flow characteristics and positioning of a single helix, is constructed, which quantitatively predicts the torque of the helical pair in both unbounded and confined systems. Lastly, we show the influence of spacing and phase difference on the axial flux and the pump efficiency of the helices. Our findings shed light on the function of bacterial flagella and provide design principles for efficient low-Reynolds-number pumps.</description>

      <title>Bending-compression coupling in extensible slender microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undulatory slender objects have been a central theme in the hydrodynamics of swimming at low Reynolds number, where the slender body is usually assumed to be inextensible, although some microorganisms and artificial microrobots largely deform with compression and extension. Here, we theoretically study the coupling between the bending and compression/extension shape modes, using a geometrical formulation of microswimmer hydrodynamics to deal with the non-commutative effects between translation and rotation. By means of a coarse-grained minimal model and systematic perturbation expansions for small bending and compression/extension, we analytically derive the swimming velocities and report three main findings. First, we revisit the role of anisotropy in the drag ratio of the resistive force theory and generally demonstrate that no motion is possible for uniform compression with isotropic drag. We then find that the bending-compression/extension coupling generates lateral and rotational motion, which enhances the swimmer's manoeuvrability, as well as changes in progressive velocity at a higher order of expansion, while the coupling effects depend on the phase difference between the two modes. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of often-overlooked Lie bracket contributions in computing net locomotion from a deformation gait. Our study sheds light on compression as a forgotten degree of freedom in swimmer locomotion, with important implications for microswimmer hydrodynamics, including understanding of biological locomotion mechanisms and design of microrobots.</description>

      <title>Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</description>

      <title>Optimization hardness constrains ecological transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. In high-dimensional biological networks like ecosystems, long transients arise from the separate timescales of interactions within versus among subcommunities. Here, we use tools from computational complexity theory to frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in an ecosystem produce difficult, ill-conditioned problems, which physically manifest as transient chaos. We find that the recent success of dimensionality reduction methods in describing ecological dynamics arises due to preconditioning, in which fast relaxation decouples from slow solving timescales. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state species diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using scaling relations originally derived for numerical analysis of complex optimization problems. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>A nonlocal equation describing tumor growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer is a very complex phenomenon that involves many different scales and situations. In this paper we consider a free boundary problem describing the evolution of a tumor colony and we derive a new asymptotic model for tumor growth. We focus on the case of a single phase tumor colony taking into account chemotactic effects in an early stage where there is no necrotic inner region. Thus, our model is valid for the case of multilayer avascular tumors with very little access to both nutrients and inhibitors or the case where the amount of nutrients and inhibitors is very similar to the amount consumed by the multilayer tumor cells. Our model takes the form of a single nonlocal and nonlinear partial differential equation. Besides deriving the model, we also prove a well-posedness result.</description>
