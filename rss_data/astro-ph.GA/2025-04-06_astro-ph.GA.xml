      <title>On the presence of a fifth force at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>The DESI Y1 RR Lyrae catalog I: Empirical modeling of the cyclic variation of spectroscopic properties and a chemodynamical analysis of the outer halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the catalog of RR Lyrae stars observed in the first year of operations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. This catalog contains 6,240 RR Lyrae stars out to $\sim100$\,kpc from the Galactic center and over 12,000 individual epochs with homogeneously-derived stellar atmospheric parameters. We introduce a novel methodology to model the cyclical variation of the spectroscopic properties of RR Lyrae from single-epoch measurements. We employ this method to infer the radial velocity and effective temperature variation of fundamental mode and first-overtone RR Lyrae stars and to determine their systemic velocities and mean temperatures. For fundamental mode pulsators, we obtain radial velocity curves with amplitudes of $\sim$30--50\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and effective temperature curves with 300--1,000\,K variations, whereas for first-overtone pulsators these amplitudes are $\sim20$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 600$\,K, respectively. We use our sample to study the metallicity distribution of the halo and its dependence on Galactocentric distance ($R_{\rm GC}$). Using a radius-dependent mixture model, we split the data into chemodynamically distinct components and find that our inner halo sample ($R_{\rm GC}\lesssim50$\,kpc) is predominantly composed of stars with [Fe/H] $\sim-1.5$\,dex and largely radial orbits (with an anisotropy parameter $\beta\sim0.94$), that we associate with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger event. Stars in the outer halo field exhibit a broader and more metal-poor [Fe/H] distribution with more circular orbits ($\beta\sim0.39$). The metallicity gradient of the metal-rich and the metal-poor components is found to be $0.005$ and $0.010$\,dex\,kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. Our catalog highlights DESI's tantalizing potential for studying the Milky Way and the pulsation properties of RR Lyrae stars in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Stellar CoRGI in MaNGA: Stellar Counter-Rotation Galaxies Identified in MaNGA Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counter-rotating (CR) galaxies consist of two coplanar stellar disks rotating in opposite directions -- the main, pre-existing disk with an older stellar population and a younger CR disk likely formed from externally acquired gas. Such systems offer a unique opportunity to study disk assembly by analyzing the stellar populations of each component. Using integral field spectroscopic data from the SDSS-IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we identified a sample of 120 CR disk galaxies by inspecting their kinematic maps and analyzing the shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD), which was recovered non-parametrically. For one-third of our sample, we further derived the ages and metallicities of stars for both disks via a spectral decomposition technique. We show that the observed kinematic bimodality -- where the CR disk is either concentrated in the central region (inner~CR) or dominates the outer part of the galaxy (outer~CR) -- is driven by differences in the stellar mass and angular momentum of the CR disk. The wide range of stellar metallicities observed in CR disks suggests that no single source of external material is solely responsible for CR formation in all galaxies; instead, proposed mechanisms such as merger with gas-rich satellites, accretion from cosmic filaments, and exchange of gas between neighboring galaxies can dominate in individual cases.</description>

      <title>Ain't no resonance high enough: Core collapse in self-interacting dark matter across two decades in halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core collapse, a process associated with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, can increase the central density of halos by orders of magnitude with observable consequences for dwarf galaxy properties and gravitational lensing. Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \ \rm{M_\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \sim 5$-$50 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Describing the Non-Universal Galaxy Merger Timescales in IllustrisTNG: Effects of Host Halo Mass, Baryons, and Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy merger timescales are crucial for understanding and modeling galaxy formation in our hierarchically structured Universe. However, previous studies have reported widely varying dependencies of merger timescales on initial orbital parameters and mass ratio at the first crossing of $r_{\rm vir}$. Using IllustrisTNG simulations, we find that these dependencies vary with host halo mass, suggesting that discrepancies in prior studies may arise from differences in the systems analyzed. Specifically, in low-mass halos, merger timescales show a stronger dependence on initial orbital parameters, while in high-mass halos, this dependence weakens. To account for these variations, we present a fitting formula that incorporates host mass dependence, achieving a logarithmic scatter smaller than 0.15 dex. Comparing dark matter-only and baryonic simulations, we observe similar merger timescales for circular orbits but notable differences for radial orbits. In halos with $M_{\rm{host}} &lt; 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, mergers in dark matter-only runs take longer than in baryonic runs, whereas the trend reverses in more massive halos. We attribute these differences to the competing effects of tidal disruption by central galaxy disks and the resistance of baryonic satellites to tidal stripping. Finally, we extend our model to predict merger timescales from any starting radius within the halo. By fitting the extended model to the entire infall sample, we find that using only the merger sample can underestimate merger timescales, particularly for low mass ratios. Our model provides a valuable tool for improving semi-analytical and empirical models of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>AGN outflows and their properties in Mrk 766 as revealed by KOOLS-IFU on the Seimei Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the emission-line flux distributions and their ratios, as well as the gas outflow features, of the innermost 2 kpc region of the type 1 Seyfert galaxy Mrk 766, using the Kyoto Okayama Optical Low-dispersion Spectrograph with an optical-fiber integral field unit on the Seimei Telescope. We find that the central region of Mrk 766 is kinematically disturbed, exhibiting asymmetric and radially distributed AGN-driven ionized gas outflows traced by \OIII\ with velocities exceeding 500 \kms. The mass of the ionized gas outflow is estimated to be $10^{4.65-5.95} M_{\odot}$, and the mass outflow rate is $0.14-2.73$ M${\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This corresponds to a kinetic power, $\dot{E}_{\rm K}$, of $4.31 \times 10^{40} \ {\rm erg} \ {\rm s^{-1}}&lt; \dot{E}_{\rm K} &lt; 8.62 \times 10^{41} \ {\rm erg} \ {\rm s^{-1}}$, which is equivalent to $0.08\%-1.53\%$ of the bolometric luminosity, $L_{\rm bol}$. This result is consistent with other observed properties of ionized gas outflows, although it is lower than the theoretical predictions in AGN feedback models ($\sim5\%$), implying that ionized gas outflows traced by \OIII\ represent only a minor fraction of the total outflows ejected from the host galaxy. Given the asymmetric and radially distributed outflow signatures observed across the host galaxy within the limited field of view, the maximum distance the outflowing gas has traveled remains an open question.</description>

      <title>The Spheroidal Analogue Method for Modeling Irregular Porous Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the optical properties of an irregular porous grain with effective radius $a_{\rm eff}\lesssim 3\lambda$ (where $\lambda$ is the wavelength) can be well approximated by a ``spheroidal analogue'': a spheroid with appropriate axial ratio and size, with a dielectric function obtained from an effective medium theory. Prescriptions for specifying the axial ratio and porosity of the spheroidal analogue, based on simple geometric properties, are given. The accuracy of the spheroidal analogue method is studied for irregular grains with a range of structures and porosities. Different effective medium theories are compared; Bruggeman's theory is found to give the best results. The accuracy of the spheroidal analogue method justifies the use of spheroids for modeling absorption, scattering and polarization by interstellar, circumstellar, or interplanetary dust.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared Spectroscopy with IGRINS-2 for Studying Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy have opened new opportunities for studying multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs), particularly for newly discovered clusters in the inner Milky Way. While optical spectroscopy has traditionally played a primary role in detailed chemical abundance studies of GCs, the increasing discovery of GCs in highly reddened environments underscores the need for robust NIR spectroscopic methods. To evaluate the utility of high-resolution NIR spectroscopy for studying multiple stellar populations, we observed six stars in M5, a well-studied halo GC, using the recently commissioned IGRINS-2 spectrograph on the Gemini-North telescope. Our chemical abundance measurements in the NIR wavelength range show good agreement with those derived from high-resolution optical spectroscopy, with minor systematic offsets in elements such as Na and Mg. In addition, the measured chemical abundance ratios clearly reproduce the distinctive patterns of multiple stellar populations, including the Na-O anti-correlation. The ability of NIR spectroscopy to measure C, N, and O abundances with high precision further enhances its utility for studying chemical properties of stars and GCs. Our findings demonstrate that IGRINS-2 and similar instruments have significant potential to advance our understanding of GC formation, stellar chemical evolution, and the evolutionary history of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Ultra-diffuse Galaxy NGC5846_UDG1 through the Kinematics of its Rich Globular Cluster System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have shown their globular cluster (GC) systems to be central in unveiling their remarkable properties and halo masses. Deep HST imaging revealed 54 GC candidates around the UDG NGC5846_UDG1 (UDG1), with a remarkable 13 per cent of the stellar light contained in the GC system. We present a kinematic analysis of UDG1's GC system from observations with the integral field spectrograph KCWI on the Keck II telescope. We measure recessional velocities for 19 GCs, confirming them as members of UDG1, giving a total of 20 confirmed GCs when combined with literature. Approximately 9 per cent of the stellar light are contained just in the confirmed GCs. We determine the GC system's velocity dispersion to be $\sigma_{\rm GC}$=29.8$^{+6.4}_{-4.9}$ km s$^{-1}$. We find that $\sigma_{\rm GC}$ increases with increasing magnitude, consistent with predictions for a GC system that evolved under the influence of dynamical friction. The GC system velocity dispersion is constant out to $\sim1R_{\rm eff}$. Using $\sigma_{\rm GC}$, we calculate $M_{\rm dyn}$=$2.09^{+1.00}_{-0.64}\times$10$^{9}$M$_{\odot}$ as the dynamical mass enclosed within $\sim$2.5 kpc. The dark matter halo mass suggested by the GC number-halo mass relationship agrees with our dynamical mass estimate, implying a halo more massive than suggested by common stellar mass-halo mass relationships. UDG1, being GC-rich with a massive halo, fits the picture of a failed galaxy.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive JWST+ALMA Study on the Extended Ly$\alpha$ Emitters, Himiko and CR7 at $z\sim 7$: Blue Major Merger Systems in Stark Contrast to Submillimeter Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present various properties of two bright extended Ly$\alpha$ objects, Himiko and CR7, at $z=6.6$ thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins. Himiko (CR7) shows at least five (four) clumps with small separations of 2.4--7.3 kpc and velocity offsets of $\Delta v&lt;220~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ in the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ line maps, three of which exhibit stellar components with comparable stellar masses ranging in $\log{(M_*/M_\odot)}=8.4$--$9.0$ ($8.3$--$8.8$), indicative of major merger systems that are consistent with our numerical simulations. The [CII]158$\mu$m and Ly$\alpha$ lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250--400$~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad H$\alpha$ ($\sim1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^{6.6}~M_\odot$, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7. We find low metallicities of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=$7.9--8.1 in Himiko and CR7 based on auroral [OIII]$\lambda4363$ and strong lines that are consistent with no 1-mm continuum detection corresponding to the dust mass limits of $M_\mathrm{dust}\lesssim 9\times 10^6 M_\odot$. Himiko and CR7 are metal- and dust-poor blue merger systems with stellar and dust masses $\gtrsim2$ orders of magnitude smaller than the massive dust-rich merger systems represented by submillimeter galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gaia GraL: Gaia gravitational lens systems IX. Using XGBoost to explore the Gaia Focused Product Release GravLens catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Quasar strong gravitational lenses are important tools for putting constraints on the dark matter distribution, dark energy contribution, and the Hubble-Lemaitre parameter. We aim to present a new supervised machine learning-based method to identify these lenses in large astrometric surveys. The Gaia Focused Product Release (FPR) GravLens catalogue is designed for the identification of multiply imaged quasars, as it provides astrometry and photometry of all sources in the field of 4.7 million quasars. Methods. Our new approach for automatically identifying four-image lens configurations in large catalogues is based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting classification algorithm. To train this supervised algorithm, we performed realistic simulations of lenses with four images that account for the statistical distribution of the morphology of the deflecting halos as measured in the EAGLE simulation. We identified the parameters discriminant for the classification and performed two different trainings, namely, with and without distance information. Results. The performances of this method on the simulated data are quite good, with a true positive rate and a true negative rate of about 99.99% and 99.84%, respectively. Our validation of the method on a small set of known quasar lenses demonstrates its efficiency, with 75% of known lenses being correctly identified. We applied our algorithm (both trainings) to more than 0.9 million quadruplets selected from the Gaia FPR GravLens catalogue. We derived a list of 1127 candidates with at least one score larger than 0.75, where each candidate has two scores -- one from the model trained with distance information and one from the model trained without distance information -- and including 201 very good candidates with both high scores.</description>

      <title>The Galactic-Centre Arms inferred from ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing longitude-velocity diagrams (LVDs) in the CS(J=2-1) and H13CN(J=1-0) molecular lines from the internal release data of the ALMA Central-Molecular-Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) and in the 13CO (J=1-0) line from the Nobeyama Galactic-Centre (GC) survey, we identify six GC Arms as prominent straight LV ridges. In addition to the currently known Arms I to IV, we identify a new inner arm, Arm V, and further highlight the circum-nuclear disc (CND) as Arm VI. Integrated intensity maps of the Arms on the sky suggest that most of the Arms compose ring-like structures inclined from the Galactic plane. We determine the radii (curvatures) of the Arms using the velocity-gradient ($dv/dl$) method, assuming that the arms are rotating on circular orbits at a constant velocity of $\sim 150$ km/s. We show that Arms I and II compose the main ring structure of the CMZ with radii $\sim 100$--120 pc; Arm III is a dense arm 42 pc from the GC; Arm IV is a clear and narrow arm 20 pc from the GC; and Arm V is a faint, long arm of 8.2 pc radius. We show that the circum-nuclear disc (CND) composes the sixth arm, Arm VI, of radius $\sim 2.3$ pc associated with bifurcated spiral fins. We also discuss the association of the 20- and 50-km/s clouds with these Arms. The radii of the arms fall on an empirical relation $R\sim 630 (2/5)^N$ for $N=1$ (Arm I) to 6 (VI), suggesting either discrete rings or a logarithmic spiral with pitch angle $\sim 22^\circ$. The vertical full extent of the arm increases with radius and is represented by $z\sim 0.7 (R/1 {\rm pc})^{0.7}$ pc. The tilt angle of the arms from the Galactic plane, or the warping, increases rapidly toward the GC.</description>

      <title>Infrared bubble recognition in the Milky Way and beyond using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deep learning model that can detect Spitzer bubbles accurately using two-wavelength near-infrared data acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope and JWST. The model is based on the Single Shot MultiBox Detector as an object detection model, trained and validated using Spitzer bubbles identified by the Milky Way Project (MWP-Bubble). We found that using only MWP-Bubbles with clear structures, along with normalization and data augmentation, significantly improved performance. To reduce the dataset bias, we also use the data without bubbles in the dataset selected by combining two techniques: negative sampling and clustering. The model was optimized by hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization. Applying this model to a test region of the Galactic plane resulted in a 98 $\%$ detection rate for MWP-Bubbles with 8 $\mu$ m emission clearly encompassing 24 $\mu$ m emission. Additionally, we applied the model to a broader area of $1^\circ \leq |l| \leq 65^\circ$, $|b| \leq 1^\circ$, including both training and validation regions, and the model detected 3,006 bubbles, of which 1,413 were newly detected. We also attempted to detect bubbles in the high-mass star-forming region Cygnus $X$, as well as in the external galaxies Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and NGC 628. The model successfully detected Spitzer bubbles in these external galaxies, though it also detected Mira-type variable stars and other compact sources that can be difficult to distinguish from Spitzer bubbles. The detection process takes only a few hours, demonstrating the efficiency in detecting bubble structures. Furthermore, the method used for detecting Spitzer bubbles was applied to detect shell-like structures observable only in the 8 $\mu$ m emission band, leading to the detection of 469 shell-like structures in the LMC and 143 in NGC 628.</description>

      <title>XXL-HSC: Host properties of X-ray detected AGNs in XXL clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is compelling evidence that AGNs are strongly influenced by their environment. Therefore, studying the AGN population of clusters is essential, as both large-scale structures and AGN play key roles in galaxy evolution, though the interactions between these elements are still not well understood. The primary objective of this study is to unravel the different factors that may significantly affect the triggering of AGN activity in cluster galaxies, including galaxy merging and interactions with other galaxies, and ram pressure from the hot intracluster medium. For our purposes, we used 82 X-ray detected AGN found within a $4r_{500}$ radius of 164 X-ray detected and spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters of the XXL survey, up to a redshift of $z\sim$1. This field is covered by deep optical observations of the Hyper Suprime-Cam, which allows for a reliable morphological classification of galaxies. Furthermore, using the X-ray hardness ratio, the optical spectra and the SEDs of the X-ray sources, we have studied the obscuration and other AGN properties and the SFR of the hosts as further indicators of interactions. We found a moderately significant higher fraction of X-ray AGN in galaxy clusters hosted by merging or disturbed galaxies, compared to non-active cluster galaxies or X-ray AGN in the field. This excess is primarily localised in the cluster outskirts. Also, we discovered a higher number of X-ray-hard AGN (hence, possibly obscured) in clusters than in the field particularly in the outskirts. These findings further support the idea that galaxy mergers and interactions may serve as mechanisms for the triggering and obscuration of AGN activity. The relatively high number of disturbed, merging, and possibly obscured AGN hosts in cluster outskirts suggests that galaxy merging and interactions are key drivers in triggering AGN activity in these outer regions of clusters.</description>

      <title>Intracluster light is a biased tracer of the dark matter distribution in clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters known as intracluster light (ICL) has been proposed as an observable tracer of the cluster's dark matter (DM) halo. Assessing its reliability as a DM tracer requires understanding how the intracluster stars are energetically linked to the underlying DM distribution, which we investigate at $z\approx0$ in 12 galaxy clusters with $M_{178} = 1.18 - 3.71 \times 10^{14}\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ from the Horizon-AGN simulation. We quantify the orbital energies of these components by their mean specific energies ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$, and find that this quantity is $\approx$ 25 per cent lower for the intracluster stars than the DM, whilst the energetics of the satellite galaxies (a standard DM tracer) are only marginally ($\approx$ 5 per cent) higher than the DM. Importantly, the lower ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$ of the intracluster stars compared to the DM is robust against the precise separation between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL. The specific energy distribution of ICL stars is concentrated towards lower energies and poorly samples the higher energies, where much of the DM resides. Consequently, the intracluster stars have velocity distributions with lower typical speeds and a more centrally-concentrated density profile than the DM. We also find that intracluster stars have more radially-biased orbits than the DM, indicating these components have distinct orbital distributions. This study demonstrates that although the morphology of the ICL may match the DM halo, the ICL is a biased tracer of DM, and these biases must be understood in order to infer properties of the DM from the ICL.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred Project: A fast semi-analytic model emulator of hydrodynamical galaxy cluster simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will detect faint galaxies in massive clusters, advancing our understanding of galaxy formation in dense environments. Comparing these observations with theoretical models requires high-resolution cluster simulations. Hydrodynamical simulations resolve galaxy properties in halos, but face challenges simulating low-mass galaxies due to computational limitations. In contrast, dark matter-only (DMO) simulations can provide higher resolution but need models to populate subhalos with galaxies. In this work, we introduce a fast and efficient emulator of hydrodynamical cluster simulations, based on the semi-analytic models (SAMs) SAGE and SAG. The SAMs are calibrated using cluster galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations at intermediate resolution, ensuring consistency in stellar masses and luminosities across redshifts. These SAMs are then applied to DMO simulations from The Three Hundred Project at three resolutions. We show that the SAG model, unlike SAGE, better emulates galaxy properties even at the highest resolution. This improvement is due to the treatment of orphan galaxies, which contribute significantly to the total population. SAG enables the study of dwarf galaxies down to stellar masses of 10^7 solar masses at the highest resolution, an order of magnitude smaller than those in the hydrodynamical simulations, corresponding to approximately four magnitudes fainter. This shows that SAMs can be effectively calibrated to provide fast and accurate predictions of hydrodynamical simulations, offering an efficient alternative to explore galaxy populations in dense environments.</description>

      <title>JADES: comprehensive census of broad-line AGN from Reionization to Cosmic Noon revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depth and coverage of the first years of JWST observations have revealed low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) across a wide redshift range, shedding light on black hole (BH) assembly and feedback. We present our spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGN obtained from JADES survey data and spanning $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 9$. Our sample of AGN probes a BH mass range of $10^{6-9}$~M$_{\odot}$ at bolometric luminosities down to $10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, implying generally sub-Eddington ratios of $&lt;0.5L_{\rm Edd}$. Most of these AGN are hosted in low mass ($M_{\star}\sim10^8$~M$_{\odot}$) galaxies and are overmassive relative to the local $M_{BH}-M_{\star}$ relation, while remaining consistent with the local $M_{BH}$-$\sigma_*$ relation. The wide redshift range provided by our sample allows us to trace the emergence of local $M_{BH}$-$M_*$ scaling relation across the cosmic epoch. Additionally, we explore the capability of narrow-line diagnostics in identifying Type 2 AGN and find that a significant fraction of our AGN would be missed by them due to low metallicity or lack of high energy ionizing photons (potentially due to dust absorption, dense gas blanketing the broad and narrow line regions, or intrinsically soft ionizing spectra). We explore the UV luminosity function of AGN and their hosts and find that it is subject to significant cosmic variance and is also dependent on the AGN bolometric luminosity. Finally, we show that the electron and Balmer scattering scenarios recently proposed to explain the broad components of the Balmer lines are untenable on multiple grounds. There is no evidence that the black hole masses have been overestimated by orders of magnitude as proposed in those scenarios.</description>

      <title>JWSTs PEARLS: NIRCam imaging and NIRISS spectroscopy of a $z=3.6$ star-forming galaxy lensed into a near-Einstein Ring by a $z=1.258$ massive elliptical galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery, and initial lensing analysis, of a high-redshift galaxy-galaxy lensing system within the JWST-PEARLS/HST-TREASUREHUNT North Ecliptic Pole Time Domain Field (designated NEPJ172238.9+655143.1). The lensing geometry shears a $z=3.6\pm0.1$ star-forming galaxy into a near-Einstein ring with a radius of 0\farcs92, consisting of 4 primary images, around a foreground massive elliptical galaxy at $z=1.258\pm0.005$. The system is fortuitously located within the NIRISS F200W footprint of the PEARLS survey, enabling spectroscopic identification of the 8500A TiO band in the foreground galaxy and allowing tight constraints to be placed on the redshift of the background galaxy based on its continuum detection and lack of strong emission lines. We calculate magnification factors of $2.6&lt;\mu&lt;8.4$ for the four images and a total lensing mass of $(4.08 \pm 0.07)\times10^{11}M_\odot$. SED fitting of the foreground elliptical galaxy within the Einstein radius reveals a stellar mass of $\sim1.26\times10^{11}M_\odot$, providing a mass/light ratio of 3.24. Employing simple scaling relations and assumptions, an NFW dark matter halo is found to provide the correct remaining mass within $0.12^{+0.21}_{-0.09}$dex. However, if a bottom-heavy IMF for elliptical galaxies is employed, stellar mass estimations increase and can account for the majority of the lensing mass (up to $\sim$83\%), reducing the need for dark matter. This system further demonstrates the new discovery space that the combined wavelength coverage, sensitivity and resolution of JWST now enables.</description>

      <title>CHILES IX: Observational and Simulated HI Content and Star Formation of Blue Galaxies in Different Cosmic Web Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the redshift evolution of the relationship between the neutral atomic hydrogen ({\HI}) content and star-formation properties of blue galaxies, along with their location in the cosmic web. Using the COSMOS {\HI} Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES) and the IllustrisTNG (TNG100) cosmological simulation, and the {\disperse} algorithm, we identify the filamentary structure in both observations and simulations, measure the distance of galaxies to the nearest filament spine {\dfil}, and calculate the mean {\HI} gas fraction and the relative specific star formation rate (sSFR) of blue galaxies in three different cosmic web environments -- $0&lt;{\dfil}/\mathrm{Mpc}&lt;2$ (filament cores), $2&lt;{\dfil}/\mathrm{Mpc}&lt;4$ (filament outskirts), and $4&lt;{\dfil}/\mathrm{Mpc}&lt;20$ (voids). We find that, although there are some similarities between CHILES and TNG, there exist significant discrepancies in the dependence of {\HI} and star formation on the cosmic web and on redshift. TNG overpredicts the observed {\HI} fraction and relative sSFR at $z=0-0.5$, with the tension being strongest in the voids. CHILES observes a decline in the {\HI} fraction from filament cores to voids, exactly the opposite of the trend predicted by TNG. CHILES observes an increase in {\HI} fraction at $z=0.5\rightarrow0$ in the voids, while TNG predicts an increase in this time in all environments. Further dividing the sample into stellar mass bins, we find that the {\HI} in ${\logms}&gt;10$ galaxies is better reproduced by TNG than {\HI} in ${\logms}=9-10$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>The DECam MAGIC Survey: A Wide-field Photometric Metallicity Study of the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metallicity distribution function and internal chemical variations of a galaxy are fundamental to understand its formation and assembly history. In this work, we analyze photometric metallicities for 3883 stars over seven half-light radii ($\rm r_h$) in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (Scl dSph) galaxy, using new narrow-band imaging data from the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey conducted with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the 4-m Blanco Telescope. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of MAGIC using the Scl dSph galaxy, one of the most well-studied satellites of the Milky Way. Our sample ranges from $\rm [Fe/H] \approx - 4.0$ to $\rm [Fe/H] \approx - 0.6$, includes six extremely metal-poor candidates ($\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$) without previous spectroscopic observations, and is almost three times larger than the largest spectroscopic metallicity dataset in the Scl dSph. Our spatially unbiased sample of metallicities provides a more accurate representation of the metallicity distribution function, revealing a more metal-rich peak than observed in the most recent spectroscopic sample. It also reveals a break in the metallicity gradient, with a strong change in the slope: from $-3.35 \pm 0.18 \rm \ dex \, deg^{-1}$ for stars inside $\sim 1\ \rm r_h$ to $-0.56 \pm 0.26 \rm \ dex \, deg^{-1}$ for the outer part of the Scl dSph. Our study demonstrates that combining photometric metallicity analysis with the wide field of view of DECam offers an efficient and unbiased approach for studying the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in the carbon monoxide (CO) line emission across the Milky Way's disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) line emission anisotropy across the Milky Way's disk to examine the effect of stellar feedback and Galactic dynamics on the distribution of the dense interstellar medium. The Hessian matrix method is used to characterize the CO line emission distribution and identify the preferential orientation across line-of-sight velocity channels in the Dame et al. 2001 composite Galactic plane survey, which covers the Galactic latitude range $|b|&lt;5^{\circ}$. The structures sampled with this tracer are predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane toward the inner Galaxy, in clear contrast with the predominantly perpendicular orientation of the structures traced by neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) emission toward the same regions. The analysis of the Galactic plane portions sampled at higher angular resolution with other surveys reveals that the alignment with the Galactic plane is also prevalent at smaller scales. We find no preferential orientation in the CO emission toward the outer Galaxy, in contrast with the preferential alignment with the Galactic plane displayed by HI in that portion of the Milky Way. We interpret these results as the combined effect of the decrease in mid-plane pressure with increasing Galactocentric radius and SN feedback lifting diffuse gas more efficiently than dense gas off the Galactic plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct linear analyses of convection in domains larger than the temperature scale height. We employ both analytical and numerical methods in these analyses. In the case excluding all dissipation, the typical time scale of convection is determined by the free fall time over the temperature scale height. We quantitatively show the condition for the Boussinesq and Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximations to be applicable. We provide a reassessment of the critical Rayleigh number, a key indicator of convection, and show that WKB approximation tends to underestimate the critical Rayleigh number, particularly when the temperature scale height is comparable to or smaller than the domain height. We show clear explanation why both thermal conduction and viscosity are required for stabilizing negative entropy gradient medium.</description>

      <title>The Scale for the Expansion of the Universe: From Local Structures to Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study tackles the impact dark energy in different systems by a simple unifying formalism. We introduce a parameter space to compare gravity tests across all cosmic scales, using the McVittie spacetime (MCV), that connect spherically symmetric solutions with cosmological solutions. By analyzing invariant scalars, the Ricci, Weyl, and Kretschmann scalars, we develop a phase-space description that predicts the dominance of the Cosmological Constant. We explore three cases: (1) the local Hubble flow around galaxy groups and clusters, (2) spherical density distributions and (3) binary motion. Our results show that galaxy groups and clusters exhibit Kretschmann scalar values consistent with the Cosmological Constant curvature, indicating where dark energy dominates.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical versus Theoretical Stellar Population Models: a comparison with Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models are a key tool for deriving the age, metallicity, radial velocity and reddening of star clusters from their integrated spectra. Using a sample of 129 star clusters with high-quality spectra, we analyze the uncertainties associated with selecting an empirical versus a theoretical stellar spectral library in the SPS models. We find that the fits from the different models agree on the goodness of fit metrics and inferred reddening. However, the derived age and metallicity can be affected by the choice of the stellar library, with synthetic libraries tending to give lower age and metallicity, especially for spectra with low SNR. Ages and reddening values from SSP-equivalent fits are consistent with the multi-population fits, however, SSP-equivalent metallicities are affected by the coarse coverage of the SPS grid in [Fe/H]. When comparing the spectral fitting results with the literature, we find that (1) all models underestimate age for old and metal-poor systems; (2) on average, SPS models based on synthetic stellar libraries better match the isochrone ages and metallicities from high-resolution stellar spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: In resistive and viscous magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we obtain axial outflows launched from the innermost magnetosphere of a star-disk system. The launched outflows are found to be asymmetric. We find the part of the parameter space corresponding to quasi-stationary axial outflows and compute the mass load and angular momentum flux in such outflows. We display the obtained geometry of the solutions and measure the speed of propagation and rotation of the obtained axial outflows.</description>

      <title>The Binary Fraction of Red Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs), as the descendants of OB-type stars and the progenitors of supernovae, provide crucial insights into the evolution of massive stars, particularly in binary systems. Previous studies show that the binary fraction of RSGs ($\approx$ 15% - 40%) is significantly lower than that of their predecessors ($\approx$ 50% - 70%). In this work, we investigate the binary fraction of RSGs with the recently selected largest samples of 4695 and 2097 RSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), respectively. The binary system with a hot companion (O-, B- and A-type star) is identified by detecting the ultraviolet (UV) excess in the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from ultraviolet to mid-infrared after subtracting the model SED of RSG since RSGs are very weak in the UV band. It is found that the lower limit of binarity is 30.2% $\pm$ 0.7% and 32.2% $\pm$ 1% in the LMC and SMC, respectively. If the sample is limited to luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} &gt; 4.0$, the binary fraction becomes 26.6% $\pm$ 1.1% and 26.4% $\pm$ 1.7% in the LMC and SMC, respectively. The derived binary fraction is valid in the range of $\sim$ 2.3 &lt; $\log P / [\text{d}]$ &lt; $\sim$ 8. Our study suggests that roughly one-third of massive stars host a third companion within $\sim$ 30,000 AU. In addition, 15 RSGs are also identified as binary via HST/STIS spectra, and a handful of the binaries identified by the SED fitting are confirmed by their light curve and radial velocity dispersion. The stellar parameters of the companions, i.e. $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $R$, $L$ and log $g$, are calculated by model fitting.</description>

      <title>Capturing Small-Scale Reionization Physics: A Sub-Grid Model for Photon Sinks with SCRIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.</description>

      <title>Volume-limited sample of low-mass red giant stars, the progenitors of hot subdwarf stars II. Sample validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the progenitors of long-period hot subdwarf B (sdB) binaries, which form when low-mass red giant branch (RGB) stars lose their envelopes through stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOV) near the tip of the RGB. We aim to expand our previous volume-limited sample of 211 stars within 200 pc to 500 pc and validate it. Additionally, our goal is to provide the distribution of stellar parameters for these stars. We refined the original sample using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and interstellar extinction measurements. High-resolution spectra for 230 stars were obtained between 2019 and 2023 using the CORALIE spectrograph. To confirm or discard binarity, we combined astrometric parameters from Gaia with the resulting radial velocity variations. We derived the distribution of stellar parameters using atmospheric and evolutionary models, confirming that 82% of stars in our sample are indeed RGB stars using the equivalent evolutionary phase. The remaining 18% are red clump (RC) contaminants, which was expected due to the overlapping of RGB and RC stars in the colour-magnitude diagram. Additionally, 75% of the confirmed RGB stars have a high probability of being part of a binary system. Comparison with the literature shows good overall agreement with a scatter $\lesssim 15\%$ in stellar parameters, while the masses show somewhat higher dispersion ($\sim 20\%$).</description>

      <title>The Poisson noise in modeling the redshift-space distortion at large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the errors in modeling the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect at large linear scales, using data from the Millennium simulation. While standard theoretical templates, such as the Kaiser formula and the TNS method, could precisely model RSD for individual large-scale modes, we find that for tracers with number densities lower than $\sim10^{-3}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, there is a few-percent level bias in the predicted power spectrum. This error arises due to the amplification of intrinsic Poisson noise during RSD modeling from real-space power spectrum. This amplified noise can be analytically expressed as $1 + \epsilon/[{\bar{n}P}({1+\epsilon})]$, with $\epsilon=2\beta/3+\beta^2/5$, where $P$ denotes the real-space tracer power spectrum and $\beta \equiv f/b$. Specifically, for halos with a number density of around $5\times10^{-4}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, this phenomenon results in an additional systematic error of 2.5\%. Our result suggests that caution should be exercised when modeling the RSD directly using real-space power spectra of tracers measured from simulations or from the real surveys. This is relevant, e.g., in situations where the real-space tracer power spectrum is predicted by emulators trained using simulation data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the AI Cosmologist, an agentic system designed to automate cosmological/astronomical data analysis and machine learning research workflows. This implements a complete pipeline from idea generation to experimental evaluation and research dissemination, mimicking the scientific process typically performed by human researchers. The system employs specialized agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis that work together to develop novel approaches. Unlike traditional auto machine-learning systems, the AI Cosmologist generates diverse implementation strategies, writes complete code, handles execution errors, analyzes results, and synthesizes new approaches based on experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the AI Cosmologist capabilities across several machine learning tasks, showing how it can successfully explore solution spaces, iterate based on experimental results, and combine successful elements from different approaches. Our results indicate that agentic systems can automate portions of the research process, potentially accelerating scientific discovery. The code and experimental data used in this paper are available on GitHub at https://github.com/adammoss/aicosmologist. Example papers included in the appendix demonstrate the system's capability to autonomously produce complete scientific publications, starting from only the dataset and task description</description>

      <title>Coupling hydrodynamics with comoving frame radiative transfer. III. The wind regime of early-type B hypergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. B hypergiants (BHGs) are important for understanding high-mass stellar evolution. While they are in a similar parameter space of B supergiants (BSGs), some BHGs are known to be luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their spectra with absorption and emission features resemble Of/WNh stars. Yet, their wind physics and their evolutionary connections are not clear. Aims. In this study, we aim to understand (i) the atmospheric and wind structure, (ii) the wind-launching and -driving mechanisms, and (iii) the spectrum formation of early-type BHGs. As an observational prototype, we use zet1 Sco (B1.5Ia+). Methods. Using the atmosphere code PoWRhd, we calculated the first hydrodynamically consistent models at the BHG domain. They give insights into the radiative driving of the calculated wind regimes and enable us to study the influence of clumping and X-rays on the resulting wind structure. Results. Our consistent model reproduces the main spectral features of zet1 Sco. The obtained mass-loss rate is higher than that of similar spectral type BSGs. However, the wind optical depth of BHGs is way below unity, making them less of a transition type. To reproduce zet1 Sco's spectrum, we needed low clumping with subsonic onset. The wind has a shallow-gradient velocity profile, deviating from the beta law, and is mainly driven by Fe III opacity. Conclusions. Our study suggests that despite more mass loss, early-type Galactic BHGs have winds relatively similar to BSGs. Their winds are not thick enough to characterize them as "transition-type" stars, unlike Of/WNh, implying that emission features arise more easily in cooler than in hotter stars. The spectral BHG appearance is likely connected to atmospheric inhomogeneities below the sonic point. To reach an appearance similar to LBVs, BHGs need to be either closer to the Eddington limit or have higher wind clumping than inferred for zeta1 Sco.</description>

      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Do Red Galaxies Form More Stars Than Blue Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new model is proposed in which typical galaxies form most of their stellar mass in a phase with an intrinsically red stellar population. In the standard picture, galaxies with intrinsically red stellar populations are believed to have old stellar populations, so that only galaxies with blue stellar populations have significant star formation, and subsequent changes to the stellar population come from predominantly from aging and merging populations which have already formed. However, several observational puzzles have developed which are difficult to reconcile with this standard scenario. The most massive blue star-forming galaxies, presumed to be at the end of their stellar mass growth, are $\sim 1$ dex less massive, have a $\sim 1$ dex lower $M_*/M_{BH}$ ratio, and have a bottom-lighter IMF than local quiescent galaxies. Here, a new solution is proposed: at low temperature and high metallicity, galaxies can continue to form stars efficiently without being able to form O and B stars. These red star-forming galaxies would have many of the same properties of the population currently described as post-starburst galaxies, allowing a new interpretation of their origin. Finally, additional falsifiable observational predictions of this model are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Star formation rate density as a function of galaxy mass at z &lt; 0.2 with MUSE and GAMA surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The star formation rate density (SFRD) is an important tool in galaxy evolution that allows us to identify at which cosmic time galaxies are more efficient at forming stars. For low-mass star-forming galaxies, the SFRD as a function of stellar mass can be straightforwardly related to the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF). Given the uncertainty of the GSMF at the low-mass end, due to the challenges in observing dwarf galaxies, deriving the SFRD with respect to mass may be crucial to understand galaxy formation. Measurement of SFRD is more complete than number density in a cosmological volume because galaxies with higher SFR are easier to detect and characterize. In this work, the SFRD is derived using two different samples, one using the MUSE WIDE and MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field IFU spectroscopic surveys, and another using the GAMA spectroscopic survey. The first sample comprised a total of 27 star-forming galaxies at z $&lt;$ 0.2 (H$\alpha$ selected), whereas the second contained 7579 galaxies at z $&lt;$ 0.06 ($r$-band selected). The star formation rates are derived from measurements of the H$\alpha$ emission line fluxes for the first sample, and using MagPhys SED fitting for the second one. The results show the behaviour of the SFRD to the lowest stellar masses of 10$^{5.5}$ $M_{\odot}$, consistent with a constant slope (in log SFRD versus log stellar mass) and thus no turn-over in the GSMF. The results also suggest that the volume considered for the MUSE WIDE and HUDF sample is underdense.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities</title>

Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints of Radial Migration in the Galactic Disc Driven by the Slowing Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radial migration is an important dynamical effect that has reshaped the Galactic disc, but its origin has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we present evidence that resonant dragging by the corotation of a decelerating bar could be the main driver of radial migration in the Milky Way disc. Using a test particle simulation, we demonstrate this scenario explains the two distinct age-metallicity sequences observed in the solar vicinity: the plateauing upper sequence is interpreted as stars dragged outwards by the expanding corotation of the decelerating bar and the steeper lower sequence as stars formed locally around the solar circle. The upper migrated sequence dominates at guiding radii around the current corotation radius of the bar, $R\sim7\,\mathrm{kpc}$, but rapidly dies away beyond this where the mechanism cannot operate. This behaviour naturally explains the radial dependence of the $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-bimodality, in particular the truncation of the high-$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc beyond the solar circle. Under our proposed radial migration scenario, we constrain the Milky Way bar's pattern speed evolution using the age-metallicity distribution of stars currently trapped at corotation. We find the bar likely formed with an initial pattern speed of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and began decelerating $6-8$ Gyr ago at a rate $-\dot{\Omega}/\Omega^2\sim0.0025-0.0040$ (where the quoted ranges include systematic uncertainties).</description>

      <title>Testing the local void solution to the Hubble tension using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_{\mathrm{V}}$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the homogeneous model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 42 considered $D_{\mathrm{V}}$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 75.7 for the void-free model, while the void models give only $47.3 - 51.2$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.3\sigma$ without a void to $1.1\sigma - 1.4\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth. The void-free model provides the worst fit in almost every case. Overall, our results suggest that recent evidence of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2011-BLG-0462: An Isolated Stellar-Mass Black Hole Confirmed Using New HST Astrometry and Updated Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-duration Galactic-bulge microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 produced relativistic astrometric deflections of the source star, which we measured using HST observations taken at 8 epochs over ~6 years. Analysis of the microlensing light curve and astrometry led our group (followed by other independent groups) to conclude that the lens is an isolated stellar-mass black hole (BH) -- the first and only one unambiguously discovered to date. There have now been three additional epochs of HST observations, increasing the astrometric time baseline to 11 years. Additionally, the ground-based OGLE data have been updated. We have re-analyzed the data, including the new HST astrometry, and photometry obtained with 16 different telescopes. The source lies only 0.4 arcsec from a bright neighbor, making it crucial to perform precise subtraction of its point-spread function (PSF) in the astrometric measurements of the source. Moreover, we show that it is essential to perform a separate PSF subtraction for each individual HST frame as part of the reductions. Our final solution yields a lens mass of 7.15 +/- 0.83 solar mass. Combined with the lack of detected light from the lens at late HST epochs, the BH nature of the lens is conclusively verified. The BH lies at a distance of 1.52 +/- 0.15 kpc, and is moving with a space velocity of 51.1 +/- 7.5 km/s relative to the stars in the neighborhood. We compare our results with those of other studies and discuss reasons for the differences. We searched for binary companions of the BH at a range of separations but found no evidence for any.</description>
