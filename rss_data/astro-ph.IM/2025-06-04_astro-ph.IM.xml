      <title>COSMOS-Web: Comprehensive Data Reduction for Wide-Area JWST NIRCam Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the data reduction methodology used for the COSMOS-Web survey JWST NIRCam data. Covering 0.54 deg^2 with four broadband filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) and a total exposure time of approximately 270 hours, COSMOS-Web represents the largest contiguous field surveyed during JWST Cycle 1, posing unique data reduction challenges due to its extensive scale. By combining the official JWST Calibration Pipeline with custom improvements for noise removal, background subtraction, and astrometric alignment, we achieve high fidelity science-ready mosaics. We detail the systematic approach employed in the three stages of the JWST Calibration Pipeline. The data, collected in three epochs from January 2023 to January 2024, encompass 152 visits and have been processed into 20 mosaic tiles to optimize computational efficiency and data processing. The final data products achieve 5 sigma depths of 26.7-28.3 AB mag in 0.15" apertures. The processed and calibrated datasets are made available to the public.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Stacks in the Stacked Hilbert-Huang Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) consists of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is a template-free method that represents the combination of different intrinsic modes on a time-frequency map (i.e., the Hilbert spectrum). The application of HHT involves introducing trials by imposing white noise on the signal and then calculating the ensemble mean process of the corresponding EMD to demonstrate its significance on the Hilbert spectrum. In this study, we develop a stacked Hilbert-Huang Transform (sHHT) method that generates the Hilbert spectrum for each trial and compiles all results to enhance the strength of the real instantaneous frequency of the main signal on the time-frequency map. This new approach is more sensitive to detecting/tracing the nonlinear and transient features of a signal embedded in astronomical databases than the conventional HHT, particularly when the signal experiences dramatic frequency changes in a short time. We analytically investigate the consistency of HHT and sHHT and perform numerical simulations to examine the dispersion of the instantaneous frequency obtained through sHHT and compare its advantages and effectiveness with those of conventional HHT. To confirm the feasibility of the sHHT, we demonstrate its application in verifying the signal of superorbital modulation in X-ray and binary black hole mergers in gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Lens based Kinetic Inductance Detectors with Distributed Dual Polarised Absorbers for Far Infra-red Space-based Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future space-based far infra-red astronomical observations require background limited detector sensitivities and scalable focal plane array solutions to realise their vast potential in observation speed. In this work, a focal plane array of lens absorber coupled Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) is proposed to fill this role. The figures of merit and design guidelines for the proposed detector concept are derived by employing a previously developed electromagnetic spectral modelling technique. Two designs operating at central frequencies of $6.98$ and $12$ THz are studied. A prototype array of the former is fabricated, and its performance is experimentally determined and validated. Specifically, the optical coupling of the detectors to incoherent distributed sources (i.e. normalised throughput) is quantified experimentally with good agreement with the estimations provided by the model. The coupling of the lens absorber prototypes to an incident plane wave, i.e. aperture efficiency, is also indirectly validated experimentally matching the expected value of $54\%$ averaged over two polarisation. The noise equivalent power of the KIDs are also measured with limiting value of $8\times10^{-20}$ $\mathrm{W/\sqrt{Hz}}$.</description>

      <title>Germanium Atomic Compton Scattering Measurements and ${ab}$ ${initio}$ Many-Body Calculations: Implications for Electronic recoil Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse searches for direct dark matter (DM) in effective electromagnetic and leptophilic interactions resulting from new physics, as well as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with unconventional electronic recoils, are intensively pursued. Low-energy backgrounds from radioactive $\gamma$ rays via Compton scattering and photon coherent scattering are unavoidable in terrestrial detectors. The interpretation of dark matter experimental data is dependent on a better knowledge of the background in the low-energy region. We provide a 2.3% measurement of atomic Compton scattering in the low momentum transfer range of 180 eV/c to 25 keV/c, using a 10-g germanium detector bombarded by a $^{137}\mathrm{Cs}$ source with a 7.2 m-Curie radioactivity and the scatter photon collected by a cylindrical NaI[Tl] detector. The ability to detect Compton scattering's doubly differential cross section (DDCS) gives a special test for clearly identifying the kinematic restraints in atomic many-body systems, notably the Livermore model. Additionally, a low-energy-background comparison is made between coherent photon scattering and Compton scattering replacing the scattering function of ${GEANT4}$@software, which uses a completely relativistic impulse approximation (RIA) together with Multi-Configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) wavefunctions. For the purpose of investigating sub-GeV mass and electronic-recoil dark matter theories, signatures including low energy backgrounds via high energy $\gamma$ rays in germanium targets are discussed.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Cross Polarization Ratio maps from all-sky observations with the SKA-Low prototype station Aperture Array Verification System 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-frequency radio telescope of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low), currently under construction in the remote Murchison shire in the Western Australia's outback, will observe the sky between 50 MHz and 350 MHz with unprecedented sensitivity and stringent requirements for polarization accuracy. In this work, we investigate the instrumental polarization purity of a SKA-Low prototype station by means of the Intrinsic Cross-Polarization Ratio (IXR) figure of merit. We derive all-sky experimental IXR maps using data from the Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2). The results are presented at three frequencies within the SKA-Low bandwidth (110, 160, and 230 MHz) with a quantitative comparison between observed and simulated all-sky IXR maps. Our findings show good agreement in IXR map distributions and promising consistency in their radial profiles, meeting SKA-Low's IXR specification overall. This study offers an empirical approach to verifying SKA-Low's polarization performance using all-sky observations from individual stations and will potentially support the telescope's early science commissioning phase.</description>

      <title>GRAVITY+ adaptive optics (GPAO) tests in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in this proceeding the results of the test phase of the GRAVITY+ adaptive optics. This extreme AO will enable both high-dynamic range observations of faint companions (including exoplanets) thanks to a 40x40 sub-apertures wavefront control, and sensitive observations (including AGNs) thanks to the addition of a laser guide star to each UT of the VLT. This leap forward is made thanks to a mostly automated setup of the AO, including calibration of the NCPAs, that we tested in Europe on the UT+atmosphere simulator we built in Nice. We managed to reproduce in laboratory the expected performances of all the modes of the AO, including under non-optimal atmospheric or telescope alignment conditions, giving us the green light to proceed with the Assembly, Integration and Verification phase in Paranal.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Nuclear Recoils in Silicon Crystals towards Single Electron-Hole Pair Ionization Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a novel methodology utilizing molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the ionization yields of nuclear recoils in crystalline silicon. This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.</description>

      <title>L-BASS: A project to produce an absolutely calibrated 1.4 GHz sky map. II -- Technical Description of the System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L-BASS is an instrument designed to make radiometric temperature measurements of the sky with an absolute accuracy of better than 0.1 K at 1.4 GHz. This will be achieved in two steps: first by measuring the sky temperature relative to that of the North Celestial Pole, using two horn-based antennas, and second with the sky antenna replaced with a calibrated cryogenic load to measure the absolute brightness temperature of the North Celesial Pole. Here we describe the design of the L-BASS two-antenna system and report on laboratory measurements to establish its performance at component and sub-system level.</description>

      <title>Time domain astrophysics with transient sources. Delay estimate via Cross Correlation Function techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The timing analysis of transient events allows for investigating numerous still open areas of modern astrophysics. The article explores all the mathematical and physical tools required to estimate delays and associated errors between two Times of Arrival (ToA) lists, by exploiting Cross Correlation Function (CCF) techniques. The CCF permits the establishment of the delay between two observed signals and is defined on two continuous functions. A detector does not directly measure the intensity of the electromagnetic signal (interacting with its material) but rather detects each photon ToA through a probabilistic process. Since the CCF is defined on continuous functions, the crucial step is to obtain a continuous rate curve from a list of ToA. This step is treated in the article and the constructed rate functions are light curves that are continuous functions. This allows, in principle, the estimation of delays with any desired resolution. Due to the statistical nature of the measurement process, two independent detections of the same signal yield different photon times. Consequently, light curves derived from these lists differ due to Poisson fluctuations, leading the CCF between them to fluctuate around the true theoretical delay. This article describes a Monte Carlo technique that enables reliable delay estimation by providing a robust measure of the uncertainties induced by Poissonian fluctuations. GRB data are considered as they offer optimal test cases for the proposed techniques. The developed techniques provides a significant computational advantage and are useful analyzing of data characterized by low-count statistics (i.e., low photon count rates in c/s), as they allow overcoming the limitations associated with traditional fixed bin-size methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the delivery to the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) of tables containing Root Mean Square (RMS) Combined Differential Photometric Precision (CDPP) values for all TESS 2-min cadence targets with Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) light curves in Sectors 1-90. Each comma-separated values (CSV) file contains CDPP values for all 2-min light curves in the given sector. The tables include robust RMS CDPP values for the 15 trial transit pulse durations searched in the SPOC 2-min processing pipeline, ranging from 0.5-15.0 hr. For each pulse duration, CDPP is computed in the transit search for a trial transit centered on every cadence. The RMS value of the CDPP time series is a metric that may be employed to estimate signal-to-noise ratio for transits with the given duration and a specified depth. We will continue to deliver the RMS CDPP tables to MAST for each observing sector.</description>

      <title>New Rotation Periods from the Kepler Bonus Background Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kepler field hosts the best studied sample of field star rotation periods. However, due to Kepler's large 4" pixels, many of its light curves are at high risk of contamination from background sources. The new Kepler Bonus Background light curves are de-blended using a PSF algorithm, providing light curves of over 400,000 new background sources in addition to over 200,000 re-analyzed Kepler prime targets. These light curves provide the opportunity to search for new rotation periods. Here we apply a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic spot-modulated light curves to regress rotation periods from the Kepler Bonus light curves. We obtained periods for 32,159 total sources, 19,650 of which had previously been measured and 9,811 of which are new periods for both Kepler prime and background sources. Our method also detected 608 pulsation frequencies from asteroseismic oscillations in red giants. We validate our Kepler prime periods against literature values and present the full period sample. We find excellent agreement with previously-known literature periods, validating deep learning as a viable class of period determination methods. Comparing the periods and light curves of foreground-background pairs, we find that as many as 63% of periodic background light curves are still blended with the foreground, highlighting limitations of the de-blending technique.</description>

Abstract: The NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program service are two widely used resources for the exoplanet community. The NASA Exoplanet Archive provides a complete and accurate accounting of exoplanetary systems published by NASA missions and by the community in the refereed literature. In anticipation of continued exponential growth in the number of exoplanetary systems, and the increasing complexity in our characterization of these systems, the NASA Exoplanet Archive has restructured its primary tables and interfaces, as well as extending and standardizing their modes of access. The Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program service provides the exoplanet community with a venue for coordinating and sharing follow-up and precursor data for exoplanets, their host stars, and stars that might eventually be targets for future planet searches, and recently reached one million files uploaded by the community. In this paper we describe the updates to our data holdings, functionality, accessibility, and tools, as well as future priorities for these two services.</description>

      <title>Probing the accretion geometry of black hole X-ray binaries: A multi-mission spectro-polarimetric and timing study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-polarimetric and timing analysis of eleven black hole X-ray binaries, namely Cyg X-1, 4U 1630-47, Cyg X-3, LMC X-1, 4U 1957+115, LMC X-3, Swift J1727.8-1613, GX 339-4, Swift J151857.0-572147, IGR J17091-3624, and MAXI J1744-294, using quasi-simultaneous observations from {\it IXPE}, {\it NICER}, {\it NuSTAR}, and {\it AstroSat}. Timing analyses reveal characteristic type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) across different spectral states, often associated with episodic radio ejections. Broadband ($0.7-60$ keV) spectral modelling, employing disc, Comptonization, and reflection components, reveals degeneracies in constraining disc-corona geometries. Polarimetric measurements in 2-8 keV band detect significant polarization degrees (PDs) ranging from $3-20.6\%$ ($1.2-21.4\%$) in harder (softer) states, with moderate to strong energy dependence, except for LMC X-1, Swift J151857.0-572147, and MAXI J1744-294, where no significant polarization is detected. We report the polarization detections of Cyg X-3 (PD $\sim 21.4\%$, SIMS), LMC X-3 (PD $\sim 2.4\%$, HSS) and IGR J17091-3624 (PD $\sim 9\%$, LHS) using the recent {\it IXPE} observations. A positive correlation is found between PD and the Comptonized photon fraction ($cov_{\rm frac}$), while an anti-correlation is observed with the disc-to-Comptonized flux ratio ($F_{\rm ratio}$) across spectral states. The combined timing, spectral, and polarimetric results, together with constraints from radio jet observations, suggest a radially extended corona within a truncated disc for Cyg X-1, Swift J1727.8-1613, IGR J17091-3624, and GX 339-4, whereas the disc-corona geometry remains unconstrained for 4U 1957+115, LMC X-3, and 4U 1630-47. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding accretion geometries and highlight prospects for future X-ray polarimetric studies.</description>

      <title>Quasioptic, Calibrated, Full 2-port Measurements of Cryogenic Devices under Vacuum in the 220-330 GHz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-optical (QO) test bench was designed, simulated, and calibrated for characterizing S-parameters of devices in the 220-330 GHz (WR-3.4) frequency range, from room temperature down to 4.8 K. The devices were measured through vacuum windows via focused beam radiation. A de-embedding method employing line-reflect-match (LRM) calibration was established to account for the effects of optical components and vacuum windows. The setup provides all four S-parameters with the reference plane located inside the cryostat, and achieves a return loss of 30 dB with an empty holder. System validation was performed with measurements of cryogenically cooled devices, such as bare silicon wafers and stainless-steel frequency-selective surface (FSS) bandpass filters, and superconducting bandpass FSS fabricated in niobium. A permittivity reduction of Si based on 4-GHz resonance shift was observed concomitant with a drop in temperature from 296 K to 4.8 K. The stainless steel FSS measurements revealed a relatively temperature invariant center frequency and return loss level of 263 GHz and 35 dB on average, respectively. Finally, a center frequency of 257 GHz was measured with the superconducting filters, with return loss improved by 7 dB on average at 4.8 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported attempt to scale LRM calibration to 330 GHz and use it to de-embed the impact of optics and cryostat from cryogenically cooled device S-parameters.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{BTSbot}$: A Multi-input Convolutional Neural Network to Automate and Expedite Bright Transient Identification for the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bright Transient Survey (BTS) relies on visual inspection ("scanning") to select sources for accomplishing its mission of spectroscopically classifying all bright extragalactic transients found by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We present $\texttt{BTSbot}$, a multi-input convolutional neural network, which provides a bright transient score to individual ZTF detections using their image data and 14 extracted features. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ eliminates the need for scanning by automatically identifying and requesting follow-up observations of new bright ($m\,&lt;18.5\,\mathrm{mag}$) transient candidates. $\texttt{BTSbot}$ outperforms BTS scanners in terms of completeness (99% vs. 95%) and identification speed (on average, 7.4 hours quicker).

      <title>Alignment and optical verification of DESHIMA 2.0 at ASTE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed, characterized, and verified an alignment procedure for the DESHIMA 2.0 instrument, an ultra wide-band spectrometer operating between 200--400 GHz, at the ASTE telescope. To this end, we mounted the warm optics, consisting of a modified Dragonian dual reflector system, on a motor controlled hexapod. Crucial in the alignment procedure is our sky chopper, which allows fast beam switching. It has a small entrance and exit aperture coupling to (cold) sky, which creates a measurable signal with respect to the warm cabin environment. By scanning the instrument beam across the entrance aperture of the sky chopper using the hexapod, we found the hexapod configuration that produced the lowest signal on our detectors, implying the beam is coupled fully to cold sky and not the warm cabin. We first characterized the alignment procedure in the laboratory, where we used a vat containing liquid nitrogen as the cold source behind the sky chopper. Then, we applied the alignment procedure to DESHIMA 2.0 at ASTE. We found that the alignment procedure significantly improved the aperture efficiency compared to previously reported values of the aperture efficiency of DESHIMA at ASTE, which indicates the veracity of the alignment procedure.</description>

      <title>Fractal algorithm for multiple lens analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A microlensing exoplanet search is a unique method for finding planets orbiting distant stars. However, in the past, the method used to analyze microlensing data could not deal with complex lens systems. The number of lenses was limited three or less. Positions calculations of images and integration of them suffered from severe round-off errors because of singularities. We developed a new algorithm to calculate the light curves of multiple lens systems. In this algorithm, fractal-like consecutive self-similar division (SSD) is used to find sparse images. SSD is also useful for integrating images to efficiently obtain magnifications. The new algorithm does not use root finding for the lens equation and is free from caustic singularities. There is no limit on the number of lenses. Compared to inverse-ray shooting, this method dramatically improves the computing time. The calculation can be adjusted to obtain either a high-precision final result or high-speed quick result. Although this new algorithm was developed for a microlensing planet search, its application to quasar microlensing is also expected. This paper discusses problems in the modeling of a multiple lens system and then presents the new algorithm in detail.</description>

      <title>Sequence modeling of higher-order wave modes of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order gravitational wave modes from quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers encode key information about these systems' nonlinear dynamics. We model these waveforms using transformer architectures, targeting the evolution from late inspiral through ringdown. Our data is derived from the \texttt{NRHybSur3dq8} surrogate model, which includes spherical harmonic modes up to $\ell \leq 4$ (excluding $(4,0)$, $(4,\pm1)$ and including $(5,5)$ modes). These waveforms span mass ratios $q \leq 8$, spin components $s^z_{{1,2}} \in [-0.8, 0.8]$, and inclination angles $\theta \in [0, \pi]$. The model processes input data over the time interval $t \in [-5000\textrm{M}, -100\textrm{M})$ and generates predictions for the plus and cross polarizations, $(h_{+}, h_{\times})$, over the interval $t \in [-100\textrm{M}, 130\textrm{M}]$. Utilizing 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on the Delta supercomputer, we trained the transformer model in 15 hours on over 14 million samples. The model's performance was evaluated on a test dataset of 840,000 samples, achieving mean and median overlap scores of 0.996 and 0.997, respectively, relative to the surrogate-based ground truth signals. We further benchmark the model on numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, finding that it generalizes well to out-of-distribution systems, capable of reproducing the dynamics of systems with mass ratios up to $q=15$ and spin magnitudes up to 0.998, with a median overlap of 0.969 across 521 NR waveforms and up to 0.998 in face-on/off configurations. These results demonstrate that transformer-based models can capture the nonlinear dynamics of binary black hole mergers with high accuracy, even outside the surrogate training domain, enabling fast sequence modeling of higher-order wave modes.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Systematic Transient Search of Single Observation Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic search for astrophysical transients using data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). The data were taken from 2017 to 2022 in three frequency bands spanning 77 GHz to 277 GHz. In this paper we present a pipeline for transient detection using single observation maps where each pixel of a map contains one observation with an integration time of approximately four minutes. We detect 34 transient events at 27 unique locations. All but two of the transients are associated with Galactic stars and exhibit a wide range of properties. We also detect an event coincident with the classical nova YZ Ret and one event consistent with a flaring active galactic nucleus. We notably do not detect any reverse shock emission from gamma ray bursts, a non-detection that may be in tension with current models.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>

Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial velocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were established by Karachentsev &amp; Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background cosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the total radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies having small angular separations $\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to ca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and tangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more than 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\theta &lt; 10$ deg, the infall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we found the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However, the infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial velocity dispersion. Observed under $\theta &lt; 10$ deg the velocity dispersion inferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even coincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups and clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity dispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,min}} = (180 \pm 42)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$, from the major infall model (lower bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,maj}} = (142 \pm 64) ~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{r,\Delta v} = (99 \pm 36)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.</description>

      <title>AstroVisBench: A Code Benchmark for Scientific Computing and Visualization in Astronomy</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature, answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.</description>
