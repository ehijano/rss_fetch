      <title>Machine learning meets $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra: Enhancing quantum dynamics learning with exact trace conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool for simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. However, existing methods often struggle to enforce key physical constraints, such as trace conservation, when modeling reduced density matrices (RDMs). While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) aim to address these challenges, they frequently fail to achieve full physical consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra to represent RDMs as a combination of an identity matrix and $n^2 - 1$ Hermitian, traceless, and orthogonal basis operators,where $n$ is the system's dimension. By learning only the coefficients associated with this basis, our framework inherently ensures exact trace conservation, as the traceless nature of the basis restricts the trace contribution solely to the identity matrix. This eliminates the need for explicit trace-preserving penalty terms in the loss function, simplifying optimization and improving learning efficiency. We validate our approach on two benchmark quantum systems: the spin-boson model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. By comparing the performance of four neural network (NN) architectures -- Purely Data-driven Physics-Uninformed Neural Networks (PUNN), $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra-based PUNN ($\mathfrak{su}(n)$-PUNN), traditional PINN, and $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra-based PINN ($\mathfrak{su}(n)$-PINN) -- we highlight the limitations of conventional methods and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in learning quantum dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Triplet J-driven DNP, a proposal to increase the sensitivity of solution-state NMR without microwave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an important method to enhance the limited sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Using the existing mechanisms such as Overhauser DNP (ODNP) is still difficult to achieve significant enhancement of NMR signals in solutions at a high magnetic field. The recently proposed J-driven DNP (JDNP) condition (when the exchange interaction of two electron spins matches their Lamour frequency) may enable signal enhancement in solution as it requires only dipolar interaction between the biradical polarization agent and the analyte. However, likewise ODNP, the current JDNP strategy still requires the saturation of the electron polarization with high microwave power which has poor penetration and is associated with heating effects in most liquids. The replacement of high-power microwave irradiation is possible if the temporal electron polarization imbalance is created by a different wavelength such as the visible light. Here, we propose a triplet JDNP mechanism which first exploits the light-induced singlet fission process (i.e., a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet excitons). As the JDNP condition is fulfilled, a triplet-to-triplet cross-relaxation process will occur with different rates and consequently lead to the creation of hyperpolarization on the coupled nuclear spin states. This communication discusses the theory behind the triplet JDNP proposal, as well as the polarizing agents and conditions that will enable the new approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR without the need of microwave irradiation.</description>

      <title>Fermionic free energies from \textit{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations of fictitious identical particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the recent $\eta-$ensemble path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach to the free energy [T.~Dornheim \textit{et al.}, \textit{Phys.~Rev.~B} \textbf{111}, L041114 (2025)] with a recent fictitious partition function technique based on inserting a continuous variable that interpolates between the bosonic and fermionic limits [Xiong and Xiong, \textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)] to deal with the fermion sign problem. As a practical example, we apply our set-up to the warm dense uniform electron gas over a broad range of densities and temperatures. We obtain accurate results for the exchange--correlation free energy down to half the Fermi temperature, and find excellent agreement with the state-of-the-art parametrization by Groth \textit{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)]. Our work opens up new avenues for the future study of a host of interacting Fermi-systems, including warm dense matter, ultracold atoms, and electrons in quantum dots.</description>

      <title>A toolbox of spin-adapted generalized Pauli constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a toolbox for studying and applying spin-adapted generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) in few-electron quantum systems. By exploiting the spin symmetry of realistic $N$-electron wave functions, the underlying one-body pure $N$-representability problem simplifies, allowing us to calculate the GPCs for larger system sizes than previously accessible. We then uncover and rigorously prove a superselection rule that highlights the significance of GPCs: whenever a spin-adapted GPC is (approximately) saturated - referred to as (quasi)pinning - the corresponding $N$-electron wave function assumes a simplified structure. Specifically, in a configuration interaction expansion based on natural orbitals only very specific spin configuration state functions may contribute. To assess the nontriviality of (quasi)pinning, we introduce a geometric measure that contrasts it with the (quasi)pinning induced by simple (spin-adapted) Pauli constraints. Applications to few-electron systems suggest that previously observed quasipinning largely stems from spin symmetries.</description>

      <title>Exposing a Fatal Flaw in Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr\"odinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we show that QSCI methods face fundamental limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality CI expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a fatal flaw in QSCI methods as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Derivation and thermodynamically consistent coupling of a Debye-H\"uckel type energy to a steric electrolyte model and application to the apparent molar volume and phase boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a Debye-H\"uckel-like model of the electric ion-ion interaction for non-constant dielectric susceptibility, which does not depend on any kind of charging process due to its foundation in the general framework of non-equilibrium electro-thermodynamics. The derivation, however, leads to a novel thermodynamic consistency condition for the temperature dependence of the susceptibility. Due to its contributions to the total pressure, the consistent coupling of this new contribution to the free energy requires subtle modifications in the derivation of the simple mixture model for electrolytes. The coupled model is then applied to the apparent molar volume for various related monovalent salts over a wider range of salt concentrations and temperatures, and classical tests of the electrolyte theory at phase boundaries are investigated.</description>

      <title>Infinite variety of thermodynamic speed limits with general activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. This unification is based on generalized means that include standard means such as the arithmetic, logarithmic, and geometric means, the first two of which respectively correspond to the dynamical activity and the dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks using different activities. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</description>
