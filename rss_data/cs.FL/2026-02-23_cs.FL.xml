      <title>History-Constrained Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study verification problems for history-constrained systems (HCS), a model of guarded computation that uses nested systems. An outer system describes the process architecture in which a sequence of actions represents the communication between sub-systems through a global bus. Actions are either permitted or blocked locally by guards; these guards read and decide based on the sequence of actions so far in the global bus.
  When HCS have both the outer systems and the local guard controllers modelled by finite automata, we show they have the same expressive power as regular languages and finite automata, but they are exponentially more succinct. We also analyse games on this model, representing the interaction between environment and controller, and show that solving such games is EXPTIME-complete, where the lower bound already holds for reachability/safety games and the upper bound holds for any $\omega$-regular winning condition. Finally, we consider HCS with guards of greater expressive power, Vector Addition Systems with States (VASS). We show that with deterministic coverability-VASS guards the reachability problem is EXPSPACE-complete, while with reachability-VASS the problem is undecidable.</description>

      <title>On A. V. Anisimov's problem for finding a polynomial algorithm checking inclusion of context-free languages in group languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work investigates the problem of whether a context-free language is a subset of a group language. A.~V. Anisimov has shown that the problem of determining the unambiguity of finite automata is a special case of this problem. Then the question of finding polynomial algorithm verifying the inclusion of context-free languages in group languages naturally arises. The article focuses on this open problem. For the purpose, the paper describes an unconventional method of description of context-free languages, namely a representation with the help of a finite digraph whose arcs are labelled with a specially defined monoid $\mathcal{U}$. Also, we define a semiring $\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{U}$ whose elements are the set $2^\mathcal{U}$ of all subsets of $\mathcal{U}$ and with operations - product and union of the elements of $2^\mathcal{U}$. The described algorithm executes no more than $O(n^3)$ operations in $\mathcal{S}_\mathcal{U}$.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy Theorem for Automatic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) studies homomorphism problems between relational structures where the target structure is fixed. Classifying the complexity of these problems has been a central quest of the field, notably when both sides are finite structures. In this paper, we study the generalization where the input is an automatic structure -- potentially infinite, but describable by finite automata. We prove a striking dichotomy: homomorphism problems over automatic structures are either decidable in non-deterministic logarithmic space (NL), or undecidable. We show that structures for which the problem is decidable are exactly those with finite duality, which is a classical property of target structures asserting that the existence of a homomorphism into them can be characterized by the absence of a finite set of obstructions in the source structure. Notably, this property precisely characterizes target structures whose homomorphism problem is definable in first-order logic, which is well-known to be decidable over automatic structures. We also consider a natural variant of the problem. While automatic structures are finitely describable, homomorphisms from them into finite structures need not be. This leads to the notion of regular homomorphism, where the homomorphism itself must be describable by finite automata. Remarkably, we prove that this variant exhibits the same dichotomy, with the same characterization for decidability.</description>

      <title>Backward Responsibility in Transition Systems Beyond Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the complexity of software systems rises, methods for explaining their behaviour are becoming ever-more important. When a system fails, it is critical to determine which of its components are responsible for this failure. Within the verification community, one approach uses graph games and Shapley values to ascribe a responsibility value to every state of a transition system. As this is done with respect to a specific failure, it is called backward responsibility.
  This paper provides tight complexity bounds for the computation of backward responsibility values for reachability, B\"uchi and parity objectives. For B\"uchi objectives, a polynomial algorithm is given to determine the set of responsible states, i.e. states with positive responsibility value. To analyse systems that are too large for standard methods, the paper presents a novel refinement algorithm that iteratively finds the set of responsible states. Several heuristics are proposed to guide the refinement algorithm. Its utility is demonstrated with a tool that implements refinement in addition to several other responsibility computation techniques.</description>

      <title>FATE: A Formal Benchmark Series for Frontier Algebra of Multiple Difficulty Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</description>
