      <title>Exact Floquet flat band and heating suppression via two-rate drive protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of exact Floquet flat bands implying strong violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in a large class of closed quantum many-body systems in the presence of a two-rate drive characterized by frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2=\nu \Omega_1$. We provide the exact analytic condition for this phenomenon to occur for a generic protocol; in particular, $\nu=(2p+1)$, where $p$ is an integer, leads to such flat bands for both square-pulse and cosine drive protocols for arbitrary $\Omega_1$. In the vicinity of these points, heating is suppressed up to very long timescales in such driven systems, leading to a prethermal regime; we demonstrate this by exact numerical studies of distribution and bandwidth of the Floquet eigenstates, spectral form factor, entanglement entropy, and correlation functions of an experimentally realizable finite driven Rydberg chain. The corresponding micromotion exhibits coherent reversal of excitation reminiscent of echoes. Our analysis constitutes a yet unexplored mechanism for heating suppression in driven closed quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Slow relaxation of quasi-periodically driven integrable quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence and stability of a prethermal phase in an integrable many-body system subjected to a Fibonacci drive. Despite not being periodic, Fibonacci drives have been shown to introduce dynamical constraints due to their self-similar structure, unlike random driving protocols. From perturbative analysis, this has been argued to result in an exponentially long prethermal phase in the high frequency limit of driving. Examining higher order terms in the perturbative expansion, we show that the perturbative description breaks down eventually in such systems at a finite universal order, which depends solely on features of the Fibonacci sequence. This leads to an onset of energy absorption at long time scales for intermediate and low driving frequencies. Interestingly, in spite of the breakdown of an effective Hamiltonian in the perturbative analysis, we still observe slow logarithmic heating time-scales, unlike purely random drives.</description>

      <title>Solvable toy model of negative energetic elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have established negative energetic elasticity, the negative contribution of energy to the elastic modulus, as a universal property of polymer gels. To reveal the microscopic origin of this phenomenon, Shirai and Sakumichi investigated a polymer model on a cubic lattice with the energy effect from the solvent in finite-size calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023)]. Motivated by this work, we provide a simple platform to study the elasticity of polymer chains by considering a one-dimensional random walk with the energy effect. This model can be mapped onto the classical Ising chain, leading to an exact form of the free energy in the thermodynamic or continuous limit. Our analytical results are qualitatively consistent with Shirai and Sakumichi's work. Our model serves as a fundamental benchmark for studying negative energetic elasticity.</description>

      <title>Ordering kinetics with long-range interactions: interpolating between voter and Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ordering kinetics of a generalization of the voter model with long-range interactions, the $p$-voter model, in one dimension. It is defined in terms of boolean variables $S_{i}$, agents or spins, located on sites $i$ of a lattice, each of which takes in an elementary move the state of the majority of $p$ other agents at distances $r$ chosen with probability $P(r)\propto r^{-\alpha}$. For $p=2$ the model can be exactly mapped onto the case with $p=1$, which amounts to the voter model with long-range interactions decaying algebraically. For $3\le p&lt;\infty$, instead, the dynamics falls into the universality class of the one-dimensional Ising model with long-ranged coupling constant $J(r)=P(r)$ quenched to small finite temperatures. In the limit $p\to \infty$, a crossover to the (different) behavior of the long-range Ising model quenched to zero temperature is observed.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge $N$-vector models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase diagram and critical behaviors of three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge $N$-vector models, in which an $N$-component real field is minimally coupled with a ${\mathbb
  Z}_2$-gauge link variables. These models are invariant under global O($N$) and local ${\mathbb Z}_2$ transformations. They present three phases characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the global O($N$) symmetry and by the different topological properties of the ${\mathbb
  Z}_2$-gauge correlations. We address the nature of the three transition lines separating the three phases. The theoretical predictions are supported by numerical finite-size scaling analyses of Monte Carlo data for the $N=2$ model. In this case, continuous transitions can be observed along both transition lines where the spins order, in the regime of small and large inverse gauge coupling $K$. Even though these continuous transitions belong to the same $XY$ universality class, their critical modes turn out to be different. When the gauge variables are disordered (small $K$), the relevant order-parameter field is a gauge-invariant bilinear combination of the vector field. On the other hand, when the gauge variables are ordered (large $K$), the order-parameter field is the gauge-dependent $N$-vector field, whose critical behavior can only be probed by using a stochastic gauge fixing that reduces the gauge freedom.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions with correlations in configuration space: a Monte Carlo study on lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While phases and phase transitions are mostly characterized by order parameters or physical quantities in real space, we propose that the correlation in Hilbert space is closely connected to phase transitions. Specifically, this correlation is quantified by the 1-norm distance between configurations, and the distribution of distances can be obtained from a small fraction of configurations in the exponentially large Hilbert space, with the help of importance sampling procedures of the Monte Carlo method. Considering the obtained distances as a data set, its distribution varies substantially in different phases, and the numerical results further suggest a universal critical behavior for the uncertainty and participation entropy extracted from it. For various classical spin models with different types of phases and phase transitions, the finite-size analysis based on these quantities successfully catches the phase transitions with accurate critical points. Moreover, in all cases for different systems and phase transitions, the critical exponent from the uncertainty of the distances is found to numerically equal the anomalous dimension that determines the decay of the correlation in real space. This implies a deeper connection between the correlation in the real space and configuration space, which deserves further investigation. In our proposal, the definition of distance covers various lattice models with different local degrees of freedom, e.g., two levels for Ising-like models, discrete multi-levels for $q$-state clock models, and continuous local levels for the $XY$ model, and the way handling the distances is very simple and robust. Our proposal provides an alternative way of understanding the complex phases and phase transitions in complicated systems where the order parameter is hard to compute or define.</description>

      <title>Particle Scattering and Fusion for the Ablowitz-Ladik Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ablowitz-Ladik chain is an integrable discretized version of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We report on a novel underlying Hamiltonian particle system with properties similar to the ones known for the classical Toda chain and Calogero fluid with $1/\sinh^2$ pair interaction. Boundary conditions are imposed such that, both in the distant past and future, particles have a constant velocity. We establish the many-particle scattering for the Ablowitz-Ladik chain and obtain properties known for generic integrable many-body systems. For a specific choice of the chain, real initial data remain real in the course of time. Then, asymptotically, particles move in pairs with a velocity-dependent size and scattering shifts are governed by the fusion rule.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying numbers of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. This establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

      <title>Solvable models of two-level systems coupled to itinerant electrons: Robust non-Fermi liquid and quantum critical pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strange metal behavior is traditionally associated with an underlying putative quantum critical point at zero temperature. However, in many correlated metals, e.g., high-Tc cuprate superconductors, strange metallicity persists at low temperatures over an extended range of microscopic parameters, suggesting the existence of an underlying quantum critical phase, whose possible physical origins remain poorly understood. Systematic investigations of physical scenarios giving rise to such a critical, non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase are therefore crucial to better understand this puzzling behavior. In a previous work [Bashan et al. arXiv:2310.07768], we considered a solvable large-N model consisting of itinerant electrons coupled to local two-level systems (TLSs) via spatially random interactions, inspired by the possibility of emergent metallic glassiness due to frustrated competing orders, and found that the system hosts an NFL phase with tunable exponents at intermediate couplings. In this work, we expand our investigation to the following: (i) We study the extent to which this NFL phase is generic by considering various deformations of our theory, including coupling of electrons to multiple operators of the TLSs and arbitrarily directed TLS-fields. We find that the physical picture obtained in Bashan et al. qualitatively persist in a wide region of parameter space, showcasing the robustness of the NFL phase; (ii) We analyze the superconducting instability due to coupling of TLSs to electrons, and find a rich structure, including quantum critical pairing associated with the NFL phase and conventional BCS pairing in the weak and strong coupling limits; (iii) We elaborate on the analysis of Bashan et al., including single-particle, transport and thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction is central to the motion of active (self-propelled) objects, such as bacteria, animals or robots. While in a viscous fluid friction is typically described by Stokes' law, objects in contact with other solid bodies are often governed by more complex empirical friction laws. We study active dry particles subject to dry Coulomb friction force numerically and analytically. The interplay of friction and activity forces induces a rich behavior resulting in three distinct dynamical regimes. While for low activity levels, active Brownian motion is recovered, for large activity we observe a dynamical Stop &amp; Go regime continuously switching from diffusion and accelerated motion. For further activity values, we observe a super-mobile dynamical regime characterized by a fully accelerated motion which is described by an anomalous scaling of the diffusion coefficient with the activity. These findings cannot be observed with Stokes viscous forces typical of active swimmers but are central in dry active objects.</description>

      <title>Field-induced Peierls phase in $S=1$ Heisenberg spins coupled to quantum phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-Peierls transition occurs in a one-dimensional $S=1$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model with single-ion anisotropy, coupled to finite frequency bond phonons, in a magnetic field. Our results indicate that for the pure Heisenberg model, any Peierls transition is suppressed by quantum fluctuations of the phonon field. However, a novel magnetic field-induced Spin-Peierls phase is realized in the presence of strong single-ion anisotropy. Contrary to the standard Peierls state, the periodicity of bond strength modulation in this field-induced Spin-Peierls state is variable and depends on the strength of the applied field. The nature of the ground state in this new phase and the associated field-driven transitions to and out of this phase are explored using extensive numerical simulations. In particular, we explore the spin and bond correlations and the evolution of bond order modulation with varying magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystals in the presence of non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete time crystals (DTCs) in periodically driven quantum systems, in the presence of non-Markovian dissipation. In contrast to DTCs observed in earlier works in the presence of Markovian dynamics, using the open Dicke model in presence of Jaynes-Cummings-like dissipation, we show that non-Markovian regime can be highly beneficial for stabilizing DTCs over a wide range of parameter values. This may be attributed to periodically varying dissipation rates even at long times in the case of non-Markovian dynamics. Further the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes show sharp distinctions for intermediate strengths of the dissipator coefficient, with a time-independent steady-state in the Markovian regime being replaced by varied dynamical phases, including DTC order, in the non-Markovian regime. We also verify the robustness of the DTC phase in the non-Markovian regime by introducing errors both in the Hamiltonian as well as in the dissipation. Our study shows the possibility of using DTC as a probe for non-Markovian dynamics in periodically modulated open quantum systems, at long times.</description>

      <title>Multifractal phase in the weighted adjacency matrices of random Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix in the giant connected component of Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, with average connectivity $p$ and randomly distributed hopping amplitudes. By solving the self-consistent cavity equations satisfied by the matrix elements of the resolvent, we compute the probability distribution of the local density of states, which governs the scaling with the system size of the moments of the eigenvectors' amplitudes, as well as several other observables related to the spectral statistics. For small values of $p&gt;1$ above the percolation threshold, we unveil the presence of an exotic delocalized but (weakly) multifractal phase in a broad region of the parameter space, which separates the localized phase found for $p\le1$ from the fully-delocalized GOE-like phase expected for $p\to \infty$. We explore the fundamental physical mechanism underlying the emergence of delocalized multifractal states, rooted in the pronounced heterogeneity in the topology of the graph. This heterogeneity arises from the interplay between strong fluctuations in local degrees and hopping amplitudes, and leads to an effective fragmentation of the graph. We further support our findings by characterizing the level statistics and the two-point spatial correlations within the multifractal phase, and address the ensuing anomalous transport and relaxation properties affecting the quantum dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium microbial dynamics unveil a new macroecological pattern beyond Taylor's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive analytical benchmark, relying on Fokker-Planck formalism, to study microbial dynamics in presence of both biotic and abiotic forces. In equilibrium, we observe a balance between the two kinds of forces, leading to no correlations between species abundances. This implies that real microbiomes, where correlations have been observed, operate out of equilibrium. Therefore, we analyze non-equilibrium dynamics, presenting an ansatz for an approximate solution that embodies the complex interplay of forces in the system. This solution is consistent with Taylor's law as a coarse-grained approximation of the relation between species abundance and variance, but implies subtler effects, predicting unobserved structure beyond Taylor's law. Motivated by this theoretical prediction, we refine the analysis of existing metagenomic data, unveiling a novel universal macroecological pattern. Finally, we speculate on the physical origin of Taylor's law: building upon an analogy with Brownian motion theory, we propose that Taylor's law emerges as a Fluctuation-Growth relation resulting from equipartition of environmental resources among microbial species.</description>

Abstract: Applying an excess entropy scaling formalism to the coarse-grained (CG) dynamics of liquids, we discovered that missing rotational motions during the CG process are responsible for artificially accelerated CG dynamics. In the context of the dynamic representability between the fine-grained (FG) and CG dynamics, this work introduces the well-known Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations to unravel the rotational dynamics underlying FG trajectories, thereby allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effective rotations based only on the translational information at the reduced CG resolution. Since the representability issue in CG modeling limits a direct evaluation of the shear stress appearing in the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, we introduce a translational relaxation time as a proxy to employ these relations, and we demonstrate that these relations hold for the ambient conditions studied in our series of work. Additional theoretical links to our previous work are also established. First, we demonstrate that the effective hard sphere radius determined by the classical perturbation theory can approximate the complex hydrodynamic radius value reasonably well. Also, we present a simple derivation of an excess entropy scaling relationship for viscosity by estimating the elliptical integral of molecules. In turn, since the translational and rotational motions at the FG level are correlated to each other, we conclude that the "entropy-free" CG diffusion only depends on the shape of the reference molecule. Our results and analyses impart an alternative way of recovering the FG diffusion from the CG description by coupling the translational and rotational motions at the hydrodynamic level.</description>

      <title>Energy supply into a semi-infinite $\beta$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain by periodic force loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09441v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with dynamics of the~$\beta$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain with one free end, subjected to the sinusoidal periodic force. We examine evolution of the total energy, supplied at large times. In the harmonic case~($\beta=0$), the energy grows in time linearly at non-zero group velocities, corresponding to the excitation frequency and grows in time as~$\sqrt{t}$ at zero group velocity. Explanation of behavior in time of the energy is proposed by analysis of obtained approximate closed-form expression for the field of particle velocities.
  In the weak anharmonic case, large-time asymptotic approximation for the total energy is obtained by using the renormalized dispersion relation. Operating of the approximation, we analyze energy transfer at the driving frequencies, lying both in the pass-band and in the stop-band of the harmonic chain. Consistency of the asymptotic assesses with the results of numerical simulations is discussed.</description>

      <title>Finite-Size Scaling of the High-Dimensional Ising Model in the Loop Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides its original spin representation, the Ising model is known to have the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) bond and loop representations, of which the former was recently shown to exhibit two upper critical dimensions $(d_c=4,d_p=6)$. Using a lifted worm algorithm, we determine the critical coupling as $K_c = 0.077\,708\,91(4)$ for $d=7$, which significantly improves over the previous results, and then study critical geometric properties of the loop-Ising clusters on tori for spatial dimensions $d=5$ to 7. We show that, as the spin representation, the loop Ising model has only one upper critical dimension at $d_c=4$. However, sophisticated finite-size scaling (FSS) behaviors, like two length scales, two configuration sectors and two scaling windows, still exist as the interplay effect of the Gaussian fixed point and complete-graph asymptotics. Moreover, using the Loop-Cluster algorithm, we provide an intuitive understanding of the emergence of the percolation-like upper critical dimension $d_p=6$ in the FK-Ising model. As a consequence, a unified physical picture is established for the FSS behaviors in all the three representations of the Ising model above $d_c=4$.</description>

      <title>Ordering Kinetics of the two-dimensional voter model with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analytically the ordering kinetics of the two-dimensional long-range voter model on a two-dimensional lattice, where agents on each vertex take the opinion of others at distance $r$ with probability $P(r) \propto r^{-\al}$. The model is characterized by different regimes, as $\al$ is varied. For $\al &gt; 4$ the behaviour is similar to that of the nearest-neighbor model, with the formation of ordered domains of a typical size growing as $L(t) \propto \sqrt{t}$, until consensus is reached in a time or order $N\ln N$, $N$ being the number of agents. Dynamical scaling is violated due to an excess of interfacial sites whose density decays as slow as $\rho(t) \propto 1/\ln t$. Sizable finite-time corrections are also present, which are absent in the case of nearest-neighbors interactions. For $0&lt;\al \leq 4$ standard scaling is reinstated, and the correlation length increases algebraically as $L(t)\propto t^{1/z}$, with $1/z=2/\al$ for $3&lt;\al&lt;4$ and $1/z=2/3$ for $0&lt;\al&lt;3$. In addition, for $\al \le 3$, $L(t)$ depends on $N$ at any time $t&gt;0$. Such coarsening, however, only leads the system to a partially ordered metastable state where correlations decay algebraically with distance, and whose lifetime diverges in the $N\to \infty$ limit. In finite systems consensus is reached in a time of order $N$ for any $\al &lt;4$.</description>

      <title>From latent dynamics to meaningful representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While representation learning has been central to the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a key problem remains in making the learned representations meaningful. For this, the typical approach is to regularize the learned representation through prior probability distributions. However, such priors are usually unavailable or are ad hoc. To deal with this, recent efforts have shifted towards leveraging the insights from physical principles to guide the learning process. In this spirit, we propose a purely dynamics-constrained representation learning framework. Instead of relying on predefined probabilities, we restrict the latent representation to follow overdamped Langevin dynamics with a learnable transition density - a prior driven by statistical mechanics. We show this is a more natural constraint for representation learning in stochastic dynamical systems, with the crucial ability to uniquely identify the ground truth representation. We validate our framework for different systems including a real-world fluorescent DNA movie dataset. We show that our algorithm can uniquely identify orthogonal, isometric and meaningful latent representations.</description>

      <title>Separability transitions in topological states induced by local decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study states with intrinsic topological order subjected to local decoherence from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a decohered mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) pure states. We focus on toric codes and the X-cube fracton state and provide evidence for the existence of decoherence-induced separability transitions that precisely coincide with the threshold for the feasibility of active error correction. A key insight is that local decoherence acting on the 'parent' cluster states of these models results in a Gibbs state. As an example, for the 2d (3d) toric code subjected to bit-flip errors, we show that the decohered density matrix can be written as a convex sum of SRE states for $p &gt; p_c$, where $p_c$ is related to the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the 2d (3d) random-field bond Ising model along the Nishimori line.</description>

      <title>Field theory for mechanical criticality in disordered fiber networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strain-controlled criticality governs the elasticity of jamming and fiber networks. While the upper critical dimension of jamming is believed to be $d_u$=2, non mean-field exponents are observed in numerical studies of 2D and 3D fiber networks. The origins of this remains unclear. In this study we propose a minimal mean-field model for strain-controlled criticality of fiber networks. We then extend this to a phenomenological field theory, in which non mean-field behavior emerges as a result of the disorder in the network structure. We predict that the upper critical dimension for such systems is $d_u$=4 using a Gaussian approximation. Moreover, we identify an order parameter for the phase transition, which has been lacking for fiber networks to date.</description>

      <title>Probing pair correlations in Fermi gases with Ramsey-Bragg interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in one and two dimensions via recursion method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the recursion method that addresses quantum many-body dynamics in the nonperturbative regime. The method essentially amounts to constructing a Lanczos basis in the space of operators and solving coupled Heisenberg equations in this basis. The reported implementation has two key ingredients: a computer-algebraic routine for symbolic calculation of nested commutators and a procedure to extrapolate the sequence of Lanczos coefficients according to the universal operator growth hypothesis. We apply the method to calculate infinite-temperature correlation functions for spin-$1/2$ systems on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In two dimensions the accessible timescale is large enough to essentially embrace the relaxation to equilibrium. The method allows one to accurately calculate transport coefficients. As an illustration, we compute the diffusion constant for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>First Hitting Times on a Quantum Computer: Tracking vs. Local Monitoring, Topological Effects, and Dark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum walk on a ring represented by a directed triangle graph with complex edge weights and monitored at a constant rate until the quantum walker is detected. To this end, the first hitting time statistics is recorded using unitary dynamics interspersed stroboscopically by measurements, which is implemented on IBM quantum computers with a midcircuit readout option. Unlike classical hitting times, the statistical aspect of the problem depends on the way we construct the measured path, an effect that we quantify experimentally. First, we experimentally verify the theoretical prediction that the mean return time to a target state is quantized, with abrupt discontinuities found for specific sampling times and other control parameters, which has a well-known topological interpretation. Second, depending on the initial state, system parameters, and measurement protocol, the detection probability can be less than one or even zero, which is related to dark-state physics. Both, return-time quantization and the appearance of the dark states are related to degeneracies in the eigenvalues of the unitary time evolution operator. We conclude that, for the IBM quantum computer under study, the first hitting times of monitored quantum walks are resilient to noise. Yet, a finite number of measurements leads to broadening effects, which modify the topological quantization and chiral effects of the asymptotic theory with an infinite number of measurements. Our results point the way for the development of novel quantum walk algorithms that exploit measurement-induced effects on quantum computers.</description>
