      <title>AGFS-Tractometry: A Novel Atlas-Guided Fine-Scale Tractometry Approach for Enhanced Along-Tract Group Statistical Comparison Using Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations. There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale, along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments, AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and related code are available at: https://github.com/ZhengRuixi/AGFS-Tractometry.git.</description>

      <title>Strategic Control of Drug-Resistant HIV: Multi-Strain Modeling with Diagnosis, Adherence, and Treatment Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) public health policy lies in determining whether to universally expand treatment access, despite the risk of sub-optimal adherence and consequent drug resistance, or to adopt a more strategic allocation of resources that balances treatment coverage with adherence support. This dilemma is further complicated by the need for timely switching to second-line therapy, which is critical for managing treatment failure but imposes additional burdens on limited healthcare resources. In this study, we develop and analyze a compartmental model of HIV transmission that incorporates both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, diagnosis status, and treatment progression, including switching to second-line therapy upon detection of resistance. Basic reproduction numbers for both strains are derived, and equilibrium analysis reveals the existence of a disease-free state and two endemic states, where the drug-sensitive strain may be eliminated while the drug-resistant strain persists. Local and global sensitivity analyses are performed, using partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) and Sobol methods, to identify key parameters influencing different model outcomes. We extend the model using optimal control theory to assess multiple intervention strategies targeting diagnosis, treatment initiation, and adherence. A novel dynamic control framework is proposed to achieve the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets through efficient resource allocation. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and compare the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of control strategies. Our findings highlight that long-term HIV epidemic control depends critically on prioritizing adherence-focused interventions alongside efforts to expand first-line treatment coverage.</description>

      <title>A Simple Approximate Bayesian Inference Neural Surrogate for Stochastic Petri Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are an increasingly popular tool of choice for modeling discrete-event dynamics in areas such as epidemiology and systems biology, yet their parameter estimation remains challenging in general and in particular when transition rates depend on external covariates and explicit likelihoods are unavailable. We introduce a neural-surrogate (neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On synthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function coefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven, likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Antibody Kinetics Post Infection and Vaccination: A Markov Chain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level, and inform booster timing recommendations.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Biomarker Prospects of High-Altitude Diseases: Insights from Biomolecular Event Network Constructed using Text Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-altitude diseases (HAD), encompassing acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), are triggered by hypobaric hypoxia at elevations above 2,500 meters. These conditions pose significant health risks, yet the molecular mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we developed a biomolecular event extraction pipeline integrating supervised machine learning with feature-based and multiscale Laplacian graph kernels to analyze 7,847 curated HAD-related abstracts from PubMed. We extracted over 150 unique biomolecular events including gene expression, regulation, binding, and localization and constructed a weighted, undirected biomolecular event network comprising 97 nodes and 153 edges. Using the PageRank algorithm, we prioritized key biomolecules based on their centrality within the event network. The top-ranked proteins included Erythropoietin (EPO) (0.0163), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (0.0148), Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha (0.0136), Endothelial PAS Domain Protein 1 (EPAS1) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) (0.0119), Egl nine homolog 1 (EGLN1), Endothelin 1 (ET-1), and 70 kilodalton heat shock protein (Hsp70)(0.0118), all of which play crucial roles in oxygen sensing, vascular remodeling, erythropoiesis, and blood pressure regulation. Subnetwork analysis revealed three major functional clusters centered on hypoxia response, inflammation, and stress adaptation pathways. Our integrative approach demonstrates the utility of large-scale text mining and graph-based analysis to uncover mechanistic insights and prioritize potential biomarkers for high-altitude disease.</description>

      <title>Test-time Adaptation for Foundation Medical Segmentation Model without Parametric Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation medical segmentation models, with MedSAM being the most popular, have achieved promising performance across organs and lesions. However, MedSAM still suffers from compromised performance on specific lesions with intricate structures and appearance, as well as bounding box prompt-induced perturbations. Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical image segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization) or whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update signals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches ignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly significant for modern foundation models. To this end, our theoretical analyses reveal that directly refining image embeddings is feasible to approach the same goal as parametric updates under the MedSAM architecture, which enables us to realize high computational efficiency and segmentation performance without the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Under this framework, we propose to encourage maximizing factorized conditional probabilities of the posterior prediction probability using a proposed distribution-approximated latent conditional random field loss combined with an entropy minimization loss. Experiments show that we achieve about 3\% Dice score improvements across three datasets while reducing computational complexity by over 7 times.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Traits as Dynamical Systems: Utilizing Entropy to Analyze Longitudinal Psychometric Data in Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traits such as neuroticism persist across species despite exhibiting characteristics typically regarded as maladaptive. This paper introduces a systems-based framework for understanding trait-stability, integrating findings from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (SATSA) with a biologically grounded system of coupled ordinary differential equations. To enable dynamical modeling, Shannon entropy is extracted from longitudinal Likert-scale psychometric data, and is treated as a population-level signal of behavioral dispersion, reducing high-dimensional Likert data into low-dimensional trajectories. These trajectories serve as dynamical variables in the ODE framework, which is governed by principles from evolutionary biology, including mutation-selection balance, genetic pleiotropy, and metabolic constraints. The model is benchmarked against a null (uncoupled) system and additionally validated through multiple stress tests using RMSE, R^2, and dynamic time warping metrics. By embedding environmental feedback as a recursive driver of phenotypic expression, traits such as neuroticism are framed not as stochastic byproducts, but as emergent, multi-stable attractors within a biologically constrained system. The resulting Entropy-Coupled Trait ODEs (ECTO) reveal structured attractor dynamics and demonstrate that entropy functions not merely as a descriptive measure, but as a functional driver of behavioral evolution. This approach provides a scalable, mathematically grounded foundation for modeling phenotypic traits, with future applications to machine learning, multi-omic behavioral modeling, and related complex systems domains. By bridging psychometrics, evolutionary theory, and systems modeling, this work offers a general method for understanding long-term trait stability through recursive information-theoretic dynamics.</description>

      <title>A PBN-RL-XAI Framework for Discovering a "Hit-and-Run" Therapeutic Strategy in Melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ``hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>Nullstrap: A Simple, High-Power, and Fast Framework for FDR Control in Variable Selection for Diverse High-Dimensional Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Balancing false discovery rate (FDR) control with high statistical power remains a central challenge in high-dimensional variable selection. While several FDR-controlling methods have been proposed, many degrade the original data -- by adding knockoff variables or splitting the data -- which often leads to substantial power loss and hampers detection of true signals. We introduce Nullstrap, a novel framework that controls FDR without altering the original data. Nullstrap generates synthetic null data by fitting a null model under the global null hypothesis that no variables are important. It then applies the same estimation procedure in parallel to both the original and synthetic data. This parallel approach mirrors that of the classical likelihood ratio test, making Nullstrap its numerical analog. By adjusting the synthetic null coefficient estimates through a data-driven correction procedure, Nullstrap identifies important variables while controlling the FDR. We provide theoretical guarantees for asymptotic FDR control at any desired level and show that power converges to one in probability. Nullstrap is simple to implement and broadly applicable to high-dimensional linear models, generalized linear models, Cox models, and Gaussian graphical models. Simulations and real-data applications show that Nullstrap achieves robust FDR control and consistently outperforms leading methods in both power and efficiency.</description>
