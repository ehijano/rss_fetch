      <title>Sensitivity of grain-averaged elastic strain and orientation predictions on the mesh density and boundary conditions in crystal plasticity finite element simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combined high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) and crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) modeling studies have emerged as a preferred paradigm to shed insight into the evolution of elasticity and plasticity at the intragrain scale of polycrystals. In particular, far-field HEDM measures the deformation response of upwards of thousands of individual grains simultaneously in situ during mechanical loading, though measurements are primarily limited, however, to the average state of each grain -- i.e., the grain's full strain tensor, crystallographic orientation, spatial location and volume. CPFE is utilized to shed information on the intragrain deformation response, via the sub-discretization of each grain into many finite elements, though the direct point of comparison to HEDM remains the grain-averaged response. We thus seek to find the minimum simulation conditions necessary to provide consistent grain-averaged predictions in an attempt to limit computational cost. In this study, we perform a suite of simulations and systematically study the effects of mesh density and boundary conditions, and consider different materials. We discuss these results and show that accurate prediction of grain-averaged elastic strains in a given region of interest typically requires a mesh with 250 elements per grain on average and a buffer layer of at least three grains between the region of interest and the control surfaces.</description>

      <title>Impact of crystallinity on the circular and linear dichroism signals in chiral perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral perovskites owing to their broken mirror symmetry exhibit selective absorption of circularly polarized light manifesting a strong circular dichroism (CD). CD spectroscopy has been a key technique to understand chiral perovskites and how these semiconductors achieve chirality at the molecular level. However, there is a debate on whether the observed CD is intrinsic to the chiral crystal structures or is modulated by extrinsic phenomena particularly linear dichroism (LD) and linear birefringence (LB) effects. This work investigates the chiroptical properties of $(R-/S-\text{MBA})_2\mathrm{CuCl}_4$ (MBA = Methylbenzyl ammonium) series by thoroughly studying the contribution from LD and LB to the observed CD signals. The comparison of highly oriented and randomly oriented films exhibits notable LD and LB contributions to the observed CD, which are caused by orientation-dependent electric-field interactions and local anisotropy. Both randomly and highly oriented films exhibit distinct CD responses, with LD--LB effects largely dominating the CD in highly oriented films. This has been revealed by the obvious shift in the observed CD signals to the below-absorption-edge ($\sim 430$ nm) regime and broadening of features. Our findings demonstrate that careful consideration of crystal orientation and structural effects is necessary for appropriate interpretation of CD spectra in chiral perovskite thin films.</description>

      <title>Constitutive theory for mechanics of amorphous thermoplastic polymers under extreme dynamic loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometrically nonlinear continuum mechanical theory is formulated for deformation and failure behaviors of amorphous polymers. The model seeks to capture material response over a range of loading rates, temperatures, and stress states encompassing shock compression, inelasticity, melting, decomposition, and spallation. Thermoelasticity, viscoelasticity, viscoplasticity, ductile failure with localized shear yielding, and brittle fracture with crazing can all emerge under this ensemble of intense loading conditions. Known prior theories have considered one or more, but not all, such physical mechanisms. The present coherent formulation invokes thermodynamics with internal state variables for dynamic molecular and network configurational changes affecting viscoelasticity and plastic deformation, and it uses order parameters for more abrupt structural changes across state-dependent glass-transition and shock-decomposition thresholds. A phase-field order parameter captures material degradation from ductile or brittle fracture, including evolving porosity from crazing. The theory is applied toward polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under intense dynamic loading. The high-pressure equilibrium response, with shear strength and temperature over known ranges, is well represented along the principal Hugoniot to pressures far exceeding shock decomposition. Predicted release wave velocities agree with experiment. A semi-analytical solution for steady waves describes the relatively lower-pressure viscoelastic setting, providing insight into relaxation times. One-dimensional calculations assess suitability of the model for representing spall fracture strengths seen in experiments over a range of initial temperatures and loading rates.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost, Strong, and Ductile Single-Phase Nb-Based Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of structural materials capable of sustained operation above 1200 {\deg}C is critical for next-generation energy and aerospace systems; however, Ni-based superalloys are fundamentally constrained by their melting temperatures, while conventional Nb-based refractory alloys are limited by modest specific strength and high cost. Here, we report on the design and mechanical performance of a cost-effective, non-equiatomic refractory complex concentrated alloy (RCCA), Nb45Ta15Ti20V20, engineered to overcome these limitations. Specifically, its specific strength surpasses wrought C-103 and rivals additively manufactured (AM) C-103 at temperatures up to 1300 {\deg}C while maintaining extensive room temperature tensile ductility (&gt;10 %). Coupled with a high melting point (~2167 {\deg}C), reduced density (8.67 g/cc), and a raw material cost of ~$130/kg compared to &gt;$500/kg for wrought C-103 and &gt;$2,500/kg for AM C-103, this alloy delivers superior specific strength-cost efficiency, highlighting the promise of non-equiatomic RCCAs as viable alternatives to commercial refractory alloys.</description>

      <title>The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07295v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Band Gaps in Ensemble Density Functional Theory using Thermodynamic Limits of Finite One-Dimensional Model Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a promising extension to Density Functional Theory (DFT) for calculating excited states. While Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences underestimate gaps, EDFT has been shown to provide more accurate excitation energies in atoms, molecules and isolated model systems. However, it is unclear whether EDFT is capable of calculating band gaps of periodic systems -- and what an appropriate theoretical formulation would be to describe periodic systems. We explored how EDFT could calculate band gaps by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly wide finite versions of the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney (KP) periodic model. We use Octopus, an ab initio, open-source, real-space DFT code, as in our previous work [R. J. Leano et al., Electron. Struct. 6, 035003 (2024)] in which we found with "particle in a box" models that EDFT can provide a reasonable effective mass correction for the homogeneous electron gas. Now, we use a periodic reference that is gapped. We find that the finite systems' Kohn-Sham gap approaches the same periodic limit for each of three ways of terminating the finite system, though the appropriate states corresponding to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum have to be carefully identified in each case. Finally, our EDFT results, using a simple ensemblized LDA approximation, have a reasonable nonzero correction to the bandgap in the periodic limit. The results indicate that EDFT is promising for periodic systems, to motivate further work on developing a suitable formalism.</description>

      <title>Ordering Mixed-Q Topological Magnetism into Lattice via Moire Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnetic lattices offer a fertile ground for exploring fundamental physics and developing novel spintronic devices. However, current research is predominantly confined to single-Q topologies hosting uniform type of quasiparticle. The realization of exotic mixed-Q states, where distinct topological quasiparticles co-assemble into an ordered lattice, remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a generic mechanism to order disordered mixed-Q topological magnetism into periodic lattice via moire engineering. By leveraging the synergy between spatially modulated interlayer coupling and intrinsic intralayer magnetic frustration, we demonstrate that moire potential can effectively regularize skyrmions, antiskyrmions, and magnetic bubbles into a hybrid lattice. Combining first-principles with atomistic spin simulations, we validate this mechanism in twisted bilayer CrGaTe3, identifying it as an exemplary platform for hosting these complex ordered textures. We systematically map the phase evolution as a function of twist angle and biaxial strain, unveiling the critical role of moire potential in stabilizing mixed-Q lattice. Our findings significantly advance the frontier of topological and moire spintronics.</description>

      <title>AtomMOF: All-Atom Flow Matching for MOF-Adsorbate Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models have shown promise for modeling metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), but existing approaches (1) rely on coarse-grained representations that assume fixed bond lengths and angles, and (2) neglect the MOF-adsorbate interactions, which are critical for downstream applications. We introduce AtomMOF, a scalable flow-based model built on an all-atom Diffusion Transformer that maps 2D molecular graphs of building blocks and adsorbates directly to equilibrium 3D structures without imposing structural constraints. We further present scaling laws for porous crystal generation, indicating predictable performance gains with increased model capacity, and introduce Feynman-Kac steering guided by machine-learned interatomic potentials to improve geometric validity and sampling stability. On the (MOF-only) BW dataset, AtomMOF increases the match rate by 35.00% and reduces RMSD by 32.64%. On the ODAC25 dataset (MOF-adsorbate), AtomMOF is substantially more sample-efficient than grand canonical Monte Carlo in recovering adsorption configurations and can identify candidates with lower adsorption energies than the reference dataset.

      <title>ELAS3D-Xtal: An OpenMP-accelerated crystal elasticity solver with automated experiment-driven microstructure generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ELAS3D-Xtal, a high-performance Fortran/OpenMP upgrade of the NIST ELAS3D voxel-based finite element solver for computing 3D elastic fields in polycrystals with defects. The code supports crystal anisotropy by precomputing rotated stiffness tensors from user-specified orientations and solves the equilibrium problem with a matrix-free, OpenMP-parallel preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method using a point-block Jacobi preconditioner. On a single shared-memory multicore PC, OpenMP threading accelerates the baseline CG solver by ~10X, while the block-preconditioned CG solver achieves 53-61X speedup relative to the serial CG baseline for meshes from 100^3 to 500^3 voxels (scaling to domains up to 800^3 voxels). Accuracy is validated against the analytical Eshelby inclusion solution. ELAS3D-Xtal also integrates microstructure construction, including statistically calibrated polycrystal generation via spatial filtering and parallel voxel-to-grain assignment, direct pore insertion from XCT centroid/radius data, and texture assignment. Full-field phase, orientation, and stress outputs are written in HDF5 to enable scalable post-processing and defect-mechanics workflows. Applications are demonstrated for (i) anisotropy-controlled defect-scale stress fields and (ii) LPBF SS316L microstructures with gas, lack-of-fusion, and keyhole pore morphologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Robust p-type Transistor based on Ultra-wide-bandgap Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The p-type transistor is an indispensable component of semiconductor technology, enabling complementary operation with n-channel transistors for computation, storage, and communication. Achieving both high robustness and high efficiency is highly desirable but challenging for p-type transistors due to limited semiconductors with reliable hole transport and their high activation energies. Here, we achieved a robust yet efficient p-type transistor by heterogeneously integrating an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor and a high-k dielectric layer through van der Waals integration. The p-type transistor employs a two-dimensional hole channel on hydrogenated diamond (bandgap 5.6 eV) combined with a high-k (30.5) SrTiO3 perovskite membrane. At room temperature, the transistor exhibits stable operation with a high on-current (~200 mA/mm), low subthreshold swing (70 mV/dec), high hole mobility (566 cm^2/Vs to 572 cm^2/Vs) and high on-off ratio (~10^9). Furthermore, tuning annealing temperature allows operation in either enhancement or depletion mode. The robust p-type transistor with high efficiency holds great potential for future power electronics, UV optoelectronics, and harsh-environment electronic applications.</description>

      <title>First-principles study on the high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity of Mg-Ti-H ternary hydrides up to the liquid-nitrogen temperature range under high pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary hydrides have emerged as the primary focus of the new wave of research into superconducting hydrides. In this work, Mg-Ti-H ternary hydrides are explored under high pressures up to 300 GPa using the prediction method of the particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with first-principles calculations. Two new structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pmm2$-Mg$_3$TiH$_6$, are identified to be thermodynamically stable at both 200 GPa and 300 GPa. Thermodynamically stable structures of Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ are also identified, whose space groups are $R3/m$ at 200 GPa and $Pm\bar{3}m$ at 300 GPa, respectively. Among these Mg-Ti-H structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ achieves a record-high $T_\text{c}$ of 81.9 K at 170 GPa, exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Such a high $T_\text{c}$ is primarily attributed to strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) driven by low-frequency acoustic phonon modes, with the EPC strength reaching a large value of 1.54. The $T_\text{c}$ of $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ is predicted to be 40 K at 300 GPa. Furthermore, element substitution of Zr(Hf) for Ti achieves considerable enhancement of superconducting properties in our predicted hydrogen-rich and high-symmetric crystal structures, i.e., $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$. The high pressure required for dynamical stability is lowered to 100 GPa in both $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$ZrH$_{12}$ and $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$HfH$_{12}$, and to 90 GPa and 120 GPa for $P4/nmm$-MgZrH$_6$ and $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$, respectively. Particularly, the electronic structure near the Fermi level is significantly modified in the $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$ phase, and pronounced softening of low-frequency acoustic phonon modes occurs. As a result, the EPC strength is enhanced to 1.72, leading to a higher $T_\text{c}$ of 86 K.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Collective Higgs-Goldstone Dynamics in Solid-State Phononic Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of phononic frequency combs arising from nonlinear coupling between Higgs-like and Goldstone-like phonon modes in hexagonal InMnO3. The Higgs-like mode, an infrared-active optical phonon, is resonantly driven by a short, high-electric field terahertz pulse, while the optically inactive Goldstone-like mode is indirectly excited through intrinsic nonlinear mode coupling. Using a nonlinear phononics model, we numerically solve the coupled equations of motion governing the lattice dynamics and analyze the resulting time- and frequency-domain responses. By systematically varying key drive and material parameters-including electric field amplitude, pulse width, driving frequency, and mode damping-we identify the conditions under which stable phononic frequency combs emerge. Our results reveal clear threshold behaviors for comb formation, tunability of comb spacing and spectral bandwidth through external control parameters, and a breakdown of coherent comb structure at high drive strengths or weak damping. These findings demonstrate how nonlinear Higgs-Goldstone interactions enable controllable phononic frequency comb generation and provide insight into ultrafast lattice dynamics in symmetry-broken materials.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the plasmon-pole and multipole approximations in the Yambo Code using the GW100 dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verification and validation of electronic structure codes are essential to ensure reliable and reproducible results in computational materials science. While density functional theory has been extensively benchmarked, systematic assessments of many-body perturbation theory methods such as the GW approximation have only recently emerged, most notably through the GW100 dataset. In this work, we assess the numerical accuracy and convergence behavior of the GW implementation in the yambo code using both the Godby-Needs plasmon-pole model and the recently introduced multipole approximation. Quasiparticle energies are compared against GW100 reference data to evaluate the performance, numerical stability, and consistency of these approaches.</description>

      <title>Positron annihilation lifetime and Doppler broadening spectral calculations of oxygen-doped 3C-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on density functional theory (DFT), the formation energies of intrinsic vacancy defects (VC, VSi, and VSi+C) and oxygen-related defects (OC, OSi, OCVSi, and OSiVC) in 3C-SiC are systematically investigated. The results indicate that all defects considered, except for OC, possess neutral or negative charge states, thereby making them suitable for detection by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). Furthermore, the electron and positron density distributions and positron annihilation lifetimes for the perfect 3C-SiC supercell and various defective configurations are computed. It is found that the OSi and OSiVC complexes act as effective positron trapping centers, leading to the formation of positron trapped states and a notable increase in annihilation lifetimes at the corresponding defect sites. In addition, coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) spectra, along with the S and W parameters, are calculated for both intrinsic and oxygen-doped point defects (OC, OSi, OCVSi, and OSiVC). The analysis reveals that electron screening effects dominate the annihilation characteristics of the OSi defect, whereas positron localization induced by the vacancy is the predominant contributor in the case of OSiVC. This distinction results in clearly different momentum distributions of these two oxygen-related defects for different charge states. Overall, the PAS is demonstrated to be a powerful technique for distinguishing intrinsic vacancy-type defects and oxygen-doped composites in 3C-SiC. Combining the analysis of electron and positron density distributions, the electron localization and positron trapping behavior in defect systems with different charge states can be comprehensively understood. These first-principles results provide a solid theoretical foundation for identifying and characterizing the defects in oxygen-doped 3C-SiC by using PAS.</description>

Abstract: Thermal stability and phase transformation of conductive $\alpha$-$(\mathrm{Al}_{0.16}\mathrm{Ga}_{0.84})_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}/\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ heterostructures on sapphire substrates were investigated using in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Conductive $\alpha$-$(\mathrm{Al}_{0.16}\mathrm{Ga}_{0.84})_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}/\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ heterostructures with fluorine (F) doping were grown by mist chemical vapor deposition on sapphire substrates, achieving a Hall mobility of $28~\mathrm{cm^{2}\,V^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$ and an electron concentration of $1.4\times10^{20}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$.

      <title>Acoustic wave scattering by spatio-temporal interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time materials are obtained by modulating a physical medium with a traveling-wave perturbation of one or several of its constitutive parameters, such as the density or the bulk modulus in the case of acoustic materials. When this modulation has the form of a moving and abrupt (subwavelength) transition between two parameter values, we refer to a spatio-temporal interface, which may be considered as a building block for more complex space-time materials. This work considers the problem interaction and scattering of acoustic waves with a single spatio-temporal interface, and a sequence of two interfaces forming a slab. Several regimes defined by the relation between the sound propagation velocities and the interface velocity (namely subsonic, intersonic, and supersonic regimes) are discussed. Analytical expressions for the frequency conversions and scattering coefficients are obtained, and compared with numerical simulations based on an equivalent FTFD squeme.</description>

      <title>Sequential versus Manifold Bayesian Optimization under Realistic Experimental Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is widely used for autonomous materials discovery, yet its classical sequential formulation is insufficient for design of experimental workflows that often combine parallel or batch synthesis with inherently serial characterization. Methods such as combinatorial spread libraries and printed libraries sample a defined low-D manifold in the chemical space of the system. Here, we introduce a time-aware framework for comparing sequential and manifold BO under experimentally realistic constraints. By explicitly modeling synthesis and characterization times, we define an effective experimental time metric that enables fair, time-normalized benchmarking of optimization strategies. Using numerical experiments in ternary and quaternary compositional spaces, we show that sequential BO remains optimal for short-term experiments or when batching provides no effective time advantage, whereas manifold BO becomes favorable once multiplexed synthesis enables faster accumulation of measurements. We identify a small set of physically interpretable parameters that govern the transition between these regimes. These results establish a general, experimentally grounded framework for selecting optimization strategies in self-driving laboratories and autonomous materials discovery workflows. The accompanying analysis code is publicly available at https://github.com/Slautin/2025_GP_BO_Manifolds.</description>

      <title>Bernal Stacking and Symmetry-Inequivalent Antiferromagnetism in MSi$_2$N$_4$ Heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered MA$_2$Z$_4$ compounds, structural relatives of MoS$_2$ discovered in 2020, exhibit rich magnetic behavior arising from reduced dimensionality, noncentrosymmetric lattice symmetries, and stacking-dependent exchange interactions. Here, we investigate Bernal-like stackings in H-phase MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Mn and Fe; A = Si; Z = N) monolayers and bilayers by combining first-principles spin-dependent relaxation energies with a localized-spin Heisenberg description. From density-functional calculations, we extract the dominant intralayer exchange couplings up to third-nearest neighbors and the leading interlayer exchanges up to second-nearest neighbors, enabling construction of an effective bilayer spin Hamiltonian. We first analyze interface-driven proximity effects within a ferromagnetic reference configuration, demonstrating how recovery of AB-type stacking and spin alignment--while varying only the transition-metal species--provides a route for selectively tuning magnetic order and symmetry breaking within the P$\bar{6}$m2 space group. Building on this microscopic understanding of the bonding environment, we then examine antiferromagnetic ordering tendencies in the coupled layers. Exact diagonalization of the resulting bilayer Hamiltonian reveals the magnetic ground state and low-lying excitation spectrum, showing that the interlayer exchange is not merely perturbative but competes directly with intralayer interactions in stabilizing the observed spin configurations. These results establish Bernal-stacked MA$_2$Z$_4$ bilayers as a platform in which stacking geometry and exchange hierarchy jointly govern magnetic reconstruction, offering a controlled pathway toward domain selection and spin-texture engineering in low-dimensional van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Proton Quantum Effects on Electronic Excitation in Hydrogen-bonded Organic Solid: A First-Principles Green's Function Theory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear quantum effects of protons on electronic excitations in hydrogen-bonded organic materials remains underexplored. In theoretical studies, modeling excitons in these extended systems is particularly difficult because they tend to have a large exciton binding energy and sometimes exhibit charge transfer character. We demonstrate how first-principles Green's function theory combined with the nuclear-electronic orbital method enables us to examine the nature of excitons in a prototypical organic solid of eumelanin, for which the extensive hydrogen bonds have been proposed to facilitate the formation of delocalized excitons. We investigate how the quantization of protons impacts electronic excitations. We discuss the extent to which the resulting proton quantum effects can be described as being derived from structure and how they induce molecular-level anisotropy for the excitons in the organic solid.</description>

      <title>Influence of Elastic Oscillations on Nucleation in Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to establishing the mechanisms of elastic oscillation influence on nucleation processes in metal melts. The method of physical modeling with low-temperature metallic alloys (Wood and Rose) and transparent organic media (salol, camphene, diphenylamine) was used. It was established that vibration and ultrasound significantly reduce the supercooling required to initiate crystallization. The effectiveness of the influence significantly increases for samples with solid substrates. The hypotheses about the influence through changes in melt viscosity and the exclusive role of cavitation were experimentally refuted. The transition from pre-cavitation to cavitation ultrasound regime is not accompanied by qualitative changes in the influence on nucleation. The mechanism of elastic oscillation influence is substantiated, which consists in mechanical impact on adsorbed crystal nuclei on the surfaces of solid substrates. Elastic oscillations increase the nucleation rate by creating growth steps (dislocations) on the surfaces of adsorbed nuclei as a result of mechanical friction of solid substrates and cavitation erosion. The results have fundamental significance for understanding the physical nature of metal crystallization and practical application for developing technologies for controlling structure formation.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial lift-off of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membranes enabled by BaO sacrificial layers and restoration of the Curie temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin complex-oxide membranes provide a powerful platform for strain engineering, interfacial control, and heterogeneous integration; however, their formation remains constrained by the availability and performance of suitable water-soluble sacrificial layers. This letter demonstrates that barium oxide (BaO) serves as a highly efficient and rapidly dissolving water-soluble sacrificial layer, enabling the epitaxial lift-off and transfer of ultrathin La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) membranes onto SiO$_x$/Si substrates. LSMO membranes with a thickness of approximately 8 nm are released using a BaO sacrificial layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy, while high crystallinity is preserved and Ba interdiffusion is limited to a narrow interfacial region of approximately 0.5 nm. Post-transfer oxygen annealing at 600 ${}^\circ$C increases the Curie temperature ($T_C$) from 342 K to 346 K by eliminating Mn$^{2+}$ states associated with oxygen vacancies generated through oxygen extraction into the BaO layer. These results show that BaO provides a fast, scalable, and compositionally simple route for complex-oxide membrane release, while brief oxygen annealing is essential to restore the optimal Mn valence state and achieve the intrinsic high $T_C$.</description>

      <title>CDW Gap Collapse and Weyl State Restoration in (TaSe4)2I via Coherent Phonons: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent phonon excitation offers a nonthermal route to control quantum phases of condensed matter. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the phonon landscape of (TaSe4)2I in its charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. We identify nine symmetry-preserving Raman-active modes that can suppress the Gamma-Z direct gap to the meV scale and render the system globally gapless by generating Weyl nodes at generic k points. Among them, the 2.51 THz CDW amplitude mode A(18) directly weakens the Ta-chain tetramerization, approaching a transient restoration of the uniform-chain geometry. It is also the most efficient mode owing to its low frequency and a relatively small critical displacement dominated by Ta motions. Other Raman modes, dominated by Se vibrations, require significantly larger displacements to reach the Weyl-semimetallic regime and are generally less effective than A(18) at reducing the Ta-chain tetramerization. Furthermore, we explore nonlinear phonon-phonon interactions and find that the low-frequency infrared-active mode B3(7) (1.14 THz) exhibits strong anharmonic coupling with A(18), providing an indirect pathway to drive the system toward a Weyl-semimetallic regime. Our results provide predictive insight for ultrafast pump-probe experiments and present a generalizable framework for lattice-driven topological switching in quasi-one-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the impact of anti-site defects in magnetic transitions of few-layer MnBi2Te4 by operando heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the first experimentally discovered intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, MnBi2Te4 has attracted widespread attentions, providing a unique platform for the exploration of topological quantum phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator state. Despite the increasing number of potential factors affecting samples being identified, obtaining the high-quality device performance with desired topological quantum phases remains a challenge. In this work, by comparing the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) of crystals with different defect densities that are characterized by atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we demonstrate that anti-site defects play an essential role in achieving ideal magnetic states. By measuring RMCD hysteresis loops with operando heating, we find that MnBi2Te4 few-layer samples are highly susceptible to thermal impact, even at temperature as low as 45{\deg}C. The magnetic behavior of heating-treated samples is akin to that of samples fabricated into devices, revealing the thermal impact on devices as well. Starting from few-layers with ideal layer-dependent magnetic order, thermal heating leads to the convergence of magnetization and transition fields between odd- and even-layers. The observed heating-induced magnetic evolution can serve as a valuable reference for assessing the sample quality or the density of anti-site defects. Our findings not only point out the long-standing hidden factor that arose controversies in MnBi2Te4, but also pave the way for controllably engineering the topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Design principles for III-nitride-nanocluster photocatalysts from region-resolved electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how nanocluster cocatalysts modify the electronic structure of III-nitride surfaces is central to the rational design of efficient photocatalytic interfaces. Here, we establish design principles for nanocluster cocatalysts on GaN-based semiconductors by systematically analyzing the spatially resolved electronic structure of GaN-, InGaN-, and ScGaN-based slabs decorated with six-atom elemental nanoclusters. Using a region-resolved projected local density of states (PLDOS) framework, we reveal that semiconductor-nanocluster interfaces operate as laterally heterogeneous electronic systems, in which nanocluster-covered regions govern charge injection and band bending, while uncovered nitride regions retain surface states that facilitate surface activation. We further show that cocatalyst effectiveness is controlled not only by hydrogen adsorption energy, but also by interfacial electrostatics, including band alignment, metal-induced gap-state suppression, and in-plane dipoles, with the semiconductor substrate defining the baseline electronic regime. Machine-learning regression models trained on physically motivated global and region-specific descriptors quantify the relative importance of these mechanisms and their correlation with hydrogen adsorption energetics. Together, this work provides transferable design principles for nanocluster cocatalysts on III-nitrides and a generalizable first-principles framework for studying spatially heterogeneous semiconductor-nanocluster interfaces.</description>

      <title>Boosting high-current alkaline water electrolysis and carbon dioxide reduction with novel CuNiFe-based anodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to a green hydrogen economy demands robust, scalable, and sustainable anodes for alkaline water electrolysis operating at industrial current densities (&gt;1 A/cm2). However, achieving high activity and long-term stability under such conditions remains a formidable challenge with conventional catalysts. Here, we report a novel trimetallic CuNiFe anode fabricated through a rapid, single-step electrodeposition process at room temperature without organic additives. The catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low overpotential of &lt;270 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and operates stably for over 500 hours at 1 A cm(-2) in 30 wt% KOH. In a practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM-WE), the CuNiFe anode enables a current density of 2.5 A cm(-2) at only 2.5 V, with a voltage efficiency of 66.8%. Beyond water splitting, this anode also significantly enhances CO2 electrolysis, tripling the CO2 reduction current density and steering selectivity toward valuable multi-carbon products when paired with commercial copper cathodes. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment confirms that the CuNiFe anode reduces the carbon footprint by an order of magnitude and decreases environmental impacts by 40-60% across multiple categories compared to benchmark IrRuO2. Our work establishes a scalable, high-performance, and environmentally benign anode technology, paving the way for cost-effective electrochemical production of green hydrogen and carbon-neutral chemicals.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Growth of Anisotropic SnSe on GaAs(001) via Step-Edge Orientation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial growth of orthorhombic SnSe on cubic substrates is challenging due to lattice-symmetry mismatch and anisotropic bonding. Here we demonstrate that epitaxial films with sharp interfaces can be achieved for layered SnSe grown directly on on-axis and 4 degree miscut GaAs(001) substrates. The substrate miscut strongly influences the growth morphology, evolving from spirals on on-axis GaAs to a terraced structure on miscut GaAs. X-ray diffraction reveals that on-axis GaAs supports SnSe with two in-plane orientation variants, whereas the miscut substrate stabilizes a single orientation and introduces a small out-of-plane tilt. Accordingly, in-plane optical anisotropy is enhanced in the single variant film compared to the double variant, as determined by cross-polar reflectance. High-resolution TEM shows that the SnSe/GaAs interface is atomically abrupt and incoherent, characteristic of quasi-van der Waals epitaxy. We find a pronounced tendency for the zigzag edges of SnSe to align parallel to step edges on both substrates, and we show that step-skipping nucleation and layer growth on the miscut substrate leads to the additional tilt. These results establish direct SnSe/GaAs heteroepitaxy as a route to integrate anisotropic layered semiconductors with cubic platforms, and show that miscut substrates provide additional control over in-plane anisotropy.</description>

Abstract: 2D van der Waals ferroelectrics, particularly alpha-In2Se3, have emerged as an attractive building block for next-generation information storage technologies due to their moderate band gap and robust ferroelectricity stabilized by dipole locking. alpha-In2Se3 can adopt either the distorted zincblende or wurtzite structures; however, the wurtzite phase has yet to be experimental-ly validated, and its large-scale synthesis poses significant challenges. Here, we report an in-situ transport growth of centimeter-scale wurtzite type alpha-In2Se3 films directly on SiO2 substrates using a process combining pulsed laser deposition and chemical vapor deposition. We demonstrate that it is a narrow bandgap ferroelectric semiconductor, featuring a Curie tem-perature exceeding 620 K, a tunable bandgap (0.8-1.6 eV) modulated by charged domain walls, and a large optical absorption coefficient of 1.3 times 10 powers 6 per centemeter. Moreover, light absorption promotes the dynamic conductance range, linearity, and symmetry of the synapse devices, leading to a high recognition accuracy of 92.3 percent in a supervised pattern classification task for neuromorphic computing. Our findings demonstrate a ferroelectric polymorphism of In2Se3, highlighting its potential in ferroelectric synapses for neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Ozonation of Dielectric Fosters Self-Healing Efficiency in Metalized-Film Capacitors: Quantum-Chemical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metalized-film capacitors (MFCs) employ polymer organic dielectrics like polypropylene (PP) and polyimide (PI), in which self-healing is seen as a key advantage. However, the performance of self-healing depends on specific chemical mechanisms involved. The formation of semiconductive carbonaceous soot represents a critical failure risk. This study investigates how oxygen atom impregnation through ozonation of the dielectric material tunes the composition and electrical conductivity of breakdown products in the PP and PI systems with aluminum-zinc electrodes. We revealed, at the atomistic level, that oxygen atoms tend to remove a fraction of carbon atoms from the semiconductive soot by oxidizing carbon into carbon monoxide in both polymers. In PP, oxygen fraction linearly increases gas mass fraction, thereby reducing soot fraction. In PI, the gas/soot ratio effect of oxygen content is less drastic, still clearly positive. The PP soot conductivity decreases uniformly as larger fractions of oxygen atoms are added. In turn, the PI conductivity drops to ~1500 S/m quickly. The PI soot exhibits narrower band gaps compared to that of PP. The oxygen fraction non-monotonically tailors band gaps, which generally increase. To summarize, ozonation enhances MFC reliability by increasing gas species fraction and reducing soot conductivity. We hereby provide numerical molecular-level insights to rationalize self-healing performance enhancement through polymer ozonation.</description>

      <title>Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in a High-Spin Shastry-Sutherland Dipolar Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shastry-Sutherland lattice is a prototypical frustrated quantum magnet. It is notable for its exactly solvable dimer-singlet ground state and hosts a wealth of magnetic phenomena under external fields. Here, this work investigates the high-spin (S = 7/2) Eu-based magnet Eu2MgSi2O7 (EMSO) using low-temperature magnetothermal measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, revealing a giant magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in this Shastry-Sutherland compound. The entropy change peak value is found to be 55.0 J kg-1 K-1 under a field change of B = 0-4 T, approximately 1.5 times larger than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG). Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration achieves a lowest temperature of 151 mK, deeply into the sub-Kelvin regime. Furthermore, a distinctive cooling effect persists below about 1 T, a characteristic absent for conventional magnetic coolants. A dipolar Shastry-Sutherland model is introduced as a minimal model to describe this system; in particular, the experimentally revealed 1/3 magnetization pseudo-plateau can be ascribed to the presence of dipolar couplings between Eu2+ ions, further stabilized by the thermal fluctuations, explaining the persistent cooling effect. This work establishes EMSO as a novel platform for exploring the dipolar Shastry-Sutherland system and for sub-Kelvin adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Inverse orbital Hall effect induced terahertz emission enabled by a ferromagnet with quenched orbital moment in Fe/Pt/W trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) has recently attracted considerable attention as an emerging mechanism for terahertz (THz) emission based on ultrafast angular-momentum-to-charge conversion. Most experimental studies have focused on materials with strong spin-orbit coupling or pronounced orbital character, where sizable orbital Hall responses are expected. Elemental ferromagnets such as Fe are generally regarded as quenched orbital sources and are not expected to exhibit orbital-dominated THz emission. Here, we report a pronounced enhancement of THz emission in Fe/Pt/W trilayer heterostructures, despite the absence of detectable orbital contributions in the corresponding Fe/Pt and Fe/W bilayers. Thickness-dependent measurements reveal long-distance signal persistence, systematic delay accumulation, and pronounced pulse broadening with increasing W thickness. These features are inconsistent with diffusive spin transport and indicate that orbital angular momentum transport in the W layer, converted into charge current via the IOHE, becomes a dominant channel for THz emission in the trilayer configuration. Our results demonstrate that strong IOHE can emerge in heterostructures incorporating a quenched orbital ferromagnet, providing an effective route to enhance spintronic THz emitters through orbital Hall physics.</description>

      <title>Coupling between CaWO$_4$ phonons and Er$^{3+}$ dopants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the lattice dynamics of CaWO$_4$, a promising host crystal for erbium-based quantum memories, using inelastic neutron scattering together with density-functional perturbation theory. The measured phonon dispersion along the (100), (001), and (101) reciprocal space direction reveals phonon bands extending up to 130 meV, with a gap between 60 and 80 meV, in good agreement with our calculations. From a symmetry analysis of the phonon eigenmodes, we identify eight Raman-active modes that can couple directly to the Er$^{3+}$ crystal-field operators, including a low-energy $B_g$ mode at 9.1 meV that is expected to play a dominant role in phonon-assisted spin-lattice relaxation. These results provide a microscopic description of the phonon bath in CaWO$_4$ and establish a basis for engineering phononic environments to mitigate the loss of stored quantum states and optimize Er-doped CaWO$_4$ for quantum-memory applications.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced electronic band evolution and observation of superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal ZrTe5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the pressure effects on the magnetotransport properties of the topological material ZrTe5 within 1 to 8 GPa pressure range. With increasing pressure, the characteristic peak (Tp) in its electrical resistivity first shifts to higher temperature and then moves quickly towards the lower temperature before disappearing eventually at 6 GPa. Beyond 6 GPa, the system exhibits metallic behavior across the entire temperature range, and superconductivity emerges below Tc = 1.8 K at 8 GPa. Based on the systematic magnetotransport measurement under pressure, we demonstrate that the superconductivity occurs following a significant electronic structure modulation possibly due to pressure induced structural changes near 6 GPa, which coincides with dramatic enhancement of the magnetoresistance (MR) reaching up to 1400 percent. Our experimental results are substantiated by density functional theory calculations as the application of pressure drastically alters the density of states near the Fermi level. Notably, multiple hole pockets emerge at the Fermi level from 4 GPa onward, and their contributions are further enhanced with increasing pressure. The combined experimental and theoretical investigation reveals a comprehensive evolution of electronic structure of Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 under pressure and suggest a possible link between the Fermi surface reconstruction in the pressure range of structural transition and emergence of superconductivity</description>

      <title>Hidden in-plane long-range order in an amorphized crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid materials are commonly classified as crystalline or amorphous based on the presence or absence of long-range order.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), like other solids,also display markedly different properties and functions in these two phases. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized structural state that retains long-range in-plane translational order while losing order along the stacking direction. Hypothesized since 1941 but not experimentally verified, this intermediate phase emerges in a crystalline MOFs via controlled thermal desolvation, which selectively disrupts the intrinsically weak interlayer interactions while preserving macroscopic structural coherence. Although the resulting material appears amorphous under conventional characterization, systematic synchrotron PXRD, total X-ray scattering, and low-dose high resolution TEM reveal clear in-plane periodicity. This material spontaneously delaminates in water into uniform, high-quality two-dimensional crystalline nanosheets, forming stable colloidal suspensions and exhibiting superlubricity comparable to graphene - but at less than 0.1% of the production cost. Our discovery finds a missing link within the long-standing crystalline-amorphous dichotomy, while providing an inherently scalable route to high-quality 2D crystals, and offering a conceptual and practical advance in phase engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta-Ti bcc-superalloys, comprising an A2 beta-Ti matrix reinforced by ordered intermetallic B2 beta-prime-TiFe precipitates, exhibit an unusual recrystallisation that occurs with no externally applied strain (i.e. no thermomechanical processing). Thermal ageing at 750 degrees Celsius for 72 h results in refinement of the grain size from 364 um to 30 um. This grain refinement is driven by discontinuous precipitation of beta-prime-TiFe lamellae with the beta-Ti matrix from grain/phase boundaries, which is associated with significant misorientation and increased dislocation density, attributed as precipitation induced recrystallisation (PIX).</description>

      <title>Phase behavior and electrical transport in DBTTF-HATCN donor-acceptor mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of donor-acceptor complexes (DACs) between the electron donor Dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and the acceptor Hexaaza\-triphenylene\-hexacarbo\-nitrile (HATCN) results in a new phase with a distinctly different crystal structure as well as new optical absorption bands below the energy gaps of the two pristine materials. X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy provide detailed insights into the film structure and morphology by systematic variation of the mixing ratio from pristine DBTTF to pristine HATCN. The measured electrical conductivity of thin films depends in a highly non-monotonic manner on the composition of the mixture and shows significantly improved charge transport compared to the pristine films. The temperature-dependent conductivity, charge carrier concentration, and mobility were investigated across these compositions. Surprisingly, all compositions exhibited n-type behavior, except for pristine DBTTF. This behavior is explained by the electronic structure of the mixtures, as revealed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicates that charge injection and transport occur via the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the DAC and HATCN. Additionally, the observed electrical conductivity is strongly influenced by morphology and structural ordering of the films. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of advanced materials with enhanced electrical performance.</description>

      <title>Synergistic cross-modal learning for experimental NMR-based structure elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, natural product characterization, and metabolomics, yet its interpretation remains heavily dependent on expert knowledge and difficult to scale. Although machine learning has been applied to NMR spectrum prediction, library retrieval, and structure generation, these tasks have evolved in isolation using simulated data and incompatible spectral representations, limiting their utility under real experimental scenarios.Here we present NMRPeak, a unified cross-modal learning system that integrates these three tasks through experimentally grounded design. We curate approximately 1.8 million experimental and simulated spectra to construct the largest benchmark for NMR-based structure elucidation and systematically quantify the distribution shift between these domains. We introduce a chemically-aware adaptive tokenizer that dynamically balances discretization granularity to preserve spectral semantics while controlling vocabulary size, and an assignment-free peak-aware similarity metric that enables direct comparison between predicted and experimental spectra. Through a unified molecule-to-spectrum paradigm and synergistic coupling of prediction, retrieval, and generation modules, NMRPeak achieves transformative performance on experimental benchmarks: it overcomes the longstanding simulation-to-experiment gap in spectrum prediction while delivering over 95% top-1 accuracy in molecular retrieval and approximately 75% top-1 accuracy in stereochemistry-aware de novo structure generation. These capabilities establish a foundation for automated, high-throughput molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, and chemical biology.</description>

      <title>Emergent altermagnetism at surfaces of antiferromagnets: full symmetry classification and material identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of altermagnetism at the surfaces of antiferromagnets, vastly expanding the number of material candidates with altermagnetic characteristics and establishing a route to two-dimensional altermagnetism through surface-induced symmetry breaking. We do so by developing a surface spin group formalism that fully classifies all surface magnetic states and identifies altermagnetic surface spin groups that can arise at the surfaces of antiferromagnets. We use this formalism to identify over 140 antiferromagnetic entries from the MAGNDATA database with at least one altermagnetic surface, often times with multiple such surfaces in the same material. We illustrate this emergent phenomenon in a realistic Lieb lattice-based minimal model and present ab initio calculations on two representative material candidates, NaMnP and FeGe$_2$, exhibiting $d$-wave and $g$-wave surface altermagnetism, respectively. Our theory naturally resolves the contradiction of recent experimental reports of $d$-wave ARPES measurements on metallic Lieb lattice compounds that have been shown to be antiferromagnetic in the bulk. Hence, we establish a new paradigm for generating two-dimensional altermagnetism by functionalizing the abundant material class of collinear antiferromagnets as viable platforms for controlled surface altermagnetism, creating natural materials for future hybrid device implementation.</description>

      <title>$d$-Wave Surface Altermagnetism in Centrosymmetric Collinear Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broken inversion symmetry at the surfaces of centrosymmetric collinear antiferromagnets lifts the combined inversion and time-reversal symmetry ($PT$) and can generate nonrelativistic d-wave spin splitting, termed surface altermagnetism. Combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we show that surface inversion breaking, while necessary, is not sufficient for this effect. Surface altermagnetism emerges only when the surface termination simultaneously breaks both $PT$ and translation--time-reversal symmetry ($tT$), thereby inducing magnetic sublattice inequivalence between antiferromagnetically coupled surface moments. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly for the G-type antiferromagnets V$_3$Al and BaMn$_2$Sb$_2$, and show that the same symmetry criterion applies broadly across distinct structural families of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets. These results establish a general, symmetry-based route to realizing robust, exchange-driven spin polarization at antiferromagnetic surfaces and interfaces.</description>

      <title>Flash annealing-engineered wafer-scale relaxor antiferroelectrics for enhanced energy storage performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric capacitors are essential for energy storage systems due to their high-power density and fast operation speed. However, optimizing energy storage density with concurrent thermal stability remains a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a flash annealing process with ultrafast heating and cooling rates of 1000 oC/s, which facilitates the rapid crystallization of PbZrO3 film within a mere second, while locking its high-temperature microstructure to room temperature. This produces compact films with sub-grain boundaries fraction of 36%, nanodomains of several nanometers, and negligible lead volatilization. These contribute to relaxor antiferroelectric film with a high breakdown strength (4800 kV/cm) and large polarization (70 uC/cm2). Consequently, we have achieved a high energy storage density of 63.5 J/cm3 and outstanding thermal stability with performance degradation less than 3% up to 250 oC. Our approach is extendable to ferroelectrics like Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and on wafer scale, providing on-chip nonlinear dielectric energy storage solutions with industrial scalability.</description>

      <title>The role of absorption in three-dimensional electron diffraction dynamical structure refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of absorption in 3D electron diffraction is established through analytical theory, simulation, and dynamical refinement. A two-beam expression for the absorbed integrated intensity is derived, showing that for $t/\xi_g \ll 1$ reflections follow a uniform exponential decay set by the mean absorptive potential $U_0'$. Many-beam simulations demonstrate that neglecting absorption in dynamical refinement of integrated intensities incurs a residual that increases linearly with thickness and diverges near zone axes. Dynamical refinements were performed on CsPbBr$_3$, quartz, and borane, with the inclusion of absorption yielding an improvement in $R_{\mathrm{obs}}$ from $6.4$ to $5.3$ \% for CsPbBr$_3$ and negligible changes for quartz and borane. Absorption is therefore deemed negligible for routine refinement of integrated intensities except in high-$Z$ materials at thicknesses approaching $\xi_g$.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Ultrathin Magnetic Multilayers at Terraced Topologically Insulating Interfaces for Perpendicularly Magnetized Domains</title>

Abstract: Topological insulators and skyrmion-hosting, chiral magnetic multilayers are two well-explored areas of modern condensed matter physics, each offering unique advantages for spintronics applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the optimization process for the growth of a Bi$_2$Se$_3$/buffer/[Pt/CoB/Ru]$_{\times N}$ heterostructure that combines these two material classes: the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ epilayer was grown by molecular beam epitaxy before transfer under ultrahigh vacuum to a separate growth chamber where the polycrystalline metallic multilayer was sputter deposited. The structure of the samples was characterized by co-fitted X-ray and polarized neutron reflectometry measurements and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Polarized neutron models and standard magnetometry show that a buffer layer exceeding a critical thickness is required to obtain the desired uniform, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in every magnetic layer in the multilayer. Samples with both Ta and Mo buffers were used requiring thicknesses of 1.5 and 0.9 nm respectively. In minimizing the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ terracing, buffered samples yield well-defined, out-of-plane, magnetic domains suitable for spin-orbit torque induced manipulation as determined by X-ray photoemission electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>DISCOVER: A Physics-Informed, GPU-Accelerated Symbolic Regression Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) enables the discovery of interpretable mathematical relationships from experimental and simulation data. These relationships are often coined descriptors which are defined as a fundamental materials property that is directly correlated to a desired or undesired functional property of the material. Although established approaches such as Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) have successfully identified low-dimensional descriptors within large feature spaces many existing SR tools integrate poorly with modern Python workflows, offer limited control over the symbolic search space, or struggle with the computational demands of large-scale studies. This paper introduces DISCOVER (Data-Informed Symbolic Combination of Operators for Variable Equation Regression), an open-source symbolic regression package developed to address these challenges through a modular, physics-motivated design. DISCOVER allows users to guide the symbolic search using domain knowledge, constrain the feature space explicitly, and take advantage of optional GPU acceleration to improve computational efficiency in data-intensive workflows, enabling reproducible and scalable SR workflows. The software is intended for applications in computational physics, computational chemistry, and materials science, where interpretability, physical consistency, and execution time are especially important, and it complements general-purpose SR frameworks by emphasizing the discovery of physically meaningful models.</description>

      <title>diffpy.morph: Python tools for model independent comparisons between sets of 1D functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06987v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy$.$morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy$.$morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Mechanical Response of 3D-Printed Diamondiynes: From Movable Interlocked Lattices to Architected Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamondynes are a recently synthesized three-dimensional carbon allotrope, with interlocked and movable sublattices that introduce deformation modes not present in standard architected materials. Here, we report the first multiscale mechanical assessment of Diamondiyne-derived architectures by combining quasi-static compression of 3D-printed specimens with reactive molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding atomic-scale models. We generate four geometries (3F, 2F-SY, 4F, and 2F-USY). All structures resulted in lower density in the range of 0.20-0.38 g.cm^-3. Experiments indicate that the symmetric two-sublattice structure (2F-SY) delivers the best performance, reaching a specific yield strength of 5.91 MPa.g^-1cm^-3 and a specific energy absorption of 279 J.g^-1, whereas 2F-USY architecture yielded the lowest values, with 0.77 MPa.g^-1.cm^-3 and 16 J.g^-1. The 4F geometry provided a specific energy absorption of 254 J.g^-1. The structures deformed through geometric collapse and strut buckling, which was due to diagonal shear in 2F-USY and progressive compaction in 2F-SY and 3F. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed these experimental trends and revealed strong directional anisotropy due to the arrangement of interlocked sublattices, with a stiffness of 24.1 GPa along the z-direction in the case of 4F architecture. Overall, Diamondiyne-derived architectures display geometry-dominated mechanical behavior and serve as a promising platform for lightweight, energy-absorbing metamaterials.</description>

      <title>MolLIBRA: Genetic Molecular Optimization with Multi-Fingerprint Surrogates and Text-Molecule Aligned Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sample-efficient molecular optimization under a limited budget of oracle evaluations. We propose MolLIBRA (MultimOdaLity and Language Integrated Bayesian and evolutionaRy optimizAtion), a genetic algorithm based framework that pre-ranks candidate molecules using multiple critics before oracle calls: (i) an ensemble of Gaussian process (GP) surrogates defined over multiple molecular fingerprints and (ii) a pretrained text-molecule aligned encoder CLAMP. The GP ensemble enables adaptive selection of task-appropriate fingerprints, while CLAMP provides a zero-shot scoring signal from task descriptions by measuring the similarity between molecular and text embeddings. On the Practical Molecular Optimization (PMO) benchmark with a budget of 1,000 evaluations (PMO-1K), MolLIBRA-L, our variant with a language-model-based candidate generator, attains the best Top-10 AUC on 14/22 tasks and the highest overall sum of Top-10 AUC across tasks among prior methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical transmission spectra of YAl3(BO3)4 crystals doped with the Pr3+ ions in concentrations 1 and 2.5 at. % were studied by high-resolution (up to 0.05 cm-1) Fourier spectroscopy, including in magnetic field parallel to the trigonal c axis of the crystal. The g factors of several crystal-field doublets of Pr3+ were determined. The crystal-field calculations performed using the exchange-charge model and high-resolution spectroscopy data allowed us to obtain a physically reasonable set of crystal-field parameters. The observed splitting of a number of doublets in zero magnetic field is explained by the presence of random lattice deformations. Simulation of the profiles of observed deformational doublets was carried out taking into account both hyperfine and electron-deformation interactions. The width of the distribution function of random strains was estimated. The main sources of random strains in YAl3(BO3)4:Pr3+ crystals are discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of Rashba coupling from first principles: Layer-resolved orbital asymmetry in transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional materials gives rise to a Rashba spin splitting when inversion and mirror symmetries are broken, yet its microscopic origin and quantitative characterization in transition metal dichalcogenides remains incomplete. Both symmetries are broken in certain bilayer structures, enabling Rashba splittings in the absence of external electric fields. We determine this zero-field offset and the Rashba parameters that dictate the spin splitting in the linear regime. Surprisingly, the splitting is substantially smaller in bilayers than in monolayers at typical fields. This is clarified within a perturbative microscopic model, revealing that the spin splitting results from a competition between internal polarization and interlayer hybridization. We further introduce the orbital polarization imbalance as an order parameter that captures the asymmetry of the valence bands and determines the spin ordering of the Rashba-split states. Our results are both quantitative and qualitative, as they clarify the nature and origin of Rashba coupling in transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Event-Chain Monte Carlo: The global-balance breakthrough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal 2009 paper by Bernard, Krauth, and Wilson marked a paradigm shift in Monte Carlo sampling. By abandoning the restrictive condition of detailed balance in favor of the more fundamental principle of global balance, they introduced the Event-Chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) algorithm, which achieves rejection-free, deterministic sampling for hard spheres. This breakthrough demonstrated that persistent, directional dynamics could dramatically accelerate equilibration in dense particle systems. In this commentary, we review this foundational work and elucidate its underlying mechanism using the broader Event-Driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) framework developed in subsequent years. We show how the original hard-sphere concept naturally generalizes to continuous potentials and modern lifted Markov chain formalisms, transforming a surprising specific result into a powerful general class of sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput In-Situ Fabrication of Fibrous Membranes Enables Scalable Passive Radiative Cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying fibrous membranes for passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) on large and irregular surfaces is highly desirable but remains challenging, owing to the slow deposition rates and the need for electrically conductive substrates in conventional electrospinning. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput in-situ strategy for fabricating nanocomposite PDRC fibrous membranes via solution blow spinning. This method achieves deposition rates 8-12 times faster than electrospinning and can be applied directly onto nonplanar, nonconductive objects. The resulting membranes, composed of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) fibers embedded with Y2O3 nanoparticles, achieve sub-ambient cooling of up to 7.0 {\deg}C outdoors, effectively delaying ice melting. Moreover, they are fully recyclable through simple cleaning, dissolution, and reprocessing. This scalable and sustainable fabrication route provides a versatile and practical platform for integrating PDRC fibrous membranes across diverse surfaces, paving the way toward real-world thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Complete electronic phase diagram and enhanced superconductivity in fluorine-doped PrFeAsO1-xFx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing a complete electronic phase diagram for REFeAsO (RE = rare earth, RE1111) ironbased superconductors has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we report a systematic investigation of PrFeAsO1-xFx over the full nominal fluorine-doping range 0 to 1 and construct the first comprehensive electronic phase diagram for this system. The evolution from the nonsuperconducting parent compound to the fluorine-rich limit reveals a broad dome shaped superconducting region. Structural refinement demonstrates a systematic lattice contraction with increasing fluorine content (x), corroborated by Raman spectroscopy through softening of the Pr(A1g) phonon mode and hardening of the Fe(B1g) mode, confirming effective fluorine incorporation at the oxygen sites. The maximum superconducting transition temperature (Tc) reaches up to 52.3 K, approximately 5 K higher than previous reports for Pr1111. Magnetotransport measurements yield large upper critical fields Hc2(0) exceeding 100 T, while analysis of resistive transition broadening reveals thermally activated flux flow with a crossover from single-vortex to collective pinning regimes. Specific-heat measurements exhibit a reduced jump deltaC/{\gamma}Tc &lt; 1.43, reflecting strong superconducting fluctuations and multiband pairing. These results establish clear structure property correlations and provide a unified description of superconductivity across the entire doping range of the Pr1111 system.</description>

      <title>GraphAgents: Knowledge Graph-Guided Agentic AI for Cross-Domain Materials Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.</description>

      <title>MSP-LLM: A Unified Large Language Model Framework for Complete Material Synthesis Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07543v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Turning non-superconducting elements into superconductors by quantum confinement and proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $\lambda$, and $\mu^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $\alpha^{2}F(\Omega)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $\mu^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.</description>

      <title>Topological and Planar Hall Effect in Monoclinic van der Waals Ferromagnet NbFeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as a critical class of quantum materials for next-generation, low-dimensional spintronic devices. In this study, we report a comprehensive study of the transport properties of the layered soft ferromagnet $\text{NbFeTe}_2$. We report the first observation of the topological Hall effect (THE) and the planar Hall effect (PHE) in metallic $\text{NbFeTe}_2$. THE signatures persist up to 45 K, while PHE remains evident well above Curie temperature ($T_C$). The observed negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, along with the PHE, provides strong evidence for a nontrivial electronic band structure. The coexistence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and a substantial THE: two key properties that are highly desirable for future spintronics applications, makes monoclinic vdW ferromagnetic $\text{NbFeTe}_2$ a promising platform to advance spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Epitaxial Films of the Bilayer Strontium Ruthenate: Sr$_{3}$Ru$_2$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on STO are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on LSAT are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $\Gamma$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $\Gamma$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.</description>

      <title>Spin Splitter and Inverse Effects in Altermagnetic Hybrid Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect. Our results provide theoretical explanations and predictions for several altermagnet hybrid structures.</description>

      <title>Topological photonics in one-dimensional settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, topological photonics has emerged as a vibrant field, attracting significant attention and witnessing remarkable advancements. This growth can be attributed to its fundamental appeal and the unique opportunities it offers for unconventional control of light, promising innovations in next-generation photonic devices. At the heart of topological photonics lies the one-dimensional (1D) SSH model. Originally conceived to elucidate the physics of a molecular chain of polyacetylene, this model has found widespread applications in exploring a wide range of topological phenomena in photonics and beyond. In this chapter, we aim to provide an overview of topological photonics in one-dimensional (1D) settings. After briefly introducing paradigmatic 1D models, including the SSH, Rice-Mele, and AAH models, we review recent advances in experimental studies and applications of topological photonics based on 1D platforms. Our discussion highlights demonstrated examples, such as the nonlinear tuning of topological states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian photonic SSH lattices, as well as nonlinear harmonic generation and topological lasing in SSH-type photonic microstructures. We further discuss characteristic topological phenomena in other representative 1D settings, including Floquet systems, topological pumping, quasicrystals, and synthetic non-Hermitian systems. Finally, we examine selected examples of two-dimensional (2D) photonic topological crystalline insulators that are closely linked to the SSH model. Towards the end, we summarize the chapter and provide a list of key contributions, together with an outlook on possible future directions in 1D topological photonics. While this review focuses specifically on 1D topological photonics, it is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive.</description>

      <title>Spatially and Temporally Resolved Mapping of Contact Electrification on Stand-Alone Ultrathin Glass Materials via Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact electrification (CE) remains a critical challenge in advanced material technologies where uncontrolled surface charging can compromise manufacturability, reliability, and performance in practical applications. Ultrathin glass with micrometer-scale thickness is a state-of-the-art specialty oxide material for flexible touchscreens in next-generation electronic devices. Here, we visualize and quantify CE-induced surface charges on ultrathin glass using sideband-mode Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Nanoscale atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes are used to scan and induce triboelectric charges on stand-alone glass surfaces under ultra-pure N$_2$ conditions. Time-dependent measurements reveal that surface charges on a 30~$\mu$m-thick glass sample decay from 4.47~V to 0.37~V over 240~minutes. Furthermore, electrostatic charges are found to exhibit capacitor-like discharging behavior primarily through the bulk material, yielding a long relaxation time constant of approximately 41~minutes. This behavior differs from the lateral surface discharging observed in thermally grown SiO$2$ thin films reported previously. A self-capacitance analytical model is developed to estimate the corresponding surface charge density ($\sigma$), yielding comparable values of 136.26~$\pm$~16.25~$\mu$C/m$^2$ at 30~$\mu$m and 131.44~$\pm$~28.41~$\mu$C/m$^2$ at 100~$\mu$m. Additionally, external bias applied to AFM tips can be used to enhance, suppress, or invert the intrinsic CE response of glass materials.</description>

      <title>From Connectivity to Rupture: A Coarse-Grained Stochastic Network Dynamics Approach to Polymer Network Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse-grained stochastic network dynamics (CGSND) framework for modeling deformation and rupture in polymer networks. The method replaces explicit molecular dynamics (MD) or coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) with network-level evolution rules while retaining chain entropic elasticity and force-controlled bond failure. Under uniaxial loading, CGSND reproduces the characteristic nonlinear stress--stretch response of elastomeric networks, including a well-defined ultimate tensile strength and post-peak softening due to progressive bond rupture. Comparison with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations shows that CGSND captures the qualitative form of the stress response and the onset of catastrophic damage despite its rate-independent formulation. Analysis of rupture kinetics reveals a pronounced peak in the bond-breaking hazard rate near the ultimate tensile strength in both approaches. In addition, the distribution of broken segment lengths remains statistically indistinguishable from the initial network, indicating that rupture is not biased toward short or long chains. Finally, the evolution of the Gini coefficient of bond force magnitudes reveals strong force localization preceding failure. These results demonstrate that CGSND provides a computationally efficient and physically interpretable framework for connecting force localization and rupture kinetics to macroscopic failure in polymer networks.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Collective Blinking and Photon Bunching from CsPbBr3 Quantum Dot Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of quantum light sources and search for quantum systems capable of supporting collective many-body states are crucial for further progress of modern quantum technologies. Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Mellin-Space Prony Representability of Linear Viscoelastic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear viscoelasticity is universally described by relaxation functions, which are continuous in relaxation times. Yet experimentally, measurements are necessarily discrete and band-limited, creating a fundamental gap between the continuous mathematical description and empirical observations. While Laplace-domain rational moduli admit finite Prony representations, using Mellin space analysis requires a deeper structural criterion. This work proves that finite Prony series representation holds if and only if the arithmetic pole lattices of Gamma factors in the Mellin transform of the complex modulus align exactly with those of a trial kernel, with residues satisfying decoupled first-order recurrences along aligned sublattices. This maximal criterion classifies classical models (Maxwell, standard linear solid) as finitely representable and fractional models (power-law, Cole--Cole, Zener, Gaussian) as transcendentally representable via infinite Prony ladders, yielding a complete analytical pole-lattice taxonomy of viscoelastic material models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a comprehensive first-principles investigation into the design and discovery of novel antimony oxychalcogenide monolayers Sb2X2O (X = S, Se) and Janus Sb2SSeO, examining their structural stability, elastic, electronic, optoelectronic, and photocatalytic properties. Our analysis confirms their thermodynamic and dynamical stability and reveals low cleavage energies, indicating strong feasibility for mechanical exfoliation. The excellent agreement between our HSE06-predicted bandgap of bulk Sb2S2O and experimental measurements further validates the employed computational framework. EWe also find that their optoelectronic responses can be efficiently tuned via biaxial strain, providing a viable route for device-specific property engineering. Favorable band alignments, strong optical absorption, efficient carrier transport, and relatively high dielectric constants collectively support their candidacy for overall water splitting under neutral conditions.These results establish a solid theoretical foundation for the rational design of Sb-based 2D nanostructures and highlight their potential in next-generation direction-dependent optoelectronic and sustainable energy-conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Germanium Thermophotovoltaic Devices Achieving 7.3% Efficiency Under High-Temperature Emission by Empirical Calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first empirical efficiency measurement of germanium-based thermophotovoltaic devices under high-temperature, high-irradiance conditions using a high view-factor calorimetric setup. Two TPV cell architectures were fabricated on p-type, highly doped (10^17 cm-3) Ge substrates, differing only in rear contact configuration. A standard device with a gold rear contact achieves a peak efficiency of 7.3 % and a power density of 1.77 W/cm2 at an emitter temperature of 1480 C, while a PERC-type device reaches 6.3 % efficiency and 1.22 W/cm2 at 1426 C. The superior performance of the standard device is attributed to lower series resistance, whereas the PERC design exhibits slightly higher efficiency at lower emitter temperatures (4.0 % vs. 3.8 % at 1150 C) due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity. A detailed TPV model has been developed and validated across both device architectures. The model identifies out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily caused by strong free-carrier absorption in the highly doped Ge substrate. Using this model, we predict device performance under idealized spectral conditions commonly assumed in prior literature. For a simulated AlN/W spectrally selective emitter, efficiencies as high as 22.3 % at 1800 C are obtained, consistent with previous semi-empirical predictions. In contrast, when previously reported Ge devices are modeled under the realistic graphite emitter spectrum used here, projected efficiencies decrease to as low as 8.1 % at 1480 C. These results show that earlier projections remain valid but idealized and underscore the importance of emitter spectral engineering and substrate optimization. Finally, we present the first direct comparison of Ge and InGaAs TPV devices under identical conditions, demonstrating the superior performance of InGaAs while confirming the cost-driven competitiveness of Ge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monoatomic chains with magnetic order in proximity of a s-wave superconductor can host Majorana edge modes. In this paper, we extend this idea to more complex spin-block chains such as the BaFe$_{2}$S$_{3}$ magnetic material that has a spin-ladder like structure. We investigate the topological phase diagram of such a system as function of the system parameters. We show that the coupling between chains within the ladder leads to the topological phase with a winding number larger than the sum of two single magnetic chains. Furthermore, strong coupling between chains leads to fractal-like substructure in the topological phase diagram. By investigating the real space properties of such a system and particularly its edge modes, we find that the system spectrum contains several in-gap states that we analyze in detail.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Optically-Detected Spin-Acoustic Resonance in Solid-State Molecular Thin-film</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of spin-acoustic resonance in pentacene thin films integrated on a high-quality-factor (high-Q) surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator on a lithium niobate substrate. Heterogeneous optically detected spin-acoustic resonance (HODSAR) is an optically detected spin-resonance measurement in which the resonant drive is delivered mechanically by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation. These results establish spin-acoustic resonance in a heterogeneously integrated molecular thin-film platform and provide a quantitative basis for benchmarking mechanically mediated spin control.</description>

      <title>Cutting Through the Noise: On-the-fly Outlier Detection for Robust Training of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of machine learning interatomic potentials suffers from reference data that contains numerical noise. Often originating from unconverged or inconsistent electronic-structure calculations, this noise is challenging to identify. Existing mitigation strategies such as manual filtering or iterative refinement of outliers, require either substantial expert effort or multiple expensive retraining cycles, making them difficult to scale to large datasets. Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, we validate its scalability by training a foundation model for organic chemistry on the SPICE dataset, where it reduces energy errors by a factor of three. This framework provides a simple, automated solution for training robust models on imperfect datasets across dataset sizes.</description>

      <title>Spin-active chlorine-related centers in 4H-SiC with telecom-band emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic resonance investigation of a defect in chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC is presented. This Cl-related center emits light at telecom wavelengths with zero-phonon lines in the range 1350-1540 nm. Its four configurations exhibit stable PL spectra characterized by narrow zero-phonon lines. For the two configurations that emit light at the C-band, a Debye-Waller factor in the range 22-25% is estimated. Optically detected magnetic resonance confirms that the Cl-related center is spin active and stable at room temperature with the zero-field splitting in the range of 1.0-1.4 GHz. The combined optical and spin properties suggest this center to be a highly promising candidate for scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Break-down of the relationship between {\alpha}-relaxation and equilibration in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glasses encode the memory of any thermo-mechanical treatment applied to them. This ability is associated to the existence of a myriad of metastable amorphous states which can be probed through different experimental pathways. It is usually assumed that this memory can be erased in the supercooled liquid, and that this process occurs on a time scale controlled by the {\alpha}-relaxation. We find that this assumption does not apply for hydrostatically compressed glasses. Annealing under pressure a prototypical metallic glass can irreversibly modify its dynamics, thermodynamics and structure, reduce the atomic mobility and lead to structural modifications of the first coordination shells which reduce the thermal stability with respect to a glass annealed in absence of pressure. When heated above their glass transition temperature, these compressed glasses do not convert into the pristine supercooled liquid, implying the existence of an additional process, beyond the {\alpha}-relaxation, contributing to the equilibrium recovery of the material. These results establish pressure as a powerful tool for engineering non-equilibrium glassy materials with tailored properties, while deepening our understanding of relaxation dynamics in disordered systems under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Grain boundaries amplify local chemical ordering in complex concentrated alloys</title>

Abstract: Local chemical ordering strongly influences the behavior of complex concentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the nanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains. Here, we study chemical ordering near grain boundaries, demonstrating they can act as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical order and drive the formation of compositional nanopatterns. Atomistic simulations reveal the development of composition waves with ordering vectors normal to the boundary plane in two distinct material systems, CrCoNi and NbMoTaW. These waves manifest as periodic enrichment-depletion patterns that reflect the underlying chemical ordering tendencies of each system, but with amplified contrast that extends several nanometers into the grain interior before gradually decaying. By examining multiple grain boundary orientations and alloys, we show that both the interfacial segregation profile and the crystallographic terminating plane govern the extent and character of this amplification. This interplay between boundary-dictated directional ordering and the diffuse, untemplated chemical domain evolution within the grain advances our understanding of interface-mediated ordering phenomena and suggests new opportunities for experimentally detecting local chemical order in complex concentrated alloys.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence and atomic-scale mechanisms of reduced dislocation mobility in an inorganic semiconductor under illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-plasticity in semiconductors, wherein their mechanical properties such as strength, hardness and ductility are influenced by light exposure, has been reported for several decades. Although such phenomena have drawn significant attention for the manufacturability and usage of deformable semiconductor devices, their underlying mechanisms are not well understood due to the lack of direct evidence. Here we provide experimental observation and atomic insights into the reduced mobility of dislocations in zinc sulfide, as a model material, under light. Using photo-nanoindentation and transmission electron microscopy, we observe that dislocations glide shorter distances under light than those in darkness and there are no apparent deformation twins in both conditions. By atomic-scale simulations, we demonstrate that the decreased dislocation mobility is attributed to the increased Peierls stress for dislocation motion and enhanced stress fields around dislocation cores due to photoexcitation. This study improves the understanding of photo-plastic effects in inorganic semiconductors, offering the opportunities for modulating their mechanical properties using light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positional polymorphism in solids refers to locally disordered unit cells that, on average, reproduce the high-symmetry structures observed in diffraction experiments. Standard theories of electron-phonon interactions fail to describe the temperature-dependent electronic structure of such polymorphous systems. Hybrid halide perovskites are a prime example, where configurational entropy from both polymorphism and molecular disorder plays a central role. Here we generalize the special displacement method to polymorphous crystals, providing an efficient ab initio framework for electron-phonon couplings without resorting to molecular dynamics. We resolve long-standing discrepancies in hybrid halide perovskite physics, including temperature-dependent anharmonic phonons and band gaps. Our approach provides a practical route to link local disorder, configurational entropy, and electron-phonon interactions, with applicability across diverse material classes, from optoelectronics and ferroelectrics to thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for electronic structure, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon calculations in locally disordered inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of data in modern materials science becomes more valuable and accurate when effects such as electron-phonon coupling and anharmonicity are included, providing a more realistic representation of finite-temperature material behavior. Furthermore, positional polymorphism, characterized by correlated local atomic disorder usually not reported by standard diffraction techniques, is a critical yet underexplored factor in understanding the electronic structure and transport properties of energy-efficient materials, like halide perovskites. In this manuscript, we present a first-principles methodology for locally disordered (polymorphous) cubic inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites, rooted in the special displacement method, that offers a systematic and alternative approach to molecular dynamics for exploring finite-temperature properties. By enabling a unified and efficient treatment of anharmonic lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and positional polymorphism, our approach generates essential data to predict temperature-dependent phonon properties, free energies, band gaps, and effective masses. Designed with a high-throughput spirit, this framework has been applied across a range of inorganic and hybrid halide perovskites: CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, CsSnI3, CsPbCl3, MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MASnI3, MAPbCl3, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, FASnI3, and FAPbCl3. We provide a comprehensive comparison between theoretical and experimental results and we systematically uncover trends and insights into their electronic and thermal behavior. For all compounds, we demonstrate strong and consistent correlations between local structural disorder, band gap openings, and effective mass enhancements.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Fluctuations in the Phonon Vacuum of Symmetric Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although time-reversal and inversion symmetry constrain the angular momentum of each phonon mode to vanish, we show that the vacuum state of crystals with such symmetries can nevertheless exhibit finite angular momentum fluctuations, which persist at finite temperature. These fluctuations arise from quantum coherence between nondegenerate modes with noncollinear polarizations and are encoded in the off-diagonal components of the angular momentum operator. Their origin lies in the noncommutativity between the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables time-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. Using a minimal model, we provide an intuitive picture of this phenomenon in terms of beating between linearly polarized modes, which generates a finite instantaneous angular momentum while remaining symmetry-forbidden in the mean. We further show that these vacuum fluctuations give rise to distinct finite-frequency spectral signatures and outline a concrete route for their detection using time-resolved spectroscopic probes sensitive to lattice polarization and symmetry. Our results identify a previously unexplored regime of lattice dynamics, revealing that even the symmetric phonon vacuum can harbor structured, dynamical angular-momentum correlations.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning interatomic potentials achieving CCSD(T) accuracy for systems with extended covalent networks and van der Waals interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy. MLIPs trained on coupled-cluster data, particularly CCSD(T), have emerged as a promising route to achieve chemical accuracy beyond the limits of density functional theory (DFT) and to incorporate non-empirical van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Most existing approaches are, however, still not straightforwardly applicable for systems with extended covalent networks such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) due to the limited availability of CCSD(T) for periodic systems. Here we present a methodology to train MLIPs with CCSD(T) accuracy for these systems. The approach uses the {\Delta}-learning method with a dispersion-corrected tight-binding baseline. This strategy enables training on compact molecular fragments while preserving transferability toward the periodic systems. Dispersion interactions are accounted for by adding vdW-bound multimers in the training set, and the combination with a vdW-aware tight-binding baseline allows the formally local MLIP to attain CCSD(T)-level accuracy even for systems dominated by long-range vdW forces. The resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional COF composed of carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. The developed methodology opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic simulations for systems with extended covalent networks and vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for large-scale optoelectronic property prediction</title>

Abstract: Predicting optoelectronic properties of large-scale atomistic systems under realistic conditions is crucial for rational materials design, yet computationally prohibitive with first-principles simulations. Recent neural network models have shown promise in overcoming these challenges, but typically require large datasets and lack physical interpretability. Physics-inspired approximate models offer greater data efficiency and intuitive understanding, but often sacrifice accuracy and transferability. Here we present HAMSTER, a physics-informed machine learning framework for predicting the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of complex chemical systems. Starting from an approximate model encoding essential physical effects, HAMSTER captures the critical influence of dynamic environments on Hamiltonians using only few explicit first-principles calculations. We demonstrate our approach on halide perovskites, achieving accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties across temperature and compositional variations, and scalability to systems containing tens of thousands of atoms. This work highlights the power of physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for accurate and interpretable optoelectronic property prediction in large, complex systems.</description>

Abstract: The brownmillerite-type barium indate (Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$) is a potential electrolyte for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in solid oxide fuel cells. Revealing the defect chemistry of this material is key to understanding its ionic and electronic conductivity. In this contribution, we report the existence of oxygen interstitials in a dumbbell configuration, which are also observed in In$_2$O$_3$. Using Density Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented by selected hybrid-functional calculations, we investigate vacancies, various oxygen interstitials, and Frenkel pairs. In doing so, we evaluate the formation energies, charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial pressure. Our results show that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other interstitial configurations exhibit charged states and become the prevailing compensating defects at high oxygen partial pressures, alongside oxygen vacancies. Our results provide a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic defects in barium indate, setting the stage for future investigations of the diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.</description>

      <title>Effect of FABr Over-Stoichiometry on the Morphology and Optoelectronic Properties of Wide-Bandgap FAPbBr_3 Films</title>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of formamidinium bromide (FABr) over-stoichiometry in the precursor solution on the optoelectronic properties and morphology of the resulting films of formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr_3). Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Predictive Inorganic Synthesis based on Machine Learning using Small Data sets: a case study of size-controlled Cu Nanoparticles</title>

Abstract: Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have a broad applicability, yet their synthesis is sensitive to subtle changes in reaction parameters. This sensitivity, combined with the time- and resource-intensive nature of experimental optimization, poses a major challenge in achieving reproducible and size-controlled synthesis. While Machine Learning (ML) shows promise in materials research, its application is often limited by scarcity of large high-quality experimental data sets. This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Additionally, classification models using both random forests and Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated to distinguish between large and small particles. While random forests show moderate performance, LLMs offer no significant advantages under data-scarce conditions. Overall, this study demonstrates that carefully curated small data sets, paired with robust classical ML, can effectively predict the synthesis of Cu NPs and highlights that for lab-scale studies, complex models like LLMs may offer limited benefit over simpler techniques.</description>

      <title>DFT modelling of stacking faults in hexagonal and cubic GaN</title>

Abstract: We have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to characterize the energetics, and the atomic and electronic structure, of stacking faults in GaN, both in the stable hexagonal wurtzite (wz) phase and in the metastable cubic zincblende (zb) phase. In wz GaN, SFs on the (0001) planes can be divided into three different intrinsic stacking faults (I1, I2, and I3) and oneextrinsic stacking fault (E). In zb GaN, SFs form along (111) directions, giving one type each of intrinsic, extrinsic and twin SFs. Based on the calculated formation energy, I1 is the most stable SF of wz GaN in agreement with experiment. For zb GaN, the intrinsic stacking fault is the most dominant planar defect. To characterize the effect of the stacking faults on the electronic structure of the material, we examined the band density. We found that the bands near the valence band maximum in wz GaN are localised on the Ga-polar side of the stacking fault (i.e. on the Ga side of the Ga-N bonds perpendicular to the SF), with the bands near the conduction band minimum more on the N-polar side, though somewhat delocalised. We found the opposite trend in zb GaN; this behaviour is caused by a redistribution of charge near the interface. We also show the band offsets for the stacking faults, finding that they are very sensitive to local conditions, but can all be described as type II interfaces, with the presence of a stacking fault reducing the gap locally.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical spectroscopy, and more generally, electronic-structure theory, are powerful concepts for describing the complex many-body interactions in materials. They comprise a variety of methods that can capture all aspects, from ground-state properties to lattice excitations to different types of light-matter interaction, including time-resolved variants. Modern electronic-structure codes implement either a few or several of these methods. Among them, exciting is an all-electron full-potential package that has a very rich portfolio of all levels of theory, with a particular focus on excitations. It implements the linearized augmented planewave plus local orbital (LAPW+LO) basis, which is known as the gold standard for solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory (DFT). Based on this, it also offers benchmark-quality results for a wide range of excited-state methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the features implemented in exciting in recent years, accompanied by short summaries on the state of the art of the underlying methodologies. They comprise DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) for phonons and electron-phonon coupling, and many-body perturbation theory in terms of the $GW$ approach and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Moreover, exciting can handle resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), pump-probe spectroscopy as well as exciton-phonon coupling (EXPC). Finally, we cover workflows and a view on data and machine learning (ML). All aspects are demonstrated with examples for scientifically relevant materials.</description>

      <title>Bending strain induced thermal conductivity suppression in freestanding BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes provide a novel platform for elastic strain engineering, enabling the manipulation of phonon transport free from substrate clamping. In this work, we investigate the thermal transport properties of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) membranes subjected to self-formed crease induced inhomogeneous strain. By integrating spatially resolved Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) with micro-Raman spectroscopy, we observe a sharp, localized suppression of thermal conductivity (k) in high-curvature regions. Specifically, k is reduced from 4.43 to 3.62 W/(m K) in SrTiO3 and from 2.27 to 1.81 W/(m K) in BaTiO3 at the crease centers, directly correlating with the local strain distribution. First-principles calculations reveal that, unlike uniform strain, the symmetry breaking induced by strain gradients significantly broadens phonon dispersion and enhances scattering rates. These findings not only elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing phonon-strain coupling but also demonstrate the potential of inhomogeneous strain fields as a potent tool for designing dynamic solid-state thermal switches and active thermal management devices.</description>

      <title>Upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy in multi-component cubic halide perovskite alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical properties intermediate between constituents of alloys can be achieved as downward convex positive bowing, upward concave negative bowing, or zero bowing. Such bowing effects are essential for band gap engineering in semiconductor alloys. Upward band gap bowing effects are rather rare, hindering the exploration on half of the available physical property space of alloys. Part of the this being a rare event is related to the need to stabilize an alloy with low mixing enthalpy, so it does not phase separate. In this paper we find via density functional theory that one can satisfy the simultaneous conditions of negative mixing enthalpy and upward band gap bowing in four-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys in the cubic perovskite structure. Such perovskite alloys have the B-site occupied by a mixture of group IVB and IIB elements that have the IVB-s and IIB-s states in the valence bands and conduction bands, respectively, leaving the delocalized s states strongly repel each other. This s-s repulsion leads to the upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpies simultaneously. Remarkably, we identify a perovskite alloy that has a band gap much larger than all its components. Analogous trends of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy also appear in the corresponding three-component and two-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys. These observations of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy will significantly accelerate the design of stable upward band gap bowing alloys in a broad range of material families.</description>

      <title>High-pressure X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy at fourth-generation synchrotron sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new experimental setup combining X-Ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) in the hard x-ray regime and a high-pressure sample environment is developed to monitor the pressure dependence of the internal motion of complex systems down to the atomic scale in the multi-gigapascal range, from room temperature to 600K. The high flux of coherent high energy x-rays at 4th generation synchrotron source solves the problems caused by the absorption of the Diamond Anvil Cells used to generate the high pressure, enabling the measurement of the intermediate scattering function over 6 orders of magnitude in time, from $10^{-3}$ s to $10^{3}$s. The constraints posed by the high-pressure generation such as the preservation of X-ray coherence, as well as the sample, pressure and temperature stability, are discussed, and the feasibility of high-pressure XPCS is demonstrated through results obtained on metallic glasses.</description>

      <title>Alignment behavior of 2D diopsides (d-silicates) under the influence of an AC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.</description>

      <title>Large spin signal and spin rectification in folded-bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a promising platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. Efficient spin injection creates a significant spin accumulation of 20 meV and generates a spin diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect is expected to arise from nonlinear spin-charge interactions in the folded-bilayer graphene channel. These observed large spin signals and spin-diode effects in graphene systems offer a promising platform for developing active two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional RMSD projections for reaction path visualization and validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient aware derivative Gaussian Process. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We demonstrate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a grignard rearrangement, and a bicyclobutadiene rearrangement.</description>

      <title>Ising Supercriticality and Universal Magnetocalorics in Spiral Antiferromagnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality of phase transitions and critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a metamagnetic transition line with a critical endpoint (CEP) and corresponding Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP is located at $\mu_0H_{\mathrm{c}} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_{\mathrm{c}} \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a highly sensitive field dependence in the magnetic cooling near the emergent CEP, characterized by a divergent magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio following $\Gamma_H \propto 1/t^{\beta+\gamma-1}$, with $\beta + \gamma \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T-T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK, achieved from the initial condition of 2 K and 4 T. The findings here pave the way for studying supercritical phenomena and magnetic cooling in rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method with Hessian Eigenmode Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within harmonic transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for the transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that switches between the CI-NEB and the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction of energy and force calculations by 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. Calculations of the BC set where a simple switch from the CI-NEB to the MMF method is made when the magnitude of the atomic forces drops below 0.5 eV/AA requires 30% more force calculations than the OCI-NEB algorithm. These results show that an adaptive hybrid method mixing CI-NEB and MMF can be a highly efficient tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</description>

Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Radial gradient of superionic hydrogen in Earth's inner core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen is considered a major light element in Earth's core, yet the thermodynamics of its superionic phase and its distribution in the inner core remain unclear. Here, we compute ab initio Gibbs free energies for liquid and superionic hcp and bcc Fe-H phases and construct the superionic-liquid phase diagram over pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the Earth's inner core. We find that phase diagrams at different inner-core pressures collapse when temperatures are scaled by the melting temperature of pure iron, indicating that solid-liquid partitioning is controlled primarily by a reduced temperature relative to iron melting and is weakly sensitive to pressure. This scaling relation further reconciles previously reported discrepancies in partition coefficients among theoretical studies and yields good agreement with available experimental data at low pressures. By applying thermochemical constraints, our free-energy results reveal a radial hydrogen gradient within the inner core. These results demonstrate that compositional gradients of superionic hydrogen in the inner core emerge naturally from equilibrium thermodynamics and suggest a general mechanism governing the depth-dependent distribution of light elements within Earth's inner core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moir\'e superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.</description>
