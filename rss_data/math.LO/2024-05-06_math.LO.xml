      <title>Zilber's Trichotomy in Hausdorff Geometric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new axiomatic treatment of the Zilber trichotomy, and use it to complete the proof of the trichotomy for relics of algebraically closed fields, i.e., reducts of the ACF-induced structure on ACF-definable sets. More precisely, we introduce a class of geometric structures equipped with a Hausdorff topology, called \textit{Hausdorff geometric structures}. Natural examples include the complex field; algebraically closed valued fields; o-minimal expansions of real closed fields; and characteristic zero Henselian fields (in particular $p$-adically closed fields). We then study the Zilber trichotomy for relics of Hausdorff geometric structures, showing that under additional assumptions, every non-locally modular strongly minimal relic on a real sort interprets a one-dimensional group. Combined with recent results, this allows us to prove the trichotomy for strongly minimal relics on the real sorts of algebraically closed valued fields.
  Finally, we make progress on the imaginary sorts, reducing the trichotomy for \textit{all} ACVF relics (in all sorts) to a conjectural technical condition that we prove in characteristic $(0,0)$.</description>

      <title>Cut elimination for Cyclic Proofs: A Case Study in Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider modal logic extended with the well-known temporal operator `eventually' and provide a cut-elimination procedure for a cyclic sequent calculus that captures this fragment. The work showcases an adaptation of the reductive cut-elimination method to cyclic calculi. Notably, the proposed algorithm applies to a cyclic proof and directly outputs a cyclic cut-free proof without appealing to intermediate machinery for regularising the end proof.</description>

      <title>Continuum Many Different Things: Localisation, Anti-Localisation and Yorioka Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.11614v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining creature forcing approaches from arXiv:1003.3425 and arXiv:1402.0367, we show that, under CH, there is a proper $\omega^\omega$-bounding poset with $\aleph_2$-cc that forces continuum many pairwise different cardinal characteristics, parametrised by reals, for each one of the following six types: uniformity and covering numbers of Yorioka ideals as well as both kinds of localisation and anti-localisation cardinals, respectively. This answers several open questions from arXiv:1805.11005.</description>

      <title>Filtrations for $\mathbb{wK4}$ and its relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite model property of subframe logics with expressible transitive reflexive closure modality. For $m&gt;0$, let $\mathrm{L}_m$ be the logic given by axiom $\lozenge^{m+1} p\to \lozenge p\vee p$. We construct filtrations for the logics $\mathrm{L}_m$. It follows that these logics and their tense counterparts have the finite model property. Then we show that every canonical subframe logic that contains $\mathrm{L}_m$ have the finite model property.</description>

      <title>Does $\mathcal P(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$ know its right hand from its left?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ denote the shift automorphism on $\mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$, defined by setting $\sigma([A]) = [A+1]$ for all $A \subseteq \omega$. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies the shift automorphism $\sigma$ and its inverse $\sigma^{-1}$ are conjugate in the automorphism group of $\mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$.
  Due to work of van Douwen and Shelah, it has been known since the 1980's that it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ that $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$ are not conjugate. Our result shows that the question of whether $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$ are conjugate is independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$.
  As a corollary to the main theorem, we deduce that the structures $\langle \mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin},\sigma \rangle$ and $\langle \mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin},\sigma^{-1} \rangle$ are elementarily equivalent in the language of algebraic dynamical systems (Boolean algebras together with an automorphism). This corollary does not depend on the Continuum Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Complexity in Tame Quantum Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the notion that physical systems can contain only a finite amount of information or complexity, we introduce a framework that allows for quantifying the amount of logical information needed to specify a function or set. We then apply this methodology to a variety of physical systems and derive the complexity of parameter-dependent physical observables and coupling functions appearing in effective Lagrangians. In order to implement these ideas, it is essential to consider physical theories that can be defined in an o-minimal structure. O-minimality, a concept from mathematical logic, encapsulates a tameness principle. It was recently argued that this property is inherent to many known quantum field theories and is linked to the UV completion of the theory. To assign a complexity to each statement in these theories one has to further constrain the allowed o-minimal structures. To exemplify this, we show that many physical systems can be formulated using Pfaffian o-minimal structures, which have a well-established notion of complexity. More generally, we propose adopting sharply o-minimal structures, recently introduced by Binyamini and Novikov, as an overarching framework to measure complexity in quantum theories.</description>
