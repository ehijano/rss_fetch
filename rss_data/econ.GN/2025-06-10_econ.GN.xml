      <title>Impact of COVID-19 on The Bullwhip Effect Across U.S. Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bullwhip Effect, describing the amplification of demand variability up the supply chain, poses significant challenges in Supply Chain Management. This study examines how the COVID-19 pandemic intensified the Bullwhip Effect across U.S. industries, using extensive industry-level data. By focusing on the manufacturing, retailer, and wholesaler sectors, the research explores how external shocks exacerbate this phenomenon. Employing both traditional and advanced empirical techniques, the analysis reveals that COVID-19 significantly amplified the Bullwhip Effect, with industries displaying varied responses to the same external shock. These differences suggest that supply chain structures play a critical role in either mitigating or intensifying the effect. By analyzing the dynamics during the pandemic, this study provides valuable insights into managing supply chains under global disruptions and highlights the importance of tailoring strategies to industry-specific characteristics.</description>

      <title>Nexus of Team Collaboration Stability on Mega Construction Project Success in Electric Vehicle Manufacturing Enterprises: The Moderating Role of Human-AI Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how team collaboration stability influences the success of mega construction projects in electric vehicle manufacturing enterprises, with human-AI integration as a moderating variable. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) with data from 187 project teams across China's electric vehicle sector, results indicate that team collaboration stability significantly enhances project success. The moderating effect of human-AI integration strengthens this relationship, suggesting that enterprises implementing advanced human-AI collaborative systems achieve superior project outcomes when team stability is maintained. These findings contribute to both team collaboration theory and provide practical implications for mega project management in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle industry.</description>

      <title>Improving choice model specification using reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete choice modelling is a theory-driven modelling framework for understanding and forecasting choice behaviour. To obtain behavioural insights, modellers test several competing model specifications in their attempts to discover the 'true' data generation process. This trial-and-error process requires expertise, is time-consuming, and relies on subjective theoretical assumptions. Although metaheuristics have been proposed to assist choice modellers, they treat model specification as a classic optimisation problem, relying on static strategies, applying predefined rules, and neglecting outcomes from previous estimated models. As a result, current metaheuristics struggle to prioritise promising search regions, adapt exploration dynamically, and transfer knowledge to other modelling tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based framework where an 'agent' specifies models by estimating them and receiving rewards based on goodness-of-fit and parsimony. Results demonstrate the agent dynamically adapts its strategies to identify promising specifications across data generation processes, showing robustness and potential transferability, without prior domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Tourist Experience on Revisit Decisions with the Mediation of Tourist Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nusliko Park Ecotourism Area is a combination of natural and artificial tourism with the background of Lake Nusliko, which can be developed as a leading tourist attraction. Marketing strategies can be formulated by analyzing the factors influencing the decision to revisit. The decision to revisit is a key indicator that shows the success of a tourism marketing strategy. This study aimed to test and analyze the relationship between tourist experience and tourist satisfaction with the decision to revisit the Nusliko Park Ecotourism area. This type of research is descriptive research. The population in this study was visitors to the Nusliko Park Ecotourism area. The sample criteria were visitors who had visited the Nusliko Park Ecotourism area at least twice and were domiciled in North Maluku. Data were collected through questionnaires, and 114 questionnaires were returned. The research method used non-probability sampling with purposive sampling techniques. These two techniques were used to make it easier for the author to obtain samples because the Nusliko Park Ecotourism area was closed when the research was conducted. After all, it was under repair. Data were processed and analyzed using SEM and through SmartPLS 4.0 software. The study results indicate that the tourist experience and satisfaction positively influence the decision to revisit. Through this study, the satisfaction variable was also found to mediate the relationship between the tourist experience and the decision to revisit</description>

      <title>Solving Nash Equilibria in Nonlinear Differential Games for Common-Pool Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many resources are provided by an ecological system that is vulnerable to tipping when exceeding a certain level of pollution, with a sudden big loss of ecosystem services. An ecological system is usually also a common-pool resource and therefore vulnerable to suboptimal use resulting from non-cooperative behavior. An analysis requires methods to derive cooperative and non-cooperative solutions for managing a dynamical system with tipping points. Such a game is a differential game which has two well-defined non-cooperative solutions, the open-loop and feedback Nash equilibria. This paper provides new numerical methods for deriving open-loop and feedback Nash equilibria, for one-dimensional and two-dimensional dynamical systems. The methods are applied to the lake game, which is the classical example for these types of problems. Especially, two-dimensional feedback Nash equilibria are a novelty of this paper. This Nash equilibrium is close to the cooperative solution which has important policy implications.</description>

      <title>(In)stability in the Dynamics of the Cross-Country Distribution of Income Per Capita</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a panel of 102 countries from PWT 10.0 covering 1970-2019, we examine the veracity of the assumption that a time-homogeneous, first-order process describes the evolution of the cross-country distribution of per capita output, an assumption often made in studies of the convergence hypothesis employing the distribution dynamics approach pioneered by Quah (1993). To test homogeneity, we compare transition kernels estimated for different time periods and, for those periods exhibiting evidence of homogeneity, we test the first-order assumption using an implication of such a process's Chapman-Kolmogorov equations. Both tests require measurement of the distance between probability distributions which we do with several different metrics, employing bootstrap methods to assess the statistical significance of the observed distances. We find that the process was time-homogeneous and first-order in the 1970-1995 period during which the distribution dynamics imply a bimodal long-run distribution, consistent with convergence clubs. Following the apparent break in the process in the late 1990s, the 2000-2010 distribution dynamics imply a unimodal long-run distribution suggestive of a single convergence club, consistent with recent claims of short-term beta-convergence from the late 1990s and beyond made by Patel et al. (2021) and Kremer et al (2022). After 2010, there is some evidence of a return to non-convergent dynamics similar to those of the 1970-1995 period.</description>

      <title>Do conditional cash transfers in childhood increase economic resilience in adulthood? Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic shock in Ecuador</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary goal of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) is to alleviate short-term poverty while preventing the intergenerational transmission of deprivation by promoting the accumulation of human capital among children. Although a substantial body of research has evaluated the short-run impacts of CCTs, studies on their long-term effects are relatively scarce, and evidence regarding their influence on resilience to future economic shocks is limited. As human capital accumulation is expected to enhance individuals' ability to cope with risk and uncertainty during turbulent periods, we investigate whether receiving a conditional cash transfer -- specifically, the Human Development Grant (HDG) in Ecuador -- during childhood improves the capacity to respond to unforeseen exogenous economic shocks in adulthood, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and leveraging merged administrative data, we do not find an overall effect of the HDG on the target population. Nevertheless, we present evidence that individuals who were eligible for the programme and lived in rural areas (where previous works have found the largest effects in terms of on short-term impact) during their childhood, approximately 12 years before the pandemic, exhibited greater economic resilience to the pandemic. In particular, eligibility increased the likelihood of remaining employed in the formal sector during some of the most challenging phases of the COVID-19 crisis. The likely drivers of these results are the weak conditionality of the HDG and demand factors given the limited ability of the formal economy to absorb labour, even if more educated.</description>

      <title>The impact of extracurricular education on socioeconomic mobility in Japan: an application of causal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the socioeconomic impacts of extracurricular education, specifically private tutoring, on social mobility in Japan. Using data from the 2015 National Survey on Social Stratification and Social Mobility (SSM), we employed a causal machine learning approach to evaluate this educational intervention on income, educational attainment, and occupational prestige. Our research suggests that while shadow education holds the potential for positive socioeconomic impacts, its benefits are undermined by the economic disparities among households, resulting in minimal overall improvement. This highlights the complex mechanisms between individual demographics and educational interventions, revealing promising machine learning applications in this field.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable AI-Assisted Misinformation Inoculation: Protecting Confidence Against False Election Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalizable AI-assisted framework for rapidly generating effective "prebunking" interventions against misinformation. Like mRNA vaccine platforms, our approach uses a stable template structure that can be quickly adapted to counter emerging false narratives. In a preregistered two-wave experiment with 4,293 U.S. registered voters, we test this framework against politically-charged election misinformation -- one of the most challenging domains for misinformation intervention. Our design directly tests scalability by comparing human-reviewed and purely AI-generated inoculation messages. We find that LLM-generated prebunking significantly reduced belief in election rumors (persisting for at least one week) and increased confidence in election integrity across partisan lines. Purely AI-generated messages proved as effective as human-reviewed versions, with some achieving larger protective effects, demonstrating that effective misinformation inoculation can be achieved at machine speed without proportional human effort, offering a scalable defense against the accelerating threat of false narratives across all domains.</description>

      <title>Blameocracy: Causal Attribution in Political Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a supervised method to detect causal attribution in political texts, distinguishing between expressions of merit and blame. Analyzing four million tweets shared by U.S. Congress members from 2012 to 2023, we document a pronounced shift toward causal attribution following the 2016 presidential election. The shift reflects changes in rhetorical strategy rather than compositional variation in the actors or topics of the political debate. Within causal communication, a trade-off emerges between positive and negative tone, with power status as the key determinant: government emphasizes merit, while opposition casts blame. This pattern distinguishes causal from purely affective communication. Finally, we show that blame is markedly more viral than merit, with this gap widening in the upper tail of the virality distribution, where blame is increasingly more prevalent among the most widely shared tweets.</description>

      <title>On long-duration storage, weather uncertainty and limited foresight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is a key component for fully renewable, sector-coupled energy systems based on wind and solar. While capacity expansion planning has begun to take into account interannual weather variability, it often ignores weather uncertainty and limited foresight in capacity and operational decisions. We build a stochastic capacity expansion model for fully decarbonized energy systems with LDES in Europe accounting for weather uncertainty - isolating the effect of limited foresight by comparing it to a perfect foresight benchmark. Under limited foresight, LDES acts as a hedge against extreme system states operating defensively and exhibiting a stockpiling effect absent under perfect foresight. Solar PV gains in system value for its higher predictability with up to 25\% higher capacities versus the benchmark while onshore wind capacities are lower. We shed light on the underlying mechanisms by deriving implicit LDES bidding curves. We show that LDES bids reflect the costs and the weather-dependent probability of extreme system states conditional on the current system state. This has important implications for the price formation on renewable electricity markets, as a wide and continuous range of probabilistic LDES bids alleviates concerns of extreme price disparity at high renewable shares.</description>

      <title>Simulating Macroeconomic Expectations using LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectation formation using Large Language Model-Empowered Agents (LLM Agents). By constructing thousands of LLM Agents equipped with modules for personal characteristics, prior expectations, and knowledge, we replicate a survey experiment involving households and experts on inflation and unemployment. Our results show that although the expectations and thoughts generated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of human participants, they still effectively capture key heterogeneity across agents and the underlying drivers of expectation formation. Furthermore, a module-ablation exercise highlights the critical role of prior expectations in simulating such heterogeneity. This approach complements traditional survey methods and offers new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research.</description>

      <title>Grounded Persuasive Language Generation for Automated Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring factuality of content generation.</description>
