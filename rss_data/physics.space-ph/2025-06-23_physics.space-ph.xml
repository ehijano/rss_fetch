      <title>Two Types of $1/f$ Range in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfv\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfv\'enic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfv\'enic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfv\'enic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfv\'enic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.</description>

      <title>The largest Forbush decrease in 20 years: Preliminary analysis of SEVAN network observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a preliminary analysis of the largest Forbush Decrease (FD) observed in solar cycle 25 using SEVAN network data. Triggered by consecutive Earth-directed CMEs on May 30 and 31, 2025, this event produced two distinct FD minima and a prolonged recovery, with significant anisotropies in cosmic ray response across the network. The timing of interplanetary shock arrivals was confirmed by SSC signatures at 05:22 UTC on June 1 and 10:19 UTC on June 2, marking the onset of each FD phase. The depth and temporal structure of the FD varied across SEVAN detectors, providing insights into the complex heliospheric and magnetospheric dynamics during this multi-CME event.</description>

      <title>In pursuit of the low-energy Solar neutron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of low-energy solar neutrons flux is crucial for probing solar energetic processes and neutron transport mechanisms in interplanetary space. This study investigates the role of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in modulating the low-energy solar neutrons. The neutron flux is modeled by incorporating a CME-width scaling factor into existing neutron fluence models. Our analysis, based on CME data from the SECHHI COR2 database during the DANSON experiment (2016-10-27 to 2017-03-17), identified narrow-width (20$^\circ$ $&lt;$ $\alpha$ $&lt;$ 80$^\circ$) and fast (v $&gt;$ 800 km/s) CMEs as key contributors to neutron production. The revised model predicts a neutron flux of 5 - 49 neutrons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 AU for a neutron travel time of 1.66 hours, aligning with previous reports. Additionally, the estimated total flux of 2.45 MeV neutrons over a 4-hour period accounts for 10.23\% of DANSON's total flux. These findings suggest that CME-driven mechanisms may significantly influence the low-energy solar neutron flux. More observational efforts are needed to refine neutron flux estimates and improve background subtraction techniques for spaceborne neutron detectors.</description>

      <title>On quasi-periodic decameter radio emission from Jupiter related to Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper discusses the possibility of implementing a plasma generation mechanism in a source of decameter radio emission associated with Ganymede and an explanation based on this mechanism of forming quasi-periodic sequences of bursts of this radiation. According to the discussed model, the registered quasi-periodic sequences of radiation pulses are a consequence of implementing in the source a pulsating mode of plasma wave conversion into extraordinary electromagnetic waves with a small refractive index. The negative frequency drift of the radiation observed in the frequency-time spectrogram is due to the group delay of waves with a small refractive index and the dispersion of the medium. Based on the plasma model, estimates of the plasma parameters in the generation region are obtained, which are in agreement with the data obtained as a result of satellite measurements.</description>

      <title>To Flow or Not To Flow? The granular Bond number to predict clogging in low gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In granular hopper flow, is the clogging probability influenced by gravity? Clogging, the spontaneous arrest of granular flow through a constriction, is a fundamental and widespread phenomenon in granular processing. Accurately predicting clogging risk is essential for space-related activities. Yet, conflicting results leave us without a reliable way to extrapolate terrestrial data to low gravity. We introduce an in-bulk definition of the dimensionless granular Bond number, B, to scale clogging probability from Earth gravity to low gravity. By testing multiple lunar regolith simulants in Earth and Moon gravitational accelerations, using an active drop tower, we reveal that low gravity significantly increases clogging risk, challenging previous findings. We observe a gravity-induced shift in the critical orifice below which clogging occurs by up to one order of magnitude. Scaling data with the Bond number unifies scattered results into a state diagram predicting clogging across materials and gravitational accelerations. Our findings provide a practical tool for anticipating granular clogging in reduced gravity, informing future space missions.</description>
