      <title>Leveraging 3D Technologies for Hardware Security: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D die stacking and 2.5D interposer design are promising technologies to improve integration density, performance and cost. Current approaches face serious issues in dealing with emerging security challenges such as side channel attacks, hardware trojans, secure IC manufacturing and IP piracy. By utilizing intrinsic characteristics of 2.5D and 3D technologies, we propose novel opportunities in designing secure systems. We present: (i) a 3D architecture for shielding side-channel information; (ii) split fabrication using active interposers; (iii) circuit camouflage on monolithic 3D IC, and (iv) 3D IC-based security processing-in-memory (PIM). Advantages and challenges of these designs are discussed, showing that the new designs can improve existing countermeasures against security threats and further provide new security features.</description>

      <title>MC for Gastroretentive Drug Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a biological material produced by non-pathogenic bacteria that possesses excellent material properties for various medical applications, has received increased interest as a carrier system for drug delivery. However, the vast majority of existing studies on drug release from BNC are feasibility studies with modeling and design aspects remaining largely unexplored. To narrow this research gap, this paper proposes a novel model for the drug release from BNC. Specifically, the drug delivery system considered in this paper consists of a BNC fleece coated with a polymer. The polymer coating is used as an additional diffusion barrier, enabling the controlled release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The proposed physics-based model reflects the geometry of the BNC and incorporates the impact of the polymer coating on the drug release. Hence, it can be useful for designing BNC-based drug delivery systems in the future. The accuracy of the model is validated with experimental data obtained in wet lab experiments.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Sensors and Autonomous Driving: Technologies, Limitations, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a transformative sensing modality for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) applications, enabling material-level scene understanding through fine spectral resolution beyond the capabilities of traditional RGB imaging. This paper presents the first comprehensive review of HSI for automotive applications, examining the strengths, limitations, and suitability of current HSI technologies in the context of ADAS/AD. In addition to this qualitative review, we analyze 216 commercially available HSI and multispectral imaging cameras, benchmarking them against key automotive criteria: frame rate, spatial resolution, spectral dimensionality, and compliance with AEC-Q100 temperature standards. Our analysis reveals a significant gap between HSI's demonstrated research potential and its commercial readiness. Only four cameras meet the defined performance thresholds, and none comply with AEC-Q100 requirements. In addition, the paper reviews recent HSI datasets and applications, including semantic segmentation for road surface classification, pedestrian separability, and adverse weather perception. Our review shows that current HSI datasets are limited in terms of scale, spectral consistency, the number of spectral channels, and environmental diversity, posing challenges for the development of perception algorithms and the adequate validation of HSI's true potential in ADAS/AD applications. This review paper establishes the current state of HSI in automotive contexts as of 2025 and outlines key research directions toward practical integration of spectral imaging in ADAS and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>HPC Digital Twins for Evaluating Scheduling Policies, Incentive Structures and their Impact on Power and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20016v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schedulers are critical for optimal resource utilization in high-performance computing. Traditional methods to evaluate schedulers are limited to post-deployment analysis, or simulators, which do not model associated infrastructure. In this work, we present the first-of-its-kind integration of scheduling and digital twins in HPC. This enables what-if studies to understand the impact of parameter configurations and scheduling decisions on the physical assets, even before deployment, or regarching changes not easily realizable in production. We (1) provide the first digital twin framework extended with scheduling capabilities, (2) integrate various top-tier HPC systems given their publicly available datasets, (3) implement extensions to integrate external scheduling simulators. Finally, we show how to (4) implement and evaluate incentive structures, as-well-as (5) evaluate machine learning based scheduling, in such novel digital-twin based meta-framework to prototype scheduling. Our work enables what-if scenarios of HPC systems to evaluate sustainability, and the impact on the simulated system.</description>

      <title>Heating reduction as collective action: Impact on attitudes, behavior and energy consumption in a Polish field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heating and hot water usage account for nearly 80% of household energy consumption in the European Union. In order to reach the EU New Deal goals, new policies to reduce heat energy consumption are indispensable. However, research targeting reductions concentrates either on technical building interventions without considerations of people's behavior, or psychological interventions with no technical interference. Such interventions can be promising, but their true potential for scaling up can only be realized by testing approaches that integrate behavioral and technical solutions in tandem rather than in isolation. In this research, we study a mix of psychological and technical interventions targeting heating and hot water demand among students in Polish university dormitories. We evaluate effects on building energy consumption, behavioral spillovers and on social beliefs and attitudes in a pre-post quasi-experimental mixed-method field study in three student dormitories. Our findings reveal that the most effective approaches to yield energy savings were a direct, collectively framed request to students to reduce thermostat settings for the environment, and an automated technical adjustment of the heating curve temperature. Conversely, interventions targeting domestic hot water had unintended effects, including increased energy use and negative spillovers, such as higher water consumption. Further, we find that informing students about their active, collective participation had a positive impact on perceived social norms. Our findings highlight the importance of trialing interventions in controlled real-world settings to understand the interplay between technical systems, behaviors, and social impacts to enable scalable, evidence-based policies driving an effective and sustainable energy transition.</description>

      <title>Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Full Potential of RRAMs through Scalable and Distributed In-Memory Computing with Integrated Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exponential growth in global computing demand is exacerbated due to the higher-energy requirements of conventional architectures, primarily due to energy-intensive data movement. In-memory computing with Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) addresses this by co-integrating memory and processing, but faces significant hurdles related to device-level non-idealities and poor scalability for large computing tasks. Here, we introduce MELISO+ (In-Memory Linear Solver), a full-stack, distributed framework for energy-efficient in-memory computing. MELISO+ proposes a novel two-tier error correction mechanism to mitigate device non-idealities and develops a distributed RRAM computing framework to enable matrix computations exceeding dimensions of $65,000\times65,000$. This approach reduces first- and second-order arithmetic errors due to device non-idealities by over $90\%$, enhances energy efficiency by three to five orders of magnitude, and decreases latency 100-fold. Hence, MELISO+ allows lower-precision RRAM devices to outperform high-precision device alternatives in accuracy, energy and latency metrics. By unifying algorithm-hardware co-design with scalable architecture, MELISO+ significantly advances sustainable, high-dimensional computing suitable for applications like large language models and generative AI.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum Supercomputing: A demonstration of a multi-user, multi-QPU and multi-GPU environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving a practical quantum advantage for near-term applications is widely expected to rely on hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. To deliver this practical advantage to users, high performance computing (HPC) centers need to provide a suitable software and hardware stack that supports algorithms of this type. In this paper, we describe the world's first implementation of a classical-quantum environment in an HPC center that allows multiple users to execute hybrid algorithms on multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) and GPUs. Our setup at the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PCSS) aligns with current HPC norms: the computing hardware including QPUs is installed in an active data center room with standard facilities; there are no special considerations for networking, power, and cooling; we use Slurm for workload management as well as the NVIDIA CUDA-Q extension API for classical-quantum interactions. We demonstrate applications of this environment for hybrid classical-quantum machine learning and optimisation. The aim of this work is to provide the community with an experimental example for further research and development on how quantum computing can practically enhance and extend HPC capabilities.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Fidelity for Functional Neural Network Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroscientists face challenges in analyzing high-dimensional neural recording data of dense functional networks. Without ground-truth reference data, finding the best algorithm for recovering neurologically relevant networks remains an open question. We implemented hybrid quantum algorithms to construct functional networks and compared them with the results of documented classical techniques. We demonstrated that our quantum state fidelity methods can provide competitive alternatives to classical metrics by revealing distinct functional networks. Our results suggest that quantum computing offers a viable and potentially advantageous alternative for data-driven modeling in neuroscience, underscoring its broader applicability in high-dimensional graph inference and complex system analysis.</description>
