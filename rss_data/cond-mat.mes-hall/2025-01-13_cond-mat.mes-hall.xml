      <title>Topological advantage for adsorbate chemisorption on conjugated chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological matter shows promise for applications in quantum information and transport. In this work, we examined the electronic and vibronic properties of a prototype molecular system adsorbed to the edges, domain walls, and the bulk of a Su-Schrieffer Hegger polyacetylene chain in the trivial, metallic, and topological phases. Our results reveal that suitable molecular observables show signatures of the topological phase transition and imply the topological phase has a significant advantage and robustness over the metallic phase for electron donation into the molecular system. This advantage persists in the presence of defects and suggests applications of topological materials in molecular catalysis and sensing.</description>

      <title>Tuning Quantum States at Chirality-Reversed Planar Interface in Weyl Semimetals using an Interstitial Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic band structure of Weyl semimetals possesses pairs of linear band crossings, called Weyl nodes, characterized by opposite chirality charges associated with each node. The momentum space position of the nodes can reverse across a planar interface and these host Fermi-arc-like bound states, in addition to scattering states. We show that a magnetic interstitial layer can tune these states in three distinct ways. The electrostatic potential and one of the in-plane magnetic potential components control the shape of the bound state Fermi-arcs. For moderate values of the same in-plane magnetic potential electrons are spin-filtered across the interface, while both the in-plane magnetic components and the electrostatic potential control the transmission of electrons. The ratio of in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic components can be used to turn on or turn off the magnetic potential effects, since the latter does not affect the interface states. The tunability arises from spin-momentum locking and chirality reversal at the interface. Thus, the effects can mix or interchange depending on the specific material but the states will remain tunable.</description>

      <title>Band structure evolution from kagome to Lieb under periodic driving field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the light-induced transition of the kagome quasienergy spectrum to the Lieb like band structure under periodic driving fields. A generalized framework for the renormalized hopping potential is derived, applicable to any two-dimensional lattice with arbitrary field polarizations. By applying this framework to a kagome lattice driven by linearly polarized light in off-resonant condition, we demonstrate the ability to tune the hopping strength along specific bonds to zero. This tuning induces the merging of Dirac points at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, governed by the field parameters. At specific parameter values, this merging facilitates a transition from the kagome quasienergy spectrum to the Lieb band structure with reduced bandwidth. Our results highlight the critical role of controlled electron hopping in driving this electronic transition, offering valuable insights into the manipulation of electronic properties in periodically driven systems.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic nonlinear acoustic valley Hall effect in the massive Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear acoustic valley Hall effect (AVHE), a recently discovered novel acoustically driven phenomena, has sparked extensive interests in valleytronics. So far, only the intrinsic contributions from band structure (Berry curvature or asymmetric energy dispersions) to nonlinear AVHE have been investigated. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonlinear AVHE from both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal massive Dirac materials with disorders based on the Boltzmann formalism and also concretely analyse the behaviours of nonlinear AVHE in disordered monolayer MoS2. It's found that the extrinsic contributions (side jump and skew scattering) can also give rise to a pure nonlinear AVHE in the 2D hexagonal massive Dirac materials. Remarkably, the extrinsic mechanisms dominate the nonlinear AVHE in the disordered monolayer MoS2.</description>

      <title>Unconventional enhancement of anomalous Hall effect by tilt of Zeeman field in topologically-nontrivial MXenes, $M_2M'$C$_2$O$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the anomalous Hall effect of topologically-nontrivial MXenes, $M_2M'$C$_2$O$_2$, and the electronic structure in the presence of magnetic proximity effect is theoretically investigated. The theoretical analysis is performed in two different ways: an effective model and a multi-orbital tight-binding model generated from the first-principles band structure. These two theoretical methods provided the similar profile of Berry curvature for electronic states near the bulk band gap, and they show an unconventional rise of hollowed-out peak in the profile with the tilt of proximity magnetic potential. The anomalous Hall conductivity is also calculated as a function of the charge density and the tilt angle of proximity magnetic order. Then, an unconventional enhancement of anomalous Hall conductivity by the tilt of magnetic order is theoretically predicted as a result of the variation of Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Large spin accumulation signals in ultrafast magneto-optical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical techniques have become essential tools in spintronics, enabling the investigation of spin dynamics in the ultrafast regime. A key challenge in this field has been to accurately isolate the contributions to magneto-optical signals of spin transport phenomena from the local magnetization dynamics. The contribution of transported and accumulated spins was long believed to be orders of magnitude smaller than that of the magnetization and thus previous approaches to disentangle these signals have relied on specific experimental designs, usually including thick metal layers. Here, we present experimental evidence demonstrating that the magneto-optical signal from ultrafast spin accumulations can, under certain conditions, be comparable to or even exceed that of the magnetic layer in a standard ultrafast demagnetization experiment. Our findings provide a new framework for accessing and isolating these spin accumulations, allowing for time and depth dependent probing of transported spin and/or orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of single-electron regime of quantum dots and definition of virtual gates using U-Net and clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize practical quantum computers, a large number of quantum bits (qubits) will be required. Semiconductor spin qubits offer advantages such as high scalability and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. However, as the number of qubits increases, manual qubit tuning becomes infeasible, motivating automated tuning approaches. In this study, we use U-Net, a neural network method for object detection, to identify charge transition lines in experimental charge stability diagrams. The extracted charge transition lines are analyzed using the Hough transform to determine their positions and angles. Based on this analysis, we obtain the transformation matrix to virtual gates. Furthermore, we identify the single-electron regime by clustering the Hough transform outputs. We also show the single-electron regime within the virtual gate space. These sequential processes are performed automatically. This approach will advance automated control technologies for large-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Strain-tuning of spin anisotropy in single-layer phosphorene: insights from Elliott-Yafet and Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials and systems that exhibit persistent spin texture provide a platform for creating robust spin states that can be used in quantum computing, memory storage, and other advanced technological applications. In this paper we show that persistent spin-texture in single-layer phosphorene electrons close to the $\Gamma$ point, subjected to the finite perpendicular electric field, can be achieved by appropriately tuning the extrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength using the tensile strain of about $1.2\%$ in the zigzag direction. This is confirmed by detailed numerical investigations of the effects of strain on the intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit coupling, and by the effective spin-orbit Hamiltonian of phosphorene electrons and holes around the $\Gamma$ point, assuming the presence of the perpendicular electric field. Furthermore, the calculated spin relaxation rates due to the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism indicate a giant anisotropy of the in-plane spin, up to $10^5$, which is directly related to the discovered persistent spin texture of phosphorene electrons close to the $\Gamma$ point. %%%%%%%% We also show, that strain can reverse the anisotropy of spin mixing parameter $b^2$ connected to the Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism which dominates spin relaxation in phosphorene. We find the conditions under which Elliott-Yafet spin lifetime anisotropy can be largely enhanced due to synergy of spin mixing and g-factor anisotropy. %%%%%%%%%% Our results suggest that spin texture in phosphorene can be modulated by strain, enabling its potential usage in the field of spintronics.</description>

      <title>Two-quanta processes in coupled double-quantum-dot cavity systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a compound sample consisting from a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) system non-linearly coupled with a leaking single-mode micro-resonator is theoretically investigated. The focus is on the resonance condition when the transition frequency of the double quantum dot equals to the doubled resonator frequency, respectively, and the resulting interplay among the involved phonon or photon channels. As a result, the steady-state quantum dynamics of this complex non-linear system exhibits a variety of possible effects that have been demonstrated here. Particularly, we have found the relationship among the electrical current through the double quantum dot and the microwave field inside the resonator that is nonlinearly coupled to it, with a corresponding emphasizing on their critical behaviors. Additionally, the quantum correlations of the photon flux generated into the resonator mode vary from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics, leading to single-qubit lasing phenomena at microwave frequencies.</description>

      <title>Theory of Magnon Purcell Effect in Cavity Magnonic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic analysis of cavity effects on the decay dynamics of an open magnonic system. The Purcell effect on the magnon oscillator decay is thoroughly examined for both driven and non-driven scenarios. Analytical conditions are determined to distinguish between strong and weak coupling regimes, corresponding to oscillatory and pure decay behaviors respectively. Additionally, our theory also predicts the decay of the photon mode within the cavity-magnonic open system, demonstrating excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Our findings and methodologies can provide valuable insights for advancing research in cavity magnonic quantum control, quantum information processing, and the development of magnonic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bias voltage controlled inversions of tunneling magnetoresistance in van der Waals heterostructures Fe3GaTe2/hBN/Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the bias voltage controlled inversions of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in magnetic tunnel junctions composed of Fe3GaTe2 electrodes and hBN tunneling barrier, observed at room temperature. The polarity reversal of TMR occurs consistently at around 0.625 V across multiple devices and temperatures, highlighting the robustness of the effect. To understand this behavior, we developed a theoretical model incorporating spin-resolved density of states (DOS) at high energy levels. By adjusting the DOS weighting at different k points to account for misalignment between the crystal structure of electrodes in experimental devices, we improved agreement between experimental and theoretical inversion voltages. Our results provide valuable insight into the voltage-controlled spin injection and detection in two-dimensional magnetic tunnel junctions, with implications for the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin polarised quantised transport via one-dimensional nanowire-graphene contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene spintronics offers a promising route to achieve low power 2D electronics for next generation classical and quantum computation. As device length scales are reduced to the limit of the electron mean free path, the transport mechanism crosses over to the ballistic regime. However, ballistic transport has yet to be shown in a graphene spintronic device, a necessary step towards realising ballistic spintronics. Here, we report ballistic injection of spin polarised carriers via one-dimensional contacts between magnetic nanowires and a high mobility graphene channel. The nanowire-graphene interface defines an effective constriction that confines charge carriers over a length scale smaller than that of their mean free path. This is evidenced by the observation of quantised conductance through the contacts with no applied magnetic field and a transition into the quantum Hall regime with increasing field strength. These effects occur in the absence of any constriction in the graphene itself and occur across several devices with transmission probability in the range T = 0.08 - 0.30.</description>

      <title>Off-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy of high-optical quality single photon emitters in GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the relevance of excitation parameters on the emission from single-photon emitting defect centers in GaN. We investigate the absorption spectrum of different emitters by photoluminescence excitation technique at 10\,K. We report large spectral jumps (shifts up to 22\,meV) in the emitters' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The likelihood of such jumps is increased by the change in excitation energy. The shifts indicate a large built-in dipole moment of the defects and suggest a possibility to electrically tune their ZPL in a wide range. From the photoluminescence excitation studies, we observe that for majority of the emitters the absorption peaks exist between 2 and 2.55\,eV. The absorption peaks vary from emitter to emitter, and no universal absorption pattern is apparent. Finally, for selected emitters we observe significantly reduced spectral diffusion and instrument-limited linewidth of $138\,\mu eV$ (0.04\,nm).These findings show a new perspective for atomic defect GaN emitters as sources of coherent photons, shine new light on their energy level structure and show the possibility of tuning the ZPL, paving the way to fully harness their potential for applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Atomic-resolution structural and spectroscopic evidence for the synthetic realization of two-dimensional copper boride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first realization of borophene on Ag(111), two-dimensional (2D) boron nanomaterials have attracted significant interest due to their polymorphic diversity and potential for hosting solid-state quantum phenomena. Here, we use atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and field-emission resonance (FER) spectroscopy to elucidate the structure and properties of atomically thin boron phases grown on Cu(111). Specifically, FER spectroscopy reveals unique charge transfer and electronic states compared to the distinct borophene phases observed on silver, suggesting that the deposition of boron on copper can result in strong covalent bonding characteristic of a 2D copper boride. This conclusion is reinforced by detailed STM characterization of line defects that are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations for atomically thin Cu8B14. This evidence for 2D copper boride is likely to motivate future synthetic efforts aimed at expanding the relatively unexplored family of atomically thin metal boride materials.</description>

      <title>Towards optimization of the Josephson diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the Josephson diode effect in the junction of singlet superconductors separated by the Rashba system in the in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the applied current. The coupling energy of two superconductors is analytically calculated using a tunneling Hamiltonian with a one-dimensional model. It is found that the critical current is asymmetric with respect to the current and the magnetic field, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Depending on a distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the Josephson diode effect changes its magnitude and sign. The magnitude is inversely proportional to a band split caused by the spin-orbit interaction. Since $d$ is experimentally controllable, the Josephson diode effect can be optimized by tuning of $d$. Our theory develops a new guiding principle to design the Josephson diode device</description>

      <title>Bogolon mediated light absorption in multi-component BEC with $Z_2$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the light absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the light absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.</description>

      <title>Witnessing non-stationary and non-Markovian environments with a quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic field fluctuations, where non-stationary effects such as spin diffusion and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can characterize the statistical properties of noise sources, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that analytically predicts Ramsey decay curves under different noise regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated by measuring Ramsey decay for NV centers subject to injected noise of each type. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to unravel complex noise behaviors induced by nanoscale environments, shedding light on their physical origins and guiding the development of strategies to mitigate decoherence. This work deepens our understanding of noise dynamics at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for enhancing the performance and robustness of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Biorealistic response in a technology-compatible graphene synaptic transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial synapse is a key element of future brain-inspired neuromorphic computing systems implemented in hardware. This work presents a graphene synaptic transistor based on all-technology-compatible materials that exhibits highly tunable biorealistic behavior. It is shown that the device geometry and interface properties can be designed to maximize the memory window and minimize power consumption. The device exhibits a virtually continuous range of multiple conductance levels, similar to synaptic weighting, which is achieved by gradual injection/emission of electrons into the floating gate and interface traps under the influence of an external electric field. Similar to the biological synapse, the transistor has short-term intrinsic dynamics that affect the long-term state. The temporal injection/emission dynamics of an electronic synapse closely resemble those of its biological counterpart and is exploited to emulate biorealistic behavior using a number of synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation/depression, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, and others. Such a synaptic transistor can serve as a building block in hardware artificial networks for advanced information processing and storage.</description>

      <title>SimOS: A Python Framework for Simulations of Optically Addressable Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source simulation framework for optically detected magnetic resonance, developed in Python. The framework allows users to construct, manipulate, and evolve multipartite quantum systems that consist of spins and electronic levels. We provide an interface for efficient time-evolution in Lindblad form as well as a framework for facilitating simulation of spatial and generalized stochastic dynamics. Further, symbolic operator construction and propagation is supported for simple model systems making the framework also ideal for use in classroom instruction of magnetic resonance. Designed to be backend-agnostic, the library leverages existing Python libraries as computational backends. We introduce the most important functionality and illustrate the syntax on a series of examples. These include systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and photo-generated spin-correlated radical pairs for which our library offers system-specific sub-modules.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconductivity coexisting with the anomalous Hall effect in 1T'-WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides are a family of quasi-two-dimensional materials that display a high technological potential due to their wide range of electronic ground states, e.g., from superconducting to semiconducting, depending on the chemical composition, crystal structure, or electrostatic doping. Here, we unveil that by tuning a single parameter, the hydrostatic pressure P, a cascade of electronic phase transitions can be induced in the few-layer transition metal dichalcogenide 1T'-WS2, including superconducting, topological, and anomalous Hall effect phases. Specifically, as P increases, we observe a dual phase transition: the suppression of superconductivity with the concomitant emergence of an anomalous Hall effect at P=1.15 GPa. Remarkably, upon further increasing the pressure above 1.6 GPa, we uncover a reentrant superconducting state that emerges out of a state still exhibiting an anomalous Hall effect. This superconducting state shows a marked increase in superconducting anisotropy with respect to the phase observed at ambient pressure, suggesting a different superconducting state with a distinct pairing symmetry. Via first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the system concomitantly transitions into a strong topological phase with markedly different band orbital characters and Fermi surfaces contributing to the superconductivity. These findings position 1T'-WS2 as a unique, tunable superconductor, wherein superconductivity, anomalous transport, and band features can be tuned through the application of moderate pressures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall state in double layer systems at total filling factor $1/2$. Recent progresses in two-dimensional van der Waals materials made it possible to explore the regime with very small interlayer distance. Numerical calculations suggests interlayer phase coherence can develop between the layers such that the electrons may redistribute between them without changing the Hall response. It corresponds to spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry associated with the particle number difference in the layers. This state manifests itself as superfluid in counterflow measurement and has characteristic Hall response when current is passed through one layer and voltages in both layers are measured. As the interlayer distance increases, a phase transition into the Halperin 331 state occurs. We also discuss similar physics for bosonic systems with specially designed interactions.</description>

Abstract: We construct a general theoretical framework for describing curvature-induced spin-orbit interactions on the basis of group theory. Our theory can systematically determine the emergence of spin splitting in the band structure according to symmetry in the wavenumber space and the bending direction of the material. As illustrative examples, we derive the curvature-induced spin-orbit coupling for carbon and silicon nanotubes. Our theory offers a strategy for designing valley-contrasting spin-orbit coupled materials by tuning their curvatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Berry curvature dipole is well-known to cause Hall conductivity. This study expands on previous results to demonstrate how two- and three-dimensional materials react under a tilted magnetic field in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We show how the Hall effect has a quantum origin by deriving the general form of intrinsic and extrinsic currents in materials under a tilted magnetic field. Our focus is on determining the linear and nonlinear response of two-dimensional materials. We also demonstrate that as the result of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field a current resulted by both velocity and Berry curvature can occur in two-dimensional materials and topological crystalline insulators in second harmonic generation and ratchet responses. The findings of this research may provide insight into the transport characteristics of materials in the semi-classical regime and initiate a new chapter in linear and nonlinear Hall effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new style of fluxonium qubit, gatemonium, based on an all superconductorsemiconductor hybrid platform. The linear inductance is achieved using six hundred planar Al-InAs Josephson junctions (JJs) in series. By tuning the single junction with a gate voltage, we demonstrate electrostatic control of the effective Josephson energy, tuning the weight of the fictitious phase particle. One and two-tone spectroscopy of the gatemonium transitions further reveal details of the hybrid plasmon-fluxon spectrum. Accounting for the nonsinusoidal current-phase relation of the single junction, we fit the measured spectra to extract charging and inductive energies. We conduct time domain characterization of the plasmon modes in a second gatemonium device with different charging energy and JJ array inductance. We discuss future directions for this platform in gate voltage-tunable, high plasma frequency, enhanced impedance junction arrays, and enhanced coherence times for voltage tunable architectures.</description>

      <title>Lattice-guided growth of dense arrays of aligned transition metal dichalcogenide nanoribbons with high catalytic reactivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit unique properties and potential applications when reduced to one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons (NRs), owing to quantum confinement and high edge densities. However, effective growth methods for self-aligned TMD NRs are still lacking. We demonstrate a versatile approach for lattice-guided growth of dense, aligned MoS2 NR arrays via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on anisotropic sapphire substrates, without tailored surface steps. This method enables the synthesis of NRs with widths below 10 nm and longitudinal axis parallel to the zigzag direction, being also extensible to the growth of WS2 NRs and MoS2-WS2 hetero-nanoribbons. Growth is influenced by both substrate and CVD temperature, indicating the role of anisotropic precursor diffusion and substrate interaction. The 1D nature of the NRs was asserted by the observation of Coulomb blockade at low temperature. Pronounced catalytic activity was observed at the edges of the NRs, indicating their promise for efficient catalysis.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile source of single photons with tunable properties to be used in quantum-cryptographic applications. A crucial figure of merit of the emitted photons is photon number coherence (PNC), which impacts the security of many quantum communication protocols. In the process of single-photon generation, the quantum dot as a solid-state object is subject to an interaction with phonons, which can therefore indirectly affect the PNC. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of PNC in optically excited quantum dots and how it is affected by phonons. In contrast to the expectation that phonons always deteriorate coherence, PNC can be increased in a quantum dot-cavity system due to the electron-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.</description>

Abstract: While intense laser irradiation and moir\'e engineering have independently proven powerful for tuning material properties on demand in condensed matter physics, their combination remains unexplored. Here we exploit tilted laser illumination to create spatially modulated light-matter interactions, leading to two striking phenomena in graphene. First, using two lasers tilted along the same axis, we create a quasi-1D supercell hosting a network of Floquet topological states that generate controllable and scalable photocurrents spanning the entire irradiated region. Second, by tilting lasers along orthogonal axes, we establish a 2D polarization moir\'e pattern giving rise to closed orbital propagation of Floquet states, reminiscent of bulk Landau states. These features, imprinted in the bulk of the irradiated region and controlled through laser wavelength and tilt angles, establish a new way for engineering quantum states through spatially modulated light-matter coupling.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic Weyl semimetals (WSM) have recently attracted much attention due to their potential in realizing strong anomalous Hall effects. Yet, how to design such systems remains unclear. Based on first-principles calculations, we show here that the ferromagnetic half-metallic compound In$_2$CoSe$_4$ has several pairs of Weyl points and is hence a good candidate for magnetic WSM. These Weyl points would approach the Fermi level gradually as the Hubbard $U$ increases, and finally disappear after a critical value $U_c$. The range of the Hubbard $U$ that can realize the magnetic WSM state can be expanded by pressure, manifesting the practical utility of the present prediction. Moreover, by generating two surface terminations at Co or In atom after cleaving the compound at the Co-Se bonds, the nontrivial Fermi arcs connecting one pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality are discovered in surface states. Furthermore, it is possible to observe the nontrivial surface state experimentally, e.g., angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. As such, the present findings imply strongly a new magnetic WSM which may host a large anomalous Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions</title>

Abstract: Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned design principles for enhanced red emission from nitride quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted toward mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as they are viewed as detrimental to light emission, albeit with limited success for red emission. Here, we show that such fields can unusually enhance the optical oscillator strength of red-emitting nitride quantum wells. This insight is enabled by machine-learned models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, allowing for a global exploration of the quantum-well design space at greatly reduced computational cost. Larger polarization fields correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission, a consequence of the quantum-confined Stark effect enabling thinner quantum wells. This finding has implications for designing efficient red nitride LEDs, which are crucial for miniaturizing polychromatic LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. More broadly, this work highlights the power of machine learning in accelerating the discovery of unconventional paradigms for semiconductor design.</description>

      <title>Deterministic printing and heterointegration of single colloidal quantum dot photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04177</link>

Abstract: Single nanoparticles are essential building blocks for next-generation quantum photonic technologies, however, scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies have remained largely out of reach. Here, we present a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model that exploits nanoscale dielectrophoretics to precisely print single colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with accuracies allowing for fully-additive nanoscale photonics integration. Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.</description>
