      <title>Metamathematics of Resolution Lower Bounds: A TFNP Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the *refuter* problems, a family of decision-tree $\mathsf{TFNP}$ problems capturing the metamathematical difficulty of proving proof complexity lower bounds. Suppose $\varphi$ is a hard tautology that does not admit any length-$s$ proof in some proof system $P$. In the corresponding refuter problem, we are given (query access to) a purported length-$s$ proof $\pi$ in $P$ that claims to have proved $\varphi$, and our goal is to find an invalid derivation inside $\pi$. As suggested by witnessing theorems in bounded arithmetic, the *computational complexity* of these refuter problems is closely tied to the *metamathematics* of the underlying proof complexity lower bounds.
  We focus on refuter problems corresponding to lower bounds for *resolution*, which is arguably the single most studied system in proof complexity. We introduce a new class $\mathrm{rwPHP}(\mathsf{PLS})$ in decision-tree $\mathsf{TFNP}$, which can be seen as a randomized version of $\mathsf{PLS}$, and argue that this class effectively captures the metamathematics of proving resolution lower bounds.
  We view these results as a contribution to the *bounded reverse mathematics* of complexity lower bounds: when interpreted in relativized bounded arithmetic, our results show that the theory $\mathsf{T}^1_2(\alpha) + \mathrm{dwPHP}(\mathsf{PV}(\alpha))$ characterizes the "reasoning power" required to prove (the "easiest") resolution lower bounds. An intriguing corollary of our results is that the combinatorial principle, "the pigeonhole principle requires exponential-size resolution proofs", captures the class of $\mathsf{TFNP}$ problems whose totality is provable in $\mathsf{T}^1_2 + \mathrm{dwPHP}(\mathsf{PV})$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic tensor rank is characterized by polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic tensor rank is notoriously difficult to determine. Indeed, determining its value for the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor would determine the matrix multiplication exponent, a long-standing open problem. On the other hand, Strassen's asymptotic rank conjecture makes the bold claim that asymptotic tensor rank equals the largest dimension of the tensor and is thus as easy to compute as matrix rank. Despite tremendous interest, much is still unknown about the structural and computational properties of asymptotic rank; for instance whether it is computable.
  We prove that asymptotic tensor rank is "computable from above", that is, for any real number $r$ there is an (efficient) algorithm that determines, given a tensor $T$, if the asymptotic tensor rank of $T$ is at most $r$. The algorithm has a simple structure; it consists of evaluating a finite list of polynomials on the tensor. Indeed, we prove that the sublevel sets of asymptotic rank are Zariski-closed (just like matrix rank). While we do not exhibit these polynomials explicitly, their mere existence has strong implications on the structure of asymptotic rank.
  As one such implication, we find that the values that asymptotic tensor rank takes, on all tensors, is a well-ordered set. In other words, any non-increasing sequence of asymptotic ranks stabilizes ("discreteness from above"). In particular, for the matrix multiplication exponent (which is an asymptotic rank) there is no sequence of exponents of bilinear maps that approximates it arbitrarily closely from above without being eventually constant. In other words, any upper bound on the matrix multiplication exponent that is close enough, will "snap" to it. Previously such discreteness results were only known for finite fields or for other tensor parameters (e.g., asymptotic slice rank). We obtain them for infinite fields like the complex numbers.</description>

      <title>Pathways to Tractability for Geometric Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical problem of computing geometric thickness, i.e., finding a straight-line drawing of an input graph and a partition of its edges into as few parts as possible so that each part is crossing-free. Since the problem is NP-hard, we investigate its tractability through the lens of parameterized complexity. As our first set of contributions, we provide two fixed-parameter algorithms which utilize well-studied parameters of the input graph, notably the vertex cover and feedback edge numbers. Since parameterizing by the thickness itself does not yield tractability and the use of other structural parameters remains open due to general challenges identified in previous works, as our second set of contributions, we propose a different pathway to tractability for the problem: extension of partial solutions. In particular, we establish a full characterization of the problem's parameterized complexity in the extension setting depending on whether we parameterize by the number of missing vertices, edges, or both.</description>

      <title>Coherence in Property Testing: Quantum-Classical Collapses and Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the power and limitations of classical and quantum information and how they differ is a fundamental endeavor. In property testing of distributions, a tester is given samples over a typically large domain $\{0,1\}^n$. An important property is the support size both of distributions [Valiant and Valiant, STOC'11], as well, as of quantum states. Classically, even given $2^{n/16}$ samples, no tester can distinguish distributions of support size $2^{n/8}$ from $2^{n/4}$ with probability better than $2^{-\Theta(n)}$, even promised they are flat.
  Quantum states can be in a coherent superposition of states of $\{0,1\}^n$, so one may ask if coherence can enhance property testing. Flat distributions naturally correspond to subset states, $|\phi_S \rangle=1/\sqrt{|S|}\sum_{i\in S}|i\rangle$. We show that coherence alone is not enough, Coherence limitations: Given $2^{n/16}$ copies, no tester can distinguish subset states of size $2^{n/8}$ from $2^{n/4}$ with probability better than $2^{-\Theta(n)}$.
  The hardness persists even with multiple public-coin AM provers, Classical hardness with provers: Given $2^{O(n)}$ samples from a distribution and $2^{O(n)}$ communication with AM provers, no tester can estimate the support size up to factors $2^{\Omega(n)}$ with probability better than $2^{-\Theta(n)}$. Our result is tight.
  In contrast, coherent subset state proofs suffice to improve testability exponentially, Quantum advantage with certificates: With poly-many copies and subset state proofs, a tester can approximate the support size of a subset state of arbitrary size.
  Some structural assumption on the quantum proofs is required since we show, Collapse of QMA: A general proof cannot improve testability of any quantum property whatsoever.
  We also show connections to disentangler and quantum-to-quantum transformation lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Ordering groups and the Identity Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Identity Problem for certain groups, which asks if the subsemigroup generated by a given finite set of elements contains the identity element, is related to problems regarding ordered groups. Notably, the Identity Problem for a torsion-free nilpotent group corresponds to the problem asking if a given finite set of elements extends to the positive cone of a left-order on the group, and thereby also to the Word Problem for a related lattice-ordered group.
  A new (independent) proof is given showing that the Identity and Subgroup Problems are decidable for every finitely presented nilpotent group, establishing also the decidability of the Word Problem for a family of lattice-ordered groups. A related problem, the Fixed-Target Submonoid Membership Problem, is shown to be undecidable in nilpotent groups.
  Decidability of the Normal Identity Problem (with `subsemigroup' replaced by `normal subsemigroup') for free nilpotent groups is established using the (known) decidability of the Word Problem for certain lattice-ordered groups. Connections between orderability and the Identity Problem for a class of torsion-free metabelian groups are also explored.</description>

      <title>Algorithmics and Complexity of Cost-Driven Task Offloading with Submodular Optimization in Edge-Cloud Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging applications such as autonomous driving pose the challenge of efficient cost-driven offloading in edge-cloud environments. This involves assigning tasks to edge and cloud servers for separate execution, with the goal of minimizing the total service cost including communication and computation costs. In this paper, observing that the intra-cloud communication costs are relatively low and can often be neglected in many real-world applications, we consequently introduce the so-called communication assumption which posits that the intra-cloud communication costs are not higher than the inter-partition communication cost between cloud and edge servers, nor the cost among edge servers. As a preliminary analysis, we first prove that the offloading problem without the communication assumption is NP-hard, using a reduction from MAX-CUT. Then, we show that the offloading problem can be modeled as a submodular minimization problem, making it polynomially solvable. Moreover, this polynomial solvability remains even when additional constraints are imposed, such as when certain tasks must be executed on edge servers due to latency constraints. By combining both algorithmics and computational complexity results, we demonstrate that the difficulty of the offloading problem largely depends on whether the communication assumption is satisfied. Lastly, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the practical performance of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its significant advantages over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the equational theory of Kleene algebra with commutativity
  conditions on primitives (or atomic terms) is undecidable, thereby settling a
  longstanding open question in the theory of Kleene algebra. While this

      <description>arXiv:2411.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study approximation algorithms for the forest cover and bounded forest cover problems. A probabilistic $2+\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for the forest cover problem is given using the method of dual fitting. A deterministic algorithm with a 2-approximation ratio that rounds the optimal solution to a linear program is given next. The 2-approximation for the forest cover is then used to give a 6-approximation for the bounded forest cover problem. The use of the probabilistic method to develop the $2+\epsilon$ approximation algorithm may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Constant Inapproximability for PPA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $\varepsilon$-Consensus-Halving problem, we are given $n$ probability measures $v_1, \dots, v_n$ on the interval $R = [0,1]$, and the goal is to partition $R$ into two parts $R^+$ and $R^-$ using at most $n$ cuts, so that $|v_i(R^+) - v_i(R^-)| \leq \varepsilon$ for all $i$. This fundamental fair division problem was the first natural problem shown to be complete for the class PPA, and all subsequent PPA-completeness results for other natural problems have been obtained by reducing from it.
  We show that $\varepsilon$-Consensus-Halving is PPA-complete even when the parameter $\varepsilon$ is a constant. In fact, we prove that this holds for any constant $\varepsilon &lt; 1/5$. As a result, we obtain constant inapproximability results for all known natural PPA-complete problems, including Necklace-Splitting, the Discrete-Ham-Sandwich problem, two variants of the pizza sharing problem, and for finding fair independent sets in cycles and paths.</description>

      <title>On guarded extensions of MMSNP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feder and Vardi showed that the class Monotone Monadic SNP without inequality (MMSNP) has a P vs NP-complete dichotomy if and only if such a dichotomy holds for finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems. Moreover, they showed that none of the three classes obtained by removing one of the defining properties of MMSNP (monotonicity, monadicity, no inequality) has a dichotomy. The overall objective of this paper is to study the gaps between MMSNP and each of these three superclasses, where the existence of a dichotomy remains unknown. For the gap between MMSNP and Monotone SNP without inequality, we study the class Guarded Monotone SNP without inequality (GMSNP) introduced by Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, and prove that GMSNP has a dichotomy if and only if a dichotomy holds for GMSNP problems over signatures consisting of a unique relation symbol. For the gap between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality, we have two contributions. We introduce a new class MMSNP with guarded inequality, that lies between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality and that is strictly more expressive than the former and still has a dichotomy. Apart from that, we give a detailed proof that every problem in NP is polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in MMSNP with inequality, which implies the absence of a dichotomy for the latter. For the gap between MMSNP and Monadic SNP without inequality, we introduce a logic that extends the class of Matrix Partitions in a similar way how MMSNP extends CSP, and pose an open question about the existence of a dichotomy for this class.</description>

      <title>Optimal Proof Systems for Complex Sets are Hard to Find</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first evidence for the inherent difficulty of finding complex sets with optimal proof systems. For this, we construct oracles $O_1$ and $O_2$ with the following properties, where $\mathrm{RE}$ denotes the class of recursively enumerable sets and $\mathrm{NQP}$ the class of sets accepted in non-deterministic quasi-polynomial time.
  - $O_1$: no set in $\mathrm{PSPACE} \setminus \mathrm{NP}$ has optimal proof systems and $\mathrm{PH}$ is infinite
  - $O_2$: no set in $\mathrm{RE} \setminus \mathrm{NQP}$ has optimal proof systems and $\mathrm{NP} \neq \mathrm{coNP}$
  Oracle $O_2$ is the first relative to which complex sets with optimal proof systems do not exist. By oracle $O_1$, no relativizable proof can show that there exist sets in $\mathrm{PSPACE} \setminus \mathrm{NP}$ with optimal proof systems, even when assuming an infinite $\mathrm{PH}$. By oracle $O_2$, no relativizable proof can show that there exist sets outside $\mathrm{NQP}$ with optimal proof systems, even when assuming $\mathrm{NP} \neq \mathrm{coNP}$. This explains the difficulty of the following longstanding open questions raised by Kraj\'i\v{c}ek, Pudl\'ak, Sadowski, K\"obler, and Messner [KP89, Sad97, KM98, Mes00].
  - Q1: Are there sets outside $\mathrm{NP}$ with optimal proof systems?
  - Q2: Are there arbitrarily complex sets outside $\mathrm{NP}$ with optimal proof systems?
  Moreover, relative to $O_2$, there exist arbitrarily complex sets $L \notin \mathrm{NQP}$ having almost optimal algorithms, but none of them has optimal proof systems. This explains the difficulty of Messner's approach [Mes99] to translate almost optimal algorithms into optimal proof systems.</description>

      <title>An order out of nowhere: a new algorithm for infinite-domain CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of satisfiability of sets of constraints in a given set of finite uniform hypergraphs. While the problem under consideration is similar in nature to the problem of satisfiability of constraints in graphs, the classical complexity reduction to finite-domain CSPs that was used in the proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems cannot be used as a black box in our case. We therefore introduce an algorithmic technique inspired by classical notions from the theory of finite-domain CSPs, and prove its correctness based on symmetries that depend on a linear order that is external to the structures under consideration. Our second main result is a P/NP-complete complexity dichotomy for such problems over many sets of uniform hypergraphs. The proof is based on the translation of the problem into the framework of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over infinite uniform hypergraphs. Our result confirms in particular the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture for CSPs of first-order reducts of some homogeneous hypergraphs. This forms a vast generalization of previous work by Bodirsky-Pinsker (STOC'11) and Bodirsky-Martin-Pinsker-Pongr\'acz (ICALP'16) on graph satisfiability.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Quotient Polynomials with Applications to Exact Divisibility and Divisibility Testing of Sparse Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for monic polynomials $f, g \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ such that $g$ divides $f$, the $\ell_2$-norm of the quotient polynomial $f/g$ is bounded by $\lVert f \rVert_1 \cdot \tilde{O}(\lVert{g}\rVert_0^3\text{deg}^2{ f})^{\lVert{g}\rVert_0 - 1}$. This improves upon the previously known exponential (in $\text{deg}{ f}$) bounds for general polynomials. Our results implies that the trivial long division algorithm runs in quasi-linear time relative to the input size and number of terms of the quotient polynomial $f/g$, thus solving a long-standing problem on exact divisibility of sparse polynomials.
  We also study the problem of bounding the number of terms of $f/g$ in some special cases. When $f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $g$ is a cyclotomic-free (i.e., it has no cyclotomic factors) trinomial, we prove that $\lVert{f/g}\rVert_0 \leq O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 \text{size}({f})^2 \cdot \log^6{\text{deg}{ g}})$. When $g$ is a cyclotomic-free binomial, we prove that the sparsity is at most $O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 ( \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_0} + \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_{\infty}}))$. Both upper bounds are polynomial in the input-size. We leverage these results and give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a cyclotomic-free trinomial divides a sparse polynomial over the integers.
  As our last result, we present a polynomial time algorithm for testing divisibility by pentanomials over small finite fields when $\text{deg}{ f} = \tilde{O}(\text{deg}{ g})$.</description>

      <title>Noise-tolerant learnability of shallow quantum circuits from statistics and the cost of quantum pseudorandomness</title>

Abstract: This work studies the learnability of quantum circuits in the near term. We show the natural robustness of quantum statistical queries for learning quantum processes and provide an efficient way to benchmark global depolarizing noise from statistics, which gives us a powerful framework for developing noise-tolerant algorithms. We adapt a learning algorithm for constant-depth quantum circuits to the quantum statistical query setting with a small overhead in the query complexity. We prove average-case lower bounds for learning random quantum circuits of logarithmic and higher depths within diamond distance with statistical queries. Finally, we prove that pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) cannot be constructed using circuits of constant depth by constructing an efficient distinguisher and proving a new variation of the quantum no-free lunch theorem.</description>

      <title>On classical advice, sampling advise and complexity assumptions for learning separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between sampling advice, i.e., advice in the form of a training set, and classical advice. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that BPP/samp is equal to P/poly. Additionally, we delve into the analysis of these relationships under the constraint of a fixed distribution. Notably, we show that under such circumstances, the equality does not hold. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights gained from these proofs, we identify sufficient and necessary complexity assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up in the worst-case scenario, i.e., when accurate results are required for all inputs.</description>

      <title>QMA vs. QCMA and Pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a longstanding question of Aaronson and Kuperberg on whether there exists a classical oracle separating $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$. Settling this question in either direction would yield insight into the power of quantum proofs over classical proofs. We show that such an oracle exists if a certain quantum pseudorandomness conjecture holds. Roughly speaking, the conjecture posits that quantum algorithms cannot, by making few queries, distinguish between the uniform distribution over permutations versus permutations drawn from so-called "dense" distributions.
  Our result can be viewed as establishing a "win-win" scenario: either there is a classical oracle separation of $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$, or there is quantum advantage in distinguishing pseudorandom distributions on permutations.</description>
