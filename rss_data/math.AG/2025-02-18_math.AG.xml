      <title>Optimal Bounds for the Number of Pieces of Near-Circuit Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $f$ is a polynomial in $n$ variables with real coefficients, exactly $n+k$ monomial terms, and Newton polytope of positive volume. Estimating the number of connected components of the positive zero set of $f$ is a fundamental problem in real algebraic geometry, with applications in computational complexity and topology. We prove that the number of connected components is at most $3$ when $k\!=\!3$, settling an open question from Fewnomial Theory. Our results also extend to exponential sums with real exponents. A key contribution here is a deeper analysis of the underlying $\mathcal{A}$-discriminant curves, which should be of use for other quantitative geometric problems.</description>

      <title>A Tate algebra version of the Jacobian Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Tate algebra version of the Jacobian conjecture, referred to as the Tate-Jacobian conjecture, for commutative rings $R$ equipped with an $I$-adic topology. We show that if the $I$-adic topology on $R$ is Hausdorff and $R/I$ is a subring of a $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra, then the Tate-Jacobian conjecture is equivalent to the Jacobian conjecture. Conversely, if $R/I$ has positive characteristic, the Tate-Jacobian conjecture fails. Furthermore, we establish that the Jacobian conjecture for $\mathbb{C}$ is equivalent to the following statement: for all but finitely many primes $p$, the inverse of a polynomial map over $\mathbb{C}_p$ whose Jacobian determinant is an element of $\mathbb{C}_p^\times$ lies in the Tate algebra over $\mathbb{C}_p$.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry from families of Calabi-Yau manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report interesting examples of Calabi-Yau threefolds where birational geometry and geometry of Fourier-Mukai partners of a Calabi-Yau manifold arise naturally from studying its mirror family of Calabi-Yau manifolds. We define mirror symmetry in terms of families of Calabi-Yau manifolds in general. We will find for our examples that all expected geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds arises from special boundary points, called LCSL points, in the parameter space of mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds.</description>

      <title>The automorphism group of an Ap\'ery-Fermi K3 surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Ap\'ery-Fermi K3 surface is a complex K3 surface of Picard number 19 that is birational to a general member of a certain one-dimensional family of affine surfaces related to the Fermi surface in solid-state physics. This K3 surface is also linked to a recurrence relation that appears in the famous proof of the irrationality of zeta(3) by Ap\'ery. We compute the automorphism group Aut(X) of the Ap\'ery-Fermi K3 surface X using Borcherds' method. We describe Aut(X) in terms of generators and relations. Moreover, we determine the action of Aut(X) on the set of ADE-configurations of smooth rational curves on X for some ADE-types. In particular, we show that Aut(X) acts transitively on the set of smooth rational curves, and that it partitions the set of pairs of disjoint smooth rational curves into two orbits.</description>

      <title>Estimates for Betti numbers and relative Hermite-Minkowski theorem for perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove estimates for the Betti numbers of constructible sheaves in characteristic p&gt;0 depending only on their rank, stratification and wild ramification. In particular, given a smooth proper variety of dimension n over an algebraically closed field and a divisor D of X, for every $0\leq i \leq n$, there is a polynomial $P_i$ of degree $\max \{i,2n-i\}$ such that the i-th Betti number of any rank r local system L on X-D is smaller than $P_i(lc_D(L))\cdot r$ where $lc_D(L)$ is the highest logarithmic conductor of L at the generic points of D. As application, we show that the Betti numbers of the inverse and higher direct images of a local system are controlled by the rank and the highest logarithmic conductor. We also reprove Deligne's finiteness for simple $\ell$-adic local systems with bounded rank and ramification on a smooth variety over a finite field and extend it in two different directions. In particular, perverse sheaves over arbitrary singular schemes are allowed and the bounds we obtain are uniform in algebraic families and do not depend on $\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a semi-continuity property for both conductor divisors and logarithmic conductor divisors for \'etale sheaves on higher relative dimensions in a geometric situation. It generalizes a semi-continuity result for conductors of \'etale sheaves on relative curves to higher relative dimensions, and it can be considered as a higher dimensional $\ell$-adic analogy of Andr\'e's result on the semi-continuity of Poincar\'e-Katz ranks of meromorphic connections on smooth relative curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explain four viewpoints on the local tropicalization of formal subgerms of toric germs, which is a local analog of the global tropicalization of subvarieties of algebraic tori. We start by illustrating some of those viewpoints for plane curve singularities, then we pass to arbitrary dimensions. We conclude by describing several variants and extensions of the notion of local tropicalization presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties analogs of two results about algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize decomposable principally polarized abelian varieties of the form $E\times B$, with $E$ an elliptic curve, in two different ways. The first one is by the non-surjectivity of a certain multiplication map of global sections, i.e. by the non-vanishing of a certain $0$-th Koszul cohomology group. The second one is by the non-surjectivity of a certain second order gaussian map. Both results are analogous to well known characterizations of hyperelliptic curves among all smooth curves of given genus. We also show that, according to previous work of the first author, the second characterization can be seen as an effective version of a theorem of Nakamaye characterizing the above decomposable abelian varieties as those of minimal Seshadri constant.</description>

      <title>Curves on Compact Arithmetic Quotients of Hyperbolic 2-ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the simplest type of compact arithmetic quotients of the hyperbolic 2-ball $\mathbb{B}^2$, which has a moduli interpretation for certain types of abelian varieties of dimension 6 with $\mathcal{O}_F$-endomorphism, where $F$ is a CM extension of a real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$. Under mild assumption, we prove that for any fixed $g$, when the defining discriminant $D$ is large, there will be no complex curves of genus $g$ on this type of arithmetic quotients. The proof uses the technique of volume estimates, which requires us to understand the distribution of special subvarieties and the geometry near quotient and cusp singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the formalism of Cox rings and universal torsors, we prove a decomposition of the Grothendieck motive of the moduli space of morphisms from an arbitrary smooth projective curve to a Mori Dream Space (MDS).
  For the simplest cases of MDS, that of toric varieties, we use this decomposition to prove an instance of the motivic Batyrev--Manin--Peyre principle for curves satisfying tangency conditions with respect to the boundary divisors, often called Campana curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the minimal log discrepancy of any isolated Fano cone singularity is at most the dimension of the variety. This is based on its relation with dimensions of moduli spaces of orbifold rational curves. We also propose a conjectural characterization of weighted projective spaces as Fano orbifolds in terms of orbifold rational curves, which would imply the equality holds only for smooth points.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons invariants of hyperbolic three-manifolds, mixed Tate motives, and motivic path torsor of augmented character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any complete hyperbolic three-manifold of finite volume, we construct a mixed Tate motive defined over the invariant trace field whose image under Beilinson regulator equals the PSL2(C)-Chern-Simons invariant, thus equals the complex volume of the manifold, up to constant. Further, we show that when M has single torus boundary, under some assumption on asymptotic behaviour of the Chern-Simons invariant near an ideal point, its Hodge realization is a quotient of the mixed Hodge structure on the path torsor of the smooth locus of the canonical curve component of the augmented character variety of the three-manifold between a geometric point (giving the complete hyperbolic structure) and some tangential base point at an ideal point whose existence is asserted by the assumption. We explain its motivic implication. In the appendix, we verify some cases of the assumption. The theory developed here is parallel to the motivic theory of polylogarithms.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p &gt; 0$. For a strictly semi-stable scheme over $k[[t]]$, we construct the weight spectral sequence in $p$-adic cohomology using the theory of arithmetic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, whose $E_1$ terms are described by rigid cohomologies of irreducible components of the closed fiber and whose $E_\infty$ terms are conjecturally described by the (unipotent) nearby cycle of Lazda-P\'{a}l's rigid cohomology over the bounded Robba ring. We also show its functoriality by pushforward and state the conjecture of its functoriality by pullback and dual.</description>

Abstract: It was first shown in (Catanese-LeBrun 1997) that certain high-dimensional smooth closed manifolds admit pairs of Einstein metrics with Ricci curvatures of opposite sign. After reviewing subsequent progress that has been made on this topic, we then prove various related results, with the ultimate goal of stimulating further research on associated questions.</description>

      <title>On a specialization of Toda eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies rational functions $\mathfrak{J}_\alpha(q)$, which depend on a positive element $\alpha$ of the root lattice of a root system. These functions arise as Shapovalov pairings of Whittaker vectors in Verma modules of highest weight $-\rho$ for quantum groups and as Hilbert series of Zastava spaces, and are related to the Toda system. They are specializations of multivariate functions more commonly studied in the literature. We investigate the denominator of these rational functions and give an explicit combinatorial formula for the numerator in type A.</description>

      <title>Exploring information geometry: Recent Advances and Connections to Topological Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This introductory text arises from a lecture given in G\"oteborg, Sweden, given by the first author and is intended for undergraduate students, as well as for any mathematically inclined reader wishing to explore a synthesis of ideas connecting geometry and statistics. At its core, this work seeks to illustrate the profound and yet natural interplay between differential geometry, probability theory, and the rich algebraic structures encoded in (pre-)Frobenius manifolds.
  The exposition is structured into three principal parts. The first part provides a concise introduction to differential topology and geometry, emphasizing the role of smooth manifolds, connections, and curvature in the formulation of geometric structures. The second part is devoted to probability, measures, and statistics, where the notion of a probability space is refined into a geometric object, thus paving the way for a deeper mathematical understanding of statistical models. Finally, in the third part, we introduce (pre-)Frobenius manifolds, revealing their surprising connection to exponential families of probability distributions and, discuss more broadly, their role in the geometry of information. At the end of those three parts the reader will find stimulating exercises.
  By bringing together these seemingly distant disciplines, we aim to highlight the natural emergence of geometric structures in statistical theory. This work does not seek to be exhaustive but rather to provide the reader with a pathway into a domain of mathematics that is still in its formative stages, where many fundamental questions remain open. The text is accessible without requiring advanced prerequisites and should serve as an invitation to further exploration.</description>

      <title>Hyperelliptic curves, minitwistors, and spacelike Zoll spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a compact minitwistor space from a hyperelliptic curve with real structure and show that it yields a lot of new Lorentzian Einstein-Weyl spaces all of which are diffeomorphic to the 3-dimensional deSitter space. These structures are real analytic, admit a circle symmetry and moreover, all their spacelike geodesics are closed and simple. The number of the nodes of minitwistor lines on the minitwistor space is equal to the genus of the hyperelliptic curve and is taken arbitrarily. These Einstein-Weyl structures deform as the hyperelliptic curves deform, and so have $(2g-1)$-dimensional moduli space, where $g$ is the genus of the hyperelliptic curve. A relationship between the minitwistor spaces recently obtained by Hitchin from ALE gravitational instantons is also given for A$_{\rm odd}$-type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realise the Bott-Samelson resolutions of type A Schubert varieties as quiver Grassmannians. In order to explicitly describe this isomorphism, we introduce the notion of a \textit{geometrically compatible} decomposition for any permutation in $S_n$. For smooth type A Schubert varieties, we identify a suitable dimension vector such that the corresponding quiver Grassmannian is isomorphic to the Schubert variety. To obtain these isomorphisms, we construct a special quiver with relations and investigate two classes of quiver Grassmannians for this quiver.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Jordan-H\"older property fails for polarizable semiorthogonal decompositions -- those where every factor admits a Bridgeland stability condition. Counterexamples exist among Fukaya categories of surfaces and bounded derived categories of smooth projective varieties. Furthermore, we give an example of a smooth and proper pre-triangulated dg category with positive rank Grothendieck group which does not admit a stability condition.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be an algebraically closed, complete, non-Archimedean valued field of characteristic zero. We prove the non-Archimedean Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture for projective surfaces of irregularity one. More precisely, we prove that if $X/K$ is a groupless, projective surface that admits a dominant morphism an elliptic curve, then $X$ is $K$-analytically Brody hyperbolic. The main ingredient in our proof is a theorem concerning the algebraic degeneracy of non-Archimedean entire curves in projective, pseudo-groupless varieties admitting a dominant morphism to an elliptic curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An arc space of an affine cone over a projective toric variety is known to be non-reduced in general. It was demonstrated recently that the reduced scheme structure is worth studying due to various connections with representation theory and combinatorics. In this paper we develop a general machinery for the description of the reduced arc spaces of affine cones over toric varieties. We apply our techniques to a number of classical cases and explore some connections with representation theory of current algebras.</description>

Abstract: We confirm the quasi-projective case of Saito's conjecture, namely that the cohomological characteristic classes defined by Abbes and Saito can be computed in terms of the characteristic cycles.
  We construct a cohomological characteristic class supported on the non-acyclicity locus of a separated morphism relatively to a constructible sheaf. As applications of the functorial properties of this class, we prove cohomological analogs of the Milnor formula and the conductor formula for constructible sheaves on (not necessarily smooth) varieties.</description>

      <title>Fibrations by plane quartic curves with a canonical moving singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08579v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify fibrations by integral plane projective rational quartic curves whose generic fibre is regular but admits a non-smooth point that is a canonical divisor. These fibrations can only exist in characteristic two. The geometric generic fibre, which determines the generic behaviour of the special fibres, is an integral plane projective rational quartic curve over the algebraic closure of the function field of the base. It has the remarkable property that the tangent lines at the non-singular points are either all bitangents or all non-ordinary inflection tangents; moreover it is strange, that is, all the tangent lines meet in a common point. We construct two fibrations that are universal in the sense that any other fibration with the aforementioned properties can be obtained from one of them by a base extension. Furthermore, among these fibrations we choose a pencil of plane quartic curves and study in detail its geometry. We determine the corresponding minimal regular model and we describe it as a purely inseparable double covering of a quasi-elliptic fibration.</description>

      <title>Perverse filtrations and Fourier transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction between Fourier-Mukai transforms and perverse filtrations for a certain class of dualizable abelian fibrations. Multiplicativity of the perverse filtration and the "Perverse $\supset$ Chern" phenomenon for these abelian fibrations are immediate consequences of our theory. We also show that our class of fibrations include families of compactified Jacobians of integral locally planar curves.
  Applications include the following: (a) we prove the motivic decomposition conjecture for this class (including compactified Jacobian fibrations), which generalizes Deninger-Murre's theorem for abelian schemes; (b) we provide a new proof of the P=W conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_r$; (c) we prove half of the P=C conjecture concerning refined BPS invariants for the local $\mathbb{P}^2$; (d) we show that the perverse filtration for the compactified Jacobian associated with an integral locally planar curve is multiplicative, which generalizes a result of Oblomkov-Yun for homogeneous singularities.
  Our techniques combine Arinkin's autoduality for coherent categories, Ng\^o's support theorem for the decomposition theorem, Adams operations in operational K-theory, and Corti-Hanamura's theory of relative Chow motives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the "natural" locus of definition of Abel-Jacobi maps. In particular, we show that, for a proper, geometrically reduced curve C -- not necessarily smooth -- the Abel-Jacobi map from the smooth locus C^{sm} into the Jacobian of C does not extend to any larger (separated, geometrically reduced) curve containing C^{sm} except under certain particular circumstances which we describe explicitly. As a consequence, we deduce that the Abel-Jacobi map has closed image except in certain explicitly described circumstances, and that it is always a closed embedding for irreducible curves not isomorphic to P^1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve, $E$ a locally free sheaf. Hyperquot schemes on $C$ parametrise flags of coherent quotients of $E$ with fixed Hilbert polynomial, and offer alternative compactifications to the spaces of maps from $C$ to partial flag varieties. Motivated by enumerative geometry, in this paper we construct a perfect obstruction theory (and hence a virtual class and a virtual structure sheaf) on these moduli spaces, which we use to provide criteria for smoothness and unobstructedness. Under these assumptions, we determine their motivic partition function in the Grothendieck ring of varieties, in terms of the motivic zeta function of $C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general method for constructing moduli stacks whose points are diagrams of vector bundles over a fixed base, indexed by a fixed simplicial set -- that is, quiver bundles of a fixed shape. We discuss some constraints on the base for these moduli stacks to be Artin and observe that a large class of interesting schemes satisfy these constraints. Using this construction, we recover Nakajima quiver varieties and provide an alternate construction for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles along with a proof of algebraicity following readily from the algebraicity of moduli stacks of quiver bundles. One feature of our approach is that, for each of the moduli stacks we discuss, there are moduli stacks that are Artin, parametrizing morphisms of the objects being classified. We discuss some potential applications of this in categorifying non-abelian Hodge theory in a sense we will make precise. We also discuss potential applications of our methods and perspectives to the subjects of quiver varieties, abstract moduli theory, and homotopy theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stable pair on a projective variety consists of a sheaf and a global section subject to stability conditions parameterized by rational polynomials. We will show that for a smooth projective threefold and a class of a rank 2 sheaf, there are two stability chambers (in the space of rational polynomials under the lexicographic order) for which the moduli spaces of semistable pairs admit morphisms to a Gieseker moduli space of rank 2 semistable sheaves and a Hilbert scheme, respectively. In the latter moduli space, every semistable pair corresponds to a closed sub-scheme of codimension 2 with an extension class, providing a generalization of the Serre correspondence. These two moduli spaces are related by finitely many wall-crossings. We provide explicit descriptions of those wall-crossings for certain fixed numerical classes. In particular, these wall-crossings preserve the connectedness of the moduli space of semistable pairs.</description>

More precisely, we prove that a smooth and proper rigid analytic variety is algebraizable if and only if its category of perfect complexes is smooth and proper. As a corollary, we deduce an analogous statement for formal schemes and demonstrate that, in general, the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a formal scheme is not smooth.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the quadratically enriched count of rational curves in a smooth toric del Pezzo surface passing through $k$-rational points and pairs of conjugate points in quadratic field extensions $k\subset k(\sqrt{d_i})$ can be determined by counting certain tropical stable maps through vertically stretched point conditions with a suitable multiplicity. Building on the floor diagram technique in tropical geometry, we provide an algorithm to compute these numbers.
  Our tropical algorithm computes not only these new quadratically enriched enumerative invariants, but simultaneously also the complex Gromov-Witten invariant, the real Welschinger invariant counting curves satisfying real point conditions only, the real Welschinger invariant of curves satisfying pairs of complex conjugate and real point conditions, and the quadratically enriched count of curves satisfying $k$-rational point conditions.</description>

      <title>Classification of unimodal isolated complete intersection singularities in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we classify the unimodal isolated complete intersection singularities in arbitrary characteristic under contact equivalence. The classification over $\mathbb{C}$ has already done by A. Dimca and C.G. Gibson. We continue and generalize their work. To complete the classification, we generalized the complete transversal method into positive characteristic field, which is also useful in many other classification problem.</description>

      <title>Affine Schubert calculus and double coinvariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.09033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an action of the double coinvariant algebra
  $DR_n$ on the equivariant Borel-Moore homology of the affine flag variety
  $\widetilde{Fl}_n$ in type $A$, which has an explicit form in terms of
  the left and right action of the (extended) affine Weyl group and multiplication by Chern classes.
  Up to first order in the augmentation ideal, we show that it coincides with the
  action of the Cherednik algebra on the equivariant homology of
  the homogeneous affine Springer fiber $\widetilde{S}_{n,m} \subset \widetilde{Fl}_n$
  due to Yun and the second author, and therefore
  preserves the non-equivariant Borel-Moore homology groups $H_*(\widetilde{S}_{n,m})\hookrightarrow H_*(\widetilde{Fl}_n)$.
  We then define a geometric filtration
  $F_{a} H_*(\widetilde{S}_{n,n+1})=H_*(\widetilde{S}(a))$
  by closed subspaces $\widetilde{S}(a)\subset \widetilde{S}_{n,n+1}$,
  which we prove recovers the Garsia-Stanton descent order on $DR_n$. We use this to deduce an explicit monomial basis of $DR_n$, as well as an independent proof of the (non-compositional) Shuffle Theorem.</description>

      <title>Hecke Actions on Loops and Periods of Iterated Shimura Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the classical Hecke correspondences T_N, N&gt;0, act on the free abelian groups generated by the conjugacy classes of the modular group SL_2(Z) and the conjugacy classes of its profinite completion. We show that this action induces a dual action on the ring of class functions of a certain relative unipotent completion of the modular group. This ring contains all iterated integrals of modular forms that are constant on conjugacy classes. It possesses a natural mixed Hodge structure and, after tensoring with Q_ell$, a natural action of the absolute Galois group. Each Hecke operator preserves this mixed Hodge structure and commutes with the action of the absolute Galois group. Unlike in the classical case, the algebra generated by these Hecke operators is not commutative. The appendix by Pham Tiep is not included. It can be found at arXiv:2303.02807.</description>

      <title>Border Ranks of Positive and Invariant Tensor Decompositions: Applications to Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix rank and its positive versions are robust for small approximations, i.e. they do not decrease under small perturbations. In contrast, the multipartite tensor rank can collapse for arbitrarily small errors, i.e. there may be a gap between rank and border rank, leading to instabilities in the optimization over sets with fixed tensor rank. Can multipartite positive ranks also collapse for small perturbations? In this work, we prove that multipartite positive and invariant tensor decompositions exhibit gaps between rank and border rank, including tensor rank purifications and cyclic separable decompositions. We also prove a correspondence between positive decompositions and membership in certain sets of multipartite probability distributions, and leverage the gaps between rank and border rank to prove that these correlation sets are not closed. It follows that testing membership of probability distributions arising from resources like translational invariant Matrix Product States is impossible in finite time. Overall, this work sheds light on the instability of ranks and the unique behavior of bipartite systems.</description>

      <title>Unitary representations of real groups and localization theory for Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Schmid and the second named author that the unitarity of a representation of a real reductive Lie group with real infinitesimal character can be read off from a canonical filtration, the Hodge filtration. Our proof rests on three main ingredients. The first is a wall crossing theory for mixed Hodge modules: the key result is that, in certain natural families, the Hodge filtration varies semi-continuously with jumps controlled by extension functors. The second ingredient is a Hodge-theoretic refinement of Beilinson-Bernstein localization: we show that the Hodge filtration of a mixed Hodge module on the flag variety satisfies the usual cohomology vanishing and global generation properties enjoyed by the underlying $\mathcal{D}$-module. The third ingredient is an explicit calculation of the Hodge filtration on a tempered Hodge module. As byproducts of our work, we obtain a version of Saito's Kodaira vanishing for twisted mixed Hodge modules, a calculation of the Hodge filtration on a certain object in category $\mathcal{O}$, and a host of new vanishing results for coherent sheaves on flag varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study birational quasi-isomorphisms between normal Noetherian domains endowed with cluster structures of geometric type. We prove an analogue of the Starfish lemma that allows one to transfer various cluster and algebraic properties of one variety onto another. In particular, we develop tools for proving that an upper cluster algebra equals the given commutative ring.</description>

      <title>Geometric interactions between bricks and $\tau$-rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For finite dimensional algebras over algebraically closed fields, we prove some new results on the interactions between bricks and $\tau$-rigid modules, and also on their geometric counterparts-- brick components and generically $\tau$-reduced components. First, we give a new characterization of the locally representation-directed algebras and show that these are exactly the algebras for which every brick is $\tau$-rigid (hence, all indecomposable modules are bricks). We then consider analogous phenomena using some irreducible components of module varieties: the indecomposable components, brick components, and the indecomposable generically $\tau$-reduced components. For an algebra $A$, we prove that if two of these three sets of components coincide, then every indecomposable $\tau$-rigid $A$-module is a brick. For brick-infinite algebras, we also provide a new construction that yields, in some cases, a rational ray outside of the $\tau$-tilting fan (also called $g$-vector fan). For tame and $E$-tame algebras, we obtain new results on some open conjectures on $\tau$-tilting fans and bricks.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Spherical Witt Vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a direct construction of the ring spectrum of spherical Witt vectors of a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra R as the completion of the spherical monoid algebra $\mathbb{S}[R]$ of the multiplicative monoid $(R,\cdot)$ at the ideal $I = \mathrm{fib}(\mathbb{S}[R] \to R)$. This generalizes a construction of Cuntz and Deninger. We also use this to give a description of the category of p-complete modules over the spherical Witt vectors and a universal property for spherical Witt vectors as an $\mathbb{E}_1$-ring.</description>

Abstract: Mostly inspired by recent work by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, and Sheshmani, combined with previous work by Aganagic, Ooguri, Saulina and Vafa with regard to BPS black hole microstate counting in terms of topological field theory calculations, we will show how these tools can be applied to concrete setups arising from String Theory, and why the formalism of functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry needs to be further developed.</description>
