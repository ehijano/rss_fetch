      <title>Confocal Raman microscopy inside sessile multicomponent droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporating multicomponent droplets are ubiquitous and appear in a variety of everyday situations and technological applications, including coating, 3D printing, and energy conversion processes. During evaporation, concentration gradients are typically induced, resulting in flows within the droplets. Many of the mechanisms underlying multicomponent droplet evaporation are not fully understood. However, most methods utilize markers that can be surface active and thus affect droplet dynamics. Thus, high-resolution marker-free measurements of concentration gradients in evaporating multicomponent droplets are needed. Raman microscopy can provide such a method. However, as the Raman laser has to undergo a phase transition, it is refracted, leading to a distorted drop contour. In this study, we model refraction in the droplet to better understand the shift in focus leading to geometric distortion. The horizontal and vertical shifts in focus are analyzed, and a modified configuration that enables Raman measurements with a horizontal laser is introduced. For both configurations, the simulated drop shape in the Raman image fits well with the measured shape. While Raman measurements with a vertically incident laser allow the study of the upper part of the droplet, for droplets with large contact angles, horizontal Raman measurements allow for the analysis of the region around the 3-phase contact line. As an example, a concentration map of an evaporating 4.2 $\mu$L glycerol/water droplet is presented. The results of this study can be used as a guide for Raman microscopy measurements of droplets. These findings contribute to understanding droplet dynamics during evaporation and provide a basis for developing novel printing, cleaning, and energy conversion technology applications.</description>

      <title>Propulsion and interaction of wave-propelled interfacial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a floating body is internally or externally vibrated, its self-generated wavefield can lead to steady propulsion along the interface. In this article, we review several related and recently discovered systems that leverage this propulsion mechanism and interact hydrodynamically with one another via these surface waves. Particles with an onboard oscillatory driver may self-propel by virtue of a fore-aft asymmetric wavefield, a phenomenon with demonstrated relevance to biological and artificial systems across scales. Freely floating particles on a vibrated fluid bath can also self-propel along straight paths, but may also rotate in place or move along curved arcs, depending sensitively on the particle asymmetries and driving parameters. Such surfing particles interact at a distance through their mutual capillary wavefield and exhibit a rich array of collective dynamics. Overall, these accessible, tunable, and visually appealing systems motivate future investigations into a number of outstanding questions in fundamental fluid mechanics, while potentially also informing advances in the fields of active matter, hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and robotics.</description>

      <title>A network-theoretic approach for characterizing Mack-mode instability in high-speed boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a network theory-based approach to investigate the Mack-mode instability signature found in high-speed schlieren data from a Mach 6 laminar boundary layer flow over a $7^\circ$ cone. The data contain instability wave packets in the form of coherent rope-like structures which exhibit intermittency. The intermittency implies that conventional Fourier techniques are not particularly well suited for analysis. Network analysis, which is well known for handling episodic spatio-temporal data in a variety of complex systems, provides an alternate and more suitable framework. Techniques from time-varying spatial proximity networks are applied to the present data. The connected components in the network topology reveal lines of constant phase for coherent wave packets associated with the instability, and localized regions of high schlieren light intensity for intermittent laminar or turbulent flow states. The orientation angle of the connected network components is found to be a suitable metric for identifying components associated with the Mack-mode instability, and that enables detailed characterization of the wavelength and propagation speeds of the instability wave packets. Beyond the characterization exercise, network analysis can provide a powerful framework for understanding the fundamental nature of intermittency and its role in the laminar-to-turbulent flow transition process.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear projection-based model order reduction with machine learning regression for closure error modeling in the latent space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant advancement in nonlinear projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) is presented through a highly effective methodology. This methodology employs Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for closure error modeling in the latent space, offering notable gains in efficiency and expanding the scope of PMOR. Moving beyond the limitations of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), previously used for this task, this approach provides crucial advantages in terms of interpretability and a reduced demand for extensive training data. The capabilities of GPR and RBFs are showcased in two demanding applications: a two-dimensional parametric inviscid Burgers problem, featuring propagating shocks across the entire computational domain, and a complex three-dimensional turbulent flow simulation around an Ahmed body. The results demonstrate that this innovative approach preserves accuracy and achieves substantial improvements in efficiency and interpretability when contrasted with traditional PMOR and ANN-based closure modeling.</description>

      <title>Minimum-enstrophy and maximum-entropy equilibrium states in two-dimensional topographic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent numerical simulations of two-dimensional (2D) topographic turbulence, the minimum-enstrophy equilibrium state (Bretherton \&amp; Haidvogel,J. Fluid Mech., vol. 78, issue 1, 1976, pp. 129-154) with an underlying linear relation between potential vorticity and streamfunction cannot generally describe the final state, due to the presence of long-lived and isolated vortices above topographic extrema. We find that these vortices can be described by a ``$\sinh$'' vorticity-streamfunction relation that corresponds to the maximum-entropy equilibrium state proposed by Joyce \&amp; Montgomery (J. Plasma Phys., vol. 10, issue 1, 1973, pp. 107-121) and Montgomery \&amp; Joyce (Phys. Fluids, vol. 17, issue 6, 1974, pp. 1139-1145) for 2D flat-bottom turbulence. Motivated by recent observations that a linear PV-streamfunction relation depicts the background flow of 2D topographic turbulence, we propose to model the final state of the total flow by additionally superposing a ``$\sinh$'' relation to account for isolated vortices. We validate the empirical ``$\sinh$'' relation and composition model against the final states in 2D turbulence simulations configured with two simple domain-scale topographies: a sinusoidal bump plus a dip, and a zonal ridge plus a trench. Good agreements are obtained for both topographies, provided that the empirical theory must be adapted to the zonally averaged flow states over the latter. For the first time, our empirical theory correctly describes the final flow structures and uncovers the coexistence of two equilibrium states in 2D topographic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic consequences of wing damage in dragonflies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flapping wings are the primary means by which dragonflies generate forces, but they are susceptible to damage due to their inherent fragility. The damage results in a reduction in wing area and a distortion of the original wing, which in turn leads to a decline in flight ability. Furthermore, the flows of dragonfly fore- and hindwings exhibit an interaction, thus damage to the forewing can also impact the aerodynamic performance of the ipsilateral hindwing. In this study, we examine this problem through CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations on a series of damaged dragonfly fore-/hindwing models according to the probability of area loss from the literature. The flow fields and aerodynamic forces for the different damaged wing cases are compared with those for the intact wings. This comparative analysis reveals how the different patterns of wing damage modify the vortex structures around the flapping wings and lead to a drop in aerodynamic force production. The causes behind the diminishing aerodynamic performance are shown to be subtler than the pure area loss and are regulated by the changes in the flow field that result from wing damage. Wing-wing interaction becomes particularly important when forewing damage occurs.</description>

      <title>Guided Unconditional and Conditional Generative Models for Super-Resolution and Inference of Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of the ocean, weather, and climate are coarse, and observations are sparse and gappy. In this work, we apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra. Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in geophysical inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A simplified unified wave-particle method for diatomic gases with rotational and vibrational non-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypersonic flow around near-space vehicles constitutes a multi-scale flow problem. Due to insufficient molecular collisions to achieve equilibrium, rarefied gas effects are present in the flow field. Thus, numerical methods capable of accurately resolving multi-scale flows are required. Furthermore, high-temperature gas effects in hypersonic flows mean vibrational excitation of polyatomic molecules. Consequently, numerical methods accounting for non-equilibrium in rotational and vibrational internal energy modes are required. This study derives a quantified model-competition (QMC) mechanism for diatomic gases with rotational and vibrational non-equilibrium, starting from integral solutions of kinetic model equations with rotational and vibrational energy. The QMC mechanism categorize collisional and free-transport particles in cell, applying computational weighting based on their local scale regimes. We developed a simplified unified wave-particle (SUWP) method for diatomic gases based on QMC mechanism. For the macroscopic of the method, a three-temperature model accounting for rotational and vibrational energy is incorporated into both the kinetic inviscid flux scheme and {Navier-Stokes} solvers. For the microscopic of the method, a collisionless DSMC solver is employed to resolve non-equilibrium flow physics. This work validates the proposed SUWP method with rotational and vibrational non-equilibrium through benchmark cases, including shock tube, shock structures, flow past a cylinder, Apollo 6 command module and space station Mir. Compared to the DSMC and deterministic methods, the SUWP method exhibits favorable computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>Insight into the combustion dynamics of ITA-driven swirl flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the flame, flow, and acoustic coupling of Intrinsic ThermoAcoustic (ITA) driven combustion instability using a high-shear swirl injector in a model combustor. The combustor is operated using pure methane and methane-hydrogen mixture as fuels with air in a partially premixed mode. In this study, the airflow rate is varied by keeping the fuel flow rates constant, corresponding to the Reynolds number range of 8000-19000 and a fixed thermal power of 16 kW. Acoustic pressure in the combustion chamber, high-speed OH$^*$, CH$^*$ chemiluminescence images, high-speed particle image velocimetry, and steady exhaust gas temperature are measured for scrutiny. The combustor shows non-monotonic variations in the acoustic pressure amplitude for both fuels. A wider operating envelope and relatively large amplitude acoustic fluctuations are observed for the methane-hydrogen mixture compared with pure methane. Both methane and methane-hydrogen mixtures exhibit a linear increase in dominant instability frequencies with airflow, indicating the ITA-driven combustion instability. A low-order network model is developed that incorporates a simple $n-\tau$ flame response. It reproduces the observed dominant instability frequency by taking in the convective time delay from the experiments that substantiates the ITA-driven instability. Spatio-temporally resolved flame and flow dynamics show periodic axisymmetric vortex shedding from the outer shear layer and its subsequent interaction with CRZ during large amplitude acoustic oscillations. At relatively low amplitude, the vortices shed from both inner and outer shear layers convect downstream at different velocities without interacting with each other. The periodic vortex shedding process across the operating condition is further examined using a simplified model representing vortex dynamics...</description>

      <title>Evaporation of sessile drops on a heated superhydrophobic substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the evaporation dynamics of sessile water droplets on a micro-nano textured superhydrophobic aluminum substrate at various temperatures using shadowgraphy imaging. By comparing the evaporation behavior of two droplets placed side-by-side with that of an isolated droplet, we find that droplets in the two-drop system evaporate more slowly due to the vapor shielding effect, which increases vapor concentration between the droplets. This leads to asymmetric evaporation and longer lifetimes, particularly at room temperature compared to higher temperatures. At room temperature, the isolated droplet primarily follows a constant contact angle (CCA) mode, with occasional stick-slip events. The two-drop system predominantly exhibits CCA mode for most of its lifetime, with mixed-mode evaporation and some stick-slip behavior. At elevated temperatures, the isolated droplet maintains a nearly constant contact angle for the first half of its lifetime, transitioning to a mixed evaporation mode with occasional stick-slip events. In contrast, the two-drop system follows a mixed evaporation mode throughout, with occasional stick-slip behavior. Furthermore, a comprehensive theoretical model that accounts for diffusion, evaporative cooling, and convection accurately captures the evaporation dynamics of sessile droplets on a superhydrophobic substrate in both isolated and paired configurations at elevated substrate temperatures. In contrast, a diffusion-based model alone adequately describes the evaporation behaviour at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic control of metafluids for fluid-like applications of metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials are structures composed of repeating unit-cells which enable macro-scale properties not found in nature. Since metamaterials are typically solid structures with predetermined interconnections, it is challenging to leverage their unique properties for many critical applications that require fluid-like behavior, such as heat engines or cooling cycles. Recent research suggested overcoming this limitation by creating a mechanical metafluid', which is a lubricated suspension of multistable unit-cells. However, realization of this concept necessitates the ability to control both velocity and state of the metafluid. Here, we propose the use of time-varying magnetic fields as a mechanism to manipulate metafluids. We focus on a lattice of magnetic multistable capsules enclosing gas and suspended within a liquid-filled tube. We derive the governing equations and examine one-dimensional fluid mechanics of the metafluid, both theoretically and experimentally, at the viscous limit under magnetic actuation. By applying time-varying magnetic fields, we control both the local compression and expansion of the capsules, as well as the entire flow field. Our theoretical results are compared with experimental data, showing good agreement. This work paves the way for the utilization of mechanical metamaterials to applications that require fluid-like behavior, thus extending the scope of metamaterial applications.</description>

      <title>On a mathematical definition of laminar and turbulent fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As stated in the title, the present research proposes a mathematical definition of laminar and turbulent flows, i.e., a definition that may be used to conceive and prove mathematical theorems about such flows. The definition is based on an experimental truth long known to humans: Whenever one repeats a given flow, the results will not be the same if the flow is turbulent. Turbulent flows are not strictly repeatable. From this basic fact follows a more elaborate truth about turbulent flows: The mean flow obtained by averaging the results of a large number of repetitions is not a natural flow, that is, it is a flow that cannot occur naturally in any experiment. The proposed definition requires some preliminary mathematical notions, which are also introduced in the text: Proximity between functions, the ensemble of realisations, the method of averaging the flows, and the distinct properties of realisations (physical flows) and averages (mean flows). The notion of restricted nonlinearity is introduced and it is demonstrated that laminar flows can only exist in conditions of restricted nonlinearity, whereas turbulent flows are a consequence of general nonlinearity. The particular case of steady-state turbulent flow is studied, and an uncertainty is raised about the equality of ensemble average and time average. Two solved examples are also offered to illustrate the meaning and methods implied by the definitions: The von K\`arm\`an vortex street and a laminar flow with imposed white-noise perturbation.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Giant Electrostatic Modulation of Ion Permeation in Atomically Small Capillaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the electrostatic double layer and tuning the conductance in nanofluidic systems at salt concentrations of 100 mM or higher has been a persistent challenge. The primary reasons are (i) the short electrostatic proximity length, ~3-10 {\AA}, and (ii) difficulties in fabricating atomically small capillaries. Here, we successfully fabricate in-plane vermiculite laminates with transport heights of ~3-5 {\AA}, which exhibit a cation selectivity close to 1 even at a 1000 mM concentration, suggesting an overlapping electrostatic double layer. For gate voltages from -2 V to +1 V, the K+-intercalated vermiculite shows a remarkable conductivity modulation exceeding 1400% at a 1000 mM KCl concentration. The gated ON/OFF ratio is mostly unaffected by the ion concentration (10-1000 mM), which confirms that the electrostatic double layer overlaps with the collective ion movement within the channel with reduced activation energy. In contrast, vermiculite laminates intercalated with Ca2+ and Al3+ ions display reduced conductance with increasing negative gate voltage, highlighting the importance of ion-specific gating effects under {\AA}-scale confinement. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrostatic phenomena occurring in highly confined fluidic channels, opening the way to the exploration of the vast library of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Filter for Data Assimilation coupled with low-resolution computations techniques applied in Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00539v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Reduced-Order Model (ROM) for merging experimental and simulation data using Data Assimilation (DA) to estimate the "True" state of a fluid dynamics system, leading to more accurate predictions. Our methodology introduces a novel approach implementing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) within a reduced-dimensional framework, grounded in a robust theoretical foundation and applied to fluid dynamics. To address the substantial computational demands of DA, the proposed ROM employs low-resolution (LR) techniques to drastically reduce computational costs. This approach involves downsampling datasets for DA computations, followed by an advanced reconstruction technique based on low-cost Singular Value Decomposition (lcSVD). The lcSVD method, a key innovation in this paper, has never been applied to DA before and offers a highly efficient way to enhance resolution with minimal computational resources. Our results demonstrate significant reductions in both computation time and RAM usage through the LR techniques without compromising the accuracy of the estimations. For instance, in a turbulent test case, the LR approach with a compression rate of 15.9 can achieve a speed-up of 13.7 and a RAM compression of 90.9% while maintaining a low Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 2.6%, compared to 0.8% in the high-resolution (HR) reference. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the EnKF in estimating and predicting the state of fluid flow systems based on limited observations and low-fidelity numerical data. This paper highlights the potential of the proposed DA method in fluid dynamics applications, particularly for improving computational efficiency in CFD and related fields. Its ability to balance accuracy with low computational and memory costs makes it suitable for large-scale and real-time applications, such as environmental monitoring or aerospace.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium distribution of the liquid phase in an unsaturated granular material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an unsaturated granular material, the spatial distribution of the liquid phase results from the competition between gravity and capillary forces. We show that, in the funicular regime, it can be described by a Boltzmann law, with static disorder playing the role of thermal agitation. We propose an approach based on a Langevin equation to derive this distribution, and compare our predictions with conductivity measurements giving the local water content as a function of height in a wet granular medium. We show that experimental data obtained with samples of different polydispersities collapse on a single master curve consistent with our model.</description>

      <title>Large-eddy simulation of turbulent spray flames: Effects of scalar correlation and enthalpy reduction in flamelet modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01045v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of turbulent spray combustion provides a promising tool for advanced engine design. In spray flames, the droplet evaporation not only reduces the ambient gas temperature, but also influences flame structure by generating substantial local fluctuations of the mixture fraction $\widetilde{Z}$ and progress variable $\widetilde{c}$. These two scalars, conventionally assumed independent in flamelet models, exhibit significant correlations arising from the coupling among evaporation, turbulent mixing and chemical reactions. This study proposes a six-dimensional flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) method, considering the evaporation-induced specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation. A novel joint presumed probability density function (PDF) method is derived using the copula theory, achieving rapid grid convergence and good feasibility. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is performed on the Sydney ethanol turbulent spray flames (EtF1, EtF4 and EtF7), which feature different ethanol mass flow rates and jet Reynolds numbers. Both gas and liquid phase statistics show good agreement with experimental data across the three flames. The incorporation of specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation in FGM modeling improves gas temperature predictions, along with enhanced liquid-phase prediction through refined gas-field resolution. The correlation coefficient of $\widetilde{Z}$ and $\widetilde{c}$ is found to be a competing result of local evaporation and combustion, since evaporation elevates $\widetilde{Z}$ and dilutes reaction products, whereas chemical reactions enhance $\widetilde{c}$ fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing 3D Reattached Flow on an Airfoil with Finite-Span Synthetic Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes prior studies to develop a comprehensive three-dimensional description of reattached flow over an airfoil controlled by finite-span SJA arrays. When applied to a longer-span wing, the flow field exhibits three distinct regions: a directly controlled region, an unaffected region, and a transitional zone between them. Through the integration of multiple visualizations and measurements from both discrete and slot-style SJAs, this work provides insights into the shear layer behavior. The analysis of reattached mean flow provides insight into the interactions between controlled and surrounding flows, demonstrating broad applicability across different SJA configurations</description>

      <title>Spinning Twisted Ribbons: When Two Holes Meet on a Curved Liquid Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rupture of a liquid film, where a thin liquid layer between two other fluids breaks and forms holes, commonly occurs in both natural phenomena and industrial applications. The post-rupture dynamics, from initial hole formation to the complete collapse of the film, are crucial because they govern droplet formation, which plays a significant role in many applications such as disease transmission, aerosol formation, spray drying nanodrugs, oil spill remediation, inkjet printing, and spray coating. While single-hole rupture has been extensively studied, the dynamics of multiple-hole ruptures, especially the interactions between neighboring holes, are less well understood. Here, this study reveals that when two holes 'meet' on a curved film, the film evolves into a spinning twisted ribbon before breaking into droplets, distinctly different from what occurs on flat films. We explain the formation and evolution of the spinning twisted ribbon, including its geometry, corrugations, ligaments, and orbits, and compare the experimental observations with models. We compare and contrast this phenomena with its counterpart on planar films. While our experiments are based on the multiple-hole ruptures in corona splash, the underlying principles are likely applicable to other systems. This study sheds light on understanding and controlling droplet formation in multiple-hole rupture, improving public health, climate science, and various industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A generalisable data-augmented turbulence model with progressive and interpretable corrections for incompressible wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of interpretability and generalisability in data-driven turbulence modelling remains a fundamental challenge for computational fluid dynamics applications. This study yields a generalisable advancement of the $k$-$\omega$ Shear Stress Transport (SST) model through a progressive data-augmented framework, combining Bayesian optimisation with physics-guided corrections to improve the predictions of anisotropy-induced secondary flows and flow separation simultaneously. Two interpretable modifications are systematically embedded: 1) a non-linear Reynolds stress anisotropy correction to enhance secondary flow predictions, and 2) an activation-based separation correction in the $\omega$-equation, regulated by an optimised power-law function to locally adjust turbulent viscosity under adverse pressure gradients. The model is trained using a multi-case computational fluid dynamics-driven a posteriori approach, incorporating periodic hills, duct flow, and channel flow to balance correction efficacy with baseline consistency. Validation across multiple unseen cases -- spanning flat-plate boundary layers, high-Reynolds-number periodic hills, and flow over diverse obstacle configurations -- demonstrates enhanced accuracy in velocity profiles, recirculation zones, streamwise vorticity, and skin friction distributions while retaining the robustness of the original $k$-$\omega$ SST in attached flows. Sparsity-enforced regression ensures reduced parametric complexity, preserving computational efficiency and physical transparency. Results underscore the framework's ability to generalise across geometries and Reynolds numbers without destabilising corrections, offering a validated framework toward deployable, data-augmented turbulence models for numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Prediction of High Explosive Induced Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underwater explosions produce complex fluid phenomena relevant to diverse applications including maritime engineering, medical therapeutics, and inertial confinement fusion. These systems exhibit multiphase flows, chemical kinetics, and highly compressible dynamics that challenge traditional computational approaches. Current hydrodynamic solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and non-differentiable, limiting their use in design optimization and real-time applications. Here we show that deep neural networks can predict underwater explosion-induced fluid dynamics 4,025 times faster than traditional solvers while maintaining mean absolute percent errors below 0.005\% across all fluid state variables. Our approach maps from explosive material thermodynamic parameters to the temporal evolution of shock fronts and material interfaces, enabling rapid prediction of system behavior for a broad range of ideal explosive materials. Feature importance analysis reveals that exponential decay parameters of the explosive equation of state are the primary drivers of system dynamics, uncovering a previously unknown relationship between thermodynamic compatibility and energy transfer efficiency at material interfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate an inverse design framework that leverages the differentiability of our neural surrogate to perform parameter discovery, recovering unknown explosive material properties to within 1\% accuracy through gradient-based optimization. This combination of rapid inference, physical insight, and inverse design capabilities provides a route to engineering controlled fluid behavior in underwater explosive systems through material design. We anticipate our approach could enable new applications in defense systems, underwater manufacturing, and medical procedures where precise control of shock waves and bubble dynamics is essential.</description>

      <title>Topological Entropy of Stationary Turbulent Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological entropy serves as a viable candidate for quantifying mixing and complexity of a highly chaotic system. Particularly in turbulence, this is determined as the exponential stretching rate of a fluid material line that typically necessitates a Lagrangian description. We extend the recent work [A. Manoharan, S. Subramanian, and A. Joy, arXiv:2412.08996] to three dimensions, and present an exact Eulerian framework for the topological entropy in stationary turbulent flows that is devoid of free parameters. The only prerequisite is a distribution of eigenvalues of the local strain-rate tensor and their decorrelation times. This can be easily obtained from a single wire probe at a fixed location, thereby eliminating the need for Lagrangian particle tracking, which remains formidable due to chaotic nature of the flow. We believe that our results lend great utility in experiments aimed at understanding transport and mixing in many industrial and natural flows.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Finite-Time Fluctuation Relation in isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy generation rate in turbulence can be defined using the energy cascade rate as described in the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill equation at a specified length scale. The fluctuation relation (FR) from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which predicts exponential behaviour of the ratio of probability densities for positive and negative entropy production rates, was confirmed in prior work \citep{yao2023entropy}, but under certain limiting assumptions. We here examine the applicability of FR to isotropic turbulence under less stringent assumptions by analyzing entropy generation rates averaged over intervals ranging from one to several eddy turnover times. Based on time-resolved data at a Taylor-scale based Reynolds number $Re_\lambda = 433$, we find that the FR is valid in the sense that very close to exponential behaviour of probability ratios of positive and negative entropy generation (forward and inverse cascade of energy) is observed. Interestingly, finite-time averaging yields FR-consistent results only within a Lagrangian framework, along fluid trajectories using filtered convective velocities. In contrast, the FR does not hold with time-averaging at fixed (Eulerian) positions. Results provide evidence that the definition of entropy generation based on the scale-integrated Kolmogorov-Hill equation describes turbulent cascade processes that exhibit properties predicted by non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>STONet: A neural operator for modeling solute transport in micro-cracked reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel neural operator, the Solute Transport Operator Network (STONet), to efficiently model contaminant transport in micro-cracked porous media. STONet's model architecture is specifically designed for this problem and uniquely integrates an enriched DeepONet structure with a transformer-based multi-head attention mechanism, enhancing performance without incurring additional computational overhead compared to existing neural operators. The model combines different networks to encode heterogeneous properties effectively and predict the rate of change of the concentration field to accurately model the transport process. The training data is obtained using finite element (FEM) simulations by random sampling of micro-fracture distributions and applied pressure boundary conditions, which capture diverse scenarios of fracture densities, orientations, apertures, lengths, and balance of pressure-driven to density-driven flow. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that, once trained, STONet achieves accurate predictions, with relative errors typically below 1% compared with FEM simulations while reducing runtime by approximately two orders of magnitude. This type of computational efficiency facilitates building digital twins for rapid assessment of subsurface contamination risks and optimization of environmental remediation strategies. The data and code for the paper will be published at https://github.com/ehsanhaghighat/STONet.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering, Emergent Interactions of Solitons in the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation through Conservative and non-Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, originally a three dimensional mathematical model of plasma with a uniform magnetic field, is a direct extension of the KdV equation into higher dimensions and is a typical quasi-integrable system. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study the collision of soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. PINNs are able to successfully solve the equations in the forward process, and the solutions are obtained using a mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation, taking into account conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper form of the equation can be successfully derived from a given training data. However, the situation becomes intractable in the collision process. The forward analysis result no longer adheres to the laws of conservation, and is better described as a dynamically incompatible field configuration (DIFC) than a solution to the system. Conservative PINNs have thus been introduced for this purpose, and in this paper we succeed in obtaining solutions that satisfy conservation laws. The inverse analysis suggests a different equation in which the coefficients exhibit significant changes, implying an emergence of temporary interactions. With these modulated coefficients, we recalculate the equation and confirm that the adherence to the laws of conservation has unquestionably improved.</description>

      <title>A novel Trunk Branch-net PINN for flow and heat transfer prediction in porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Trunk-Branch (TB)-net physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture is developed, which is a PINN-based method incorporating trunk and branch nets to capture both global and local features. The aim is to solve four main classes of problems: forward flow problem, forward heat transfer problem, inverse heat transfer problem, and transfer learning problem within the porous medium, which are notoriously complex that could not be handled by origin PINN. In the proposed TB-net PINN architecture, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FNN) is used as the trunk net, followed by separated FNNs as the branch nets with respect to outputs, and automatic differentiation is performed for partial derivatives of outputs with respect to inputs by considering various physical loss. The effectiveness and flexibility of the novel TB-net PINN architecture is demonstrated through a collection of forward problems, and transfer learning validates the feasibility of resource reuse. Combining with the superiority over traditional numerical methods in solving inverse problems, the proposed TB-net PINN shows its great potential for practical engineering applications.</description>
