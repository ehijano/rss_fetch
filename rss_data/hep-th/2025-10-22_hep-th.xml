      <title>Holographic Systems out of Equilibrium: From Flavor Branes to SYK Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis studies the non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly coupled quantum systems within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, with particular emphasis on periodically driven (Floquet) systems. The first part focuses on top-down holographic constructions based on D3/D5 and D3/D7 brane intersections subjected to time-dependent external fields. In the D3/D5 system at finite temperature, we analyze the response to a rotating electric field and uncover a rich non-equilibrium phase structure containing conductive and insulating phases, vector meson Floquet condensates, and Floquet suppression points. In the D3/D7 setup, we study the effects of helical magnetic fields on chiral symmetry breaking, showing that sufficiently helical magnetc fields can restore chiral symmetry. The second part examines the periodically driven Maldacena-Qi model, a two-site extension of the SYK model dual to a traversable wormhole. We identify resonances that enhance or suppress the wormhole traversability and find evidence that the unstable region of the phase diagram can be dynamically accessed. We use our driving protocols to access this region and compute its Lyapunov exponent. Overall, this thesis advances the use of the holographic techniques to probe non-equilibrium steady states and real-time dynamics in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A spin on Hagedorn temperatures and string stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the correspondence between highly excited strings and black holes in the presence of angular momentum. At fixed imaginary angular velocity $\nu$, we show that free strings exhibit a Hagedorn instability, explained, as in Atick-Witten, by a thermal-winding mode turning tachyonic. This allows us to determine the exact Hagedorn temperature $\beta_H(\nu)$ for bosonic, type II, and heterotic strings. Using the effective field theory for the thermal-winding mode around the $\nu$-dependent background, we find a novel `rotating string star' saddle (perturbatively in the angular velocity) and study its properties. This configuration describes a self-gravitating bound state of highly excited rotating strings. As in the non-rotating case, the saddle is qualitatively shown to interpolate between the rotating strings phase and a rotating black hole. We also comment on the implications of these results for anti-de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Junctions, strings, clocks and gravitational memory in three dimensional dS space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that non-trivial stringy excitations in Lorentzian three dimensional de Sitter spacetime can be created self-consistently from gravitational memory in the infinite past. In addition to demonstrating that the Nambu-Goto equations for the string emerge from the gravitational junction conditions, we establish the existence of well-behaved solutions corresponding to transient fluctuations of a closed string about the equator which are both borne out of and dissolve to distinct gravitational memory in the infinite past and future, respectively. The solutions of the junction conditions also reveal that a transient string excitation sets up a clock self-consistently without the need of an external observer.</description>

      <title>Resonance phenomena in vortex-antivortex collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a full map of scattering scenarios between a Nielsen-Olesen vortex and antivortex. Importantly, in the deep type II regime, such a collision reveals a chaotic pattern in the final state formation with bounce windows immersed into annihilation regions. This structure is due to the energy transfer mechanism triggered by a quasinormal mode, specifically the Feshbach resonant mode, hosted by the vortex.</description>

      <title>New punctures for six-dimensional compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional superconformal field theories (SCFTs) give rise to four-dimensional (4d) ones when compactified on Riemann surfaces. In the $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ case, this yields the famous class S family. For $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ theories that arise from linear unitary quivers, the holographic duals of the 4d theories are known in massive IIA supergravity, but only without punctures. Working in the probe approximation, we identify all possible BPS punctures in these models and characterize them by computing their defect Weyl anomalies. For class S, our results reproduce the known expressions in the appropriate limit. In the more general $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ case, they predict new 4d SCFTs and their large-$N$ anomaly coefficients.</description>

      <title>Holography of K-complexity: Switchbacks and Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study Krylov complexity in the presence of single and multiple operators in the DSSYK model, where we can use the analytical techniques coming from chord diagrammatics. One of the results we obtain is that it showcases the switchback effect, when the appropriate ``triple-scaling limit'' is taken, under which the model becomes dual to semiclassical JT gravity. We build on previous work, where it was shown that, in the continuum limit, Krylov complexity is defined as the sum of expectations value of right and left chord number operators. Here we argue that this property signals the emergence of the geometric nature of this notion of K-complexity. We show that in the regime where DSSYK is dual to semi-classical gravity, the light matter chord corresponds to a shockwave insertion in JT gravity. We identify the geodesic-length dual of the operator complexity and extend the relevant holographic dictionary to describe the details of the matter insertions. Additionally, we define a class of two-sided perturbations of the Lanczos algorithm that allows to analyze the switchback effect. In the appropriate semi-classical limit, this perturbed operator complexity is dual to an ERB length in JT gravity with corresponding shockwave insertions. We thus establish that K-complexity exhibits the expected switchback effect and universal late-time linear growth, consistent with previous findings regarding its geometric nature in the holographic bulk-boundary map.</description>

      <title>Classical limit of a scalar quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a minimal distance emerges in quantum field theories owing to the need to regularize the UV divergences. The macroscopical limit at large minimal distance, weak spatial resolution, is investigated for a self interacting scalar quantum field theory by the help of the renormalization group. The lowering of the cutoff always opens the dynamics hence the renormalization group has to be implemented for open quantum field theories. A strongly coupled non-relativistic scaling regime is found supporting a second order phase transition between weakly and strongly open theories. The weakly (strongly) open bare theories develop into strongly (weakly) open dynamics during the renormalization group flow. The two known conditions of classical limit, the strong decoherence and the suppression of the quantum fluctuations are confirmed for closed bare theories at distances beyond a non-relativistic correlation length.</description>

      <title>Quantum evolution of de Sitter black holes near extremality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of charged, asymptotically de Sitter black holes close to the cold extremal branch of the phase space. We consider black hole sizes that are parametrically smaller than both their inverse temperature and the cosmological horizon. Unlike flat space, charged de Sitter black holes do not evolve towards extremality, but rather towards a thermal equilibrium with the cosmological horizon. In the low-temperature regime, the near-horizon physics can be effectively captured by a one-dimensional Schwarzian theory. This is coupled to the far-horizon de Sitter quantum field theory. Incorporating the thermal nature of the cosmological horizon, we compute the quantum energy transfer through uncharged massless scalar particles. The results significantly differ from Hawking's thermal predictions. Black holes that are hotter than the cosmological horizon emit energy at a rate lower than their asymptotically flat counterparts. Whereas much colder ones absorb energy at a nearly constant rate.</description>

      <title>Multi-Instantons, Multi-Axions, and Non-Invertible Symmetries in 4d QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-invertible global symmetries in 4d quantum field theories, aiming to generalize existing discussions to theories with multiple instantons and axions, and to make the subject more accessible to particle phenomenology.
  Building on both the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly construction and the half-space gauging approach, we identify the 3d topological quantum field theories required to describe non-invertible symmetries in the presence of multi-instanton effects. To this end, we introduce a method we call partial gauging and show that partial gauging of 3d Chern-Simons theories naturally leads to anomaly inflow actions with general ABJ anomaly matrices. We further generalize the half-space gauging construction to the case of multiple gauge sectors and compute correlation functions of boundary line operators. This enables us to analyze the action of non-invertible operators on various species of 't Hooft lines and to interpret the results in terms of the Witten effect. For theories with multiple axions, we determine both the non-invertible 0-form and 1-form symmetries, as well as their actions on axion strings and 't Hooft lines, thereby generalizing the previously known notion of the non-invertible Gauss law.
  Our framework unifies several previously disparate constructions, provides a concrete Lagrangian-based formulation of non-invertible symmetries, and naturally extends to theories with multiple instantons and axions, which are of both phenomenological and theoretical interest. These results may also find broader applications in beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-entropy from Linking in Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multipartite entanglement structure of quantum states prepared by the Euclidean path integral over three-manifolds with multiple torus boundaries (the so-called link states) in both Abelian and non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. For three-component link states in the Abelian theory, we derive an explicit formula for the R\'enyi multi-entropy in terms of linking numbers. We further show that the genuine multi-entropy faithfully quantifies the tripartite entanglement generated by GHZ-states, consistent with the fact that the prepared states are stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified viewpoint of Gribov--Zwanziger and Serreau--Tissier gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a unified Landau--gauge fixing that continuously interpolates between the viewpoints of the Serreau--Tissier (ST) copy-averaged formulation and the (Refined) Gribov--Zwanziger (RGZ) restriction to the first Gribov region. By combining the ST weight with a GZ-type horizon term and localizing both through the replica trick and the BRST-invariant $A_\mu^h$ formulation, we obtain a single, local, BRST-invariant, power-counting renormalizable action. Algebraic renormalization shows that all counterterms are reabsorbed by a common set of field and parameter renormalizations, therefore the unification is algebraic rather than merely additive. The replica sector yields a radiatively generated gluon screening mass, while the RGZ parameters are fixed by the horizon and condensate gap equations; we also give infrared matching conditions that link both descriptions at small momentum. We present a compact BRST-superspace rewriting of the RGZ block and a simple hybrid superspace that hosts the ST replicas and RGZ side by side; these add no dynamics and organize the Ward-identity analysis. The resulting gluon propagator interpolates among the massive Faddeev--Popov--ST and the RGZ decoupling forms. This framework offers a controlled way to study how infrared Yang--Mills correlators depend on the balance between copy averaging and horizon suppression, and it suggests practical lattice tests through tunable copy weighting.</description>

      <title>Covariant field theory of 3D massive fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a covariant and gauge-invariant theory describing massive fractons in three spacetime dimensions, based on a symmetric rank-2 tensor field. The model includes a Chern-Simons-like term that plays a dual role: it generates a topological mass for the tensor gauge field and simultaneously acts as a source of intrinsic fractonic matter. This dual mechanism is novel and leads to a propagating fractonic degree of freedom described by a massive Klein-Gordon equation. The theory propagates two degrees of freedom -- one massive, one massless -- whose number is preserved in the massless limit, in analogy with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons mechanism of Deser-Jackiw-Templeton. We analyze the resulting equations of motion and show that the intrinsic fractonic matter satisfies Gauss- and Amp\`ere-like laws, with conserved dipole and trace of the quadrupole moment. Upon coupling to external matter, a second fractonic sector emerges, leading to a coexistence of intrinsic and extrinsic subsystems with different mobility and conservation properties. Our model provides a unified framework for describing massive fractons with internal structure, and offers a covariant setting for exploring their interactions and extensions.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Completion of the Big Bang in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum quadratic gravity inflationary scenario that can accommodate the new cosmological constraints, which have disfavored Starobinsky inflation. The theory is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet, but 1-loop running is found to dynamically lead to slow-roll inflation toward the infrared. When a large number of matter fields contribute to the beta functions, the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be phenomenologically viable. We find that as inflation ends, the theory approaches its strong coupling regime and general relativity must emerge, as an effective field theory, as the universe must reheat and enter its standard radiation era. In order to avoid strong coupling, a minimum tensor-to-scalar ratio of 0.01 is predicted for this theory. Our framework offers a laboratory for connecting a concrete ultraviolet completion (quantum quadratic gravity) with inflationary dynamics, reheating, and precise cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Sharp Transitions for Subsystem Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circuit complexity of time-evolved pure quantum states grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time. This behavior has been proven in certain models, is conjectured to hold for generic quantum many-body systems, and is believed to be dual to the long-time growth of black hole interiors in AdS/CFT. Achieving a similar understanding for mixed states remains an important problem. In this work, we study the circuit complexity of time-evolved subsystems of pure quantum states. We find that for greater-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time, similarly to that of the full state. However, for less-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity rises and then falls, returning to low complexity as the subsystem equilibrates. Notably, the transition between these two regimes occurs sharply at half system size. We use holographic duality to map out this picture of subsystem complexity dynamics and rigorously prove the existence of the sharp transition in random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we use holography to predict features of complexity growth at finite temperature that lie beyond the reach of techniques based on random quantum circuits. In particular, at finite temperature, we argue for an additional sharp transition at a critical less-than-half subsystem size. Below this critical value, the subsystem complexity saturates nearly instantaneously rather than exhibiting a rise and fall. This novel phenomenon, as well as an analogous transition above half system size, provides a target for future studies based on rigorous methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use an approximation of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli potential, known as P\"{o}schl-Teller, to exactly compute the time-domain Green function of black hole perturbations in this simplified model, taking into account all causality conditions. We find the existence of an additional early times piece in the Green function, contributing to new exponentially growing modes just before the signal interacts with the maximum of the potential. The waveform itself is decomposed as an instantaneous piece traveling exactly on the light-cones of the Green function and a historical piece depending on the past trajectory of the system inside the light-cone. We also study redshift modes and show that the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli Green function is regular at their frequency, with no zero nor pole.</description>

      <title>Amplification of new physics in the quasinormal mode spectrum of highly-rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that perturbatively-small higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action can lead to order-one modifications of the quasinormal mode spectrum of near-extremal Kerr black holes. The spectrum of such black holes contains zero-damping modes (ZDMs) and damped modes (DMs), with the latter only existing when the ratio $\mu=m/(l+1/2)$ is below a critical value $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}\approx 0.744$. Thus, this value represents a "phase boundary" that separates a region with both ZDMs and DMs and a region with only ZDMs. We find that the modes lying close to the phase boundary are very sensitive to modifications of GR, as their lifetimes receive corrections inversely proportional to their distance to the boundary. We link this growth of the corrections to a modification of the critical point $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}$, which can lead to a change in the number of DMs and produce order-one effects in the spectrum. We show that these large effects can take place in a regime in which the higher-derivative expansion remains under control. We also perform an exact analysis of the modification of the phase boundary for lower $(l,m)$ modes and pinpoint those that are most sensitive to corrections. Our results indicate that spectroscopy of highly-rotating black holes is by far the most powerful way to search for new physics in ringdown signals.</description>

      <title>Gravity with higher-curvature terms and second-order field equations: $f(\mathcal{R})$ meets Gauss-Bonnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity is expected to break down in the high-curvature regime. Beyond an effective field theory treatment with higher-order operators, it is important to identify consistent theories with higher-curvature terms at the nonperturbative level. Two well-studied examples are $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same vacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter suffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the strong-coupling regime. We show that combining these two theories leads to genuinely new phenomena beyond their simple superposition. The resulting framework falls outside Horndeski's class, as it can be recast as a gravitational theory involving two nonminimally coupled scalar fields with nontrivial mutual interactions. This construction naturally extends EdGB gravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile setting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic corrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\mathcal{R})$ terms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting solutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes with certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a nontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the black-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity structure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of pure EdGB gravity. This suggests that, at the nonperturbative level, the theory's ill-posedness cannot be resolved by adding individual higher-order terms. This conjecture could be tested by studying the nonlinear dynamics, which remains governed by second-order field equations.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible bosonic chiral symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we realize the 3 + 1 dimensional non-invertible ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ chiral symmetry generator as an operator in a many body lattice Hilbert space. A crucial ingredient in our construction is the use of infinite dimensional $U(1)$ rotor site Hilbert spaces. Specifically, our Hilbert space is that of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory coupled to a charge $1$ scalar in the Villain formulation, which allows for direct access to monopoles and for a simple definition of a magnetic ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ one-form symmetry $Z^{(1)}_m$ , at the lattice Hamiltonian level. We construct the generator of the ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ chiral symmetry as as a unitary operator in the subspace of $Z^{(1)}_m$-invariant states, and show that it cannot be extended to the entire Hilbert space while preserving locality and unitarity. Using a lattice-level duality based on gauging $Z^{(1)}_m$, we find a dual description of this subspace, as the subspace of a charge $1/N$ gauge theory invariant under an electric one-form symmetry $Z^{(1)}_e$. We show that in this dual formulation, the chiral symmetry generator does extend unitarily to the entire Hilbert space, but has a mixed anomaly with the $Z^{(1)}_e$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Constraining a de Broglie-Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the non-standard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce, $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anti-correlation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>A Hall viscosity for skyrmion via magnon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a Hall viscosity term directly from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), that breaks parity symmetry, in the skyrmion motion of insulating magnets by time-averaging the magnon contribution to all orders. The viscosity term is proportional to the skyrmion charge. Skyrmion Hall angle shows significant dependence on the skyrmion shape and size, the ratio of exchange over DMI parameters, while roughly independent of the Gilbert damping parameter. The Hall angles have the same magnitude for opposite skyrmion charges. We speculate a velocity-dependent Hall viscosity contribution to seek asymmetric Hall angles for the opposite charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the latest results from our ongoing lattice field theory investigations of maximally supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory in three space-time dimensions, focusing on its non-perturbative phase diagram. Exploiting a lattice formulation that preserves a subset of the supersymmetry algebra at non-zero lattice spacing, we study the 'spatial deconfinement' phase transition that holography relates to the transition between localized and homogeneous black branes in the dual quantum gravity. Fixing $N_L^2 \times 8$ lattice volumes and N=8 colors in the SU(N) gauge group, we consider four aspect ratios $\alpha = N_L / N_T \leq 4$ corresponding to $N_L = 16$, $20$, $24$ and $32$. The transition temperatures we determine are in good agreement with the low-temperature, large-N holographic expectation $T_c \propto \alpha^3$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical and dynamical stability of Einstein-Maxwell and extremal Einstein-Born-Infeld thin shells in $(2\ \mathbf{+}\ 1)$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of thin shells in (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes composed of an inner anti-de Sitter (AdS) region and an outer region described by a charged Ba\~nados--Teitelboim--Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime, sourced either by Einstein--Maxwell theory (Maxwell-BTZ) or Einstein--Born--Infeld theory (BI-BTZ). Assuming a fixed charge-to-mass ratio and modeling the shell's matter with a linear equation of state, we introduce a convenient parametrization to analyze the dynamical stability configurations. We find that Maxwell-BTZ thin shells admit a wider range of dynamically stable configurations compared to BI-BTZ thin shells. We also derive the thermodynamics of the shell matter, obtaining physically meaningful entropy functions in both cases, and examine the conditions for thermodynamical stability. In the Maxwell-BTZ case, we identify regions in the parameter space where configurations are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable. In contrast, for extremal BI-BTZ thin shells, all thermodynamically stable configurations are contained within the dynamically stable ones, and shells with a linear equation of state are always dynamically stable. This work extends the understanding of thin shell configurations in lower-dimensional gravity and elucidates the interplay between dynamics, thermodynamics, and nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Dipole Portal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino dipole portal (NDP) is a minimal and predictive extension of the Standard Model, in which a transition magnetic moment operator couples an active neutrino to a heavy neutral lepton via the electromagnetic field. This higher-dimensional interaction gives rise to distinctive processes such as neutrino up-scattering, radiative decays, meson transitions, and modifications of recoil spectra, offering multiple avenues for discovery. In this review, we discuss the theoretical foundations of the NDP, its ultraviolet completions, and the associated production and decay mechanisms across laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological settings. Current constraints arise from accelerator searches, recoil-based detectors, collider studies, and high energy neutrino observatories, complemented by robust bounds from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and supernova cooling. Future experimental and observational efforts, including next-generation neutrino experiments, multi-ton dark matter detectors, and improved cosmological and astrophysical probes, are anticipated to test the remaining allowed regions. The NDP thus provides a simple, well-motivated, and broadly testable framework at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigorous analysis is presented for the entanglement spectrum of quantum many-body states possessing a higher-form group-representation symmetry generated by topological Wilson loops, which is generally non-invertible. A general framework based on elementary algebraic topology and category theory is developed to determine the block structure of reduced density matrices for arbitrary bipartite manifolds on which the states are defined. Within this framework, we scrutinize the impact of topology on the entanglement structure for low-dimensional manifolds, including especially the torus, the Klein bottle, and lens spaces. By further incorporating gauge invariance, we refine our framework to determine the entanglement structure for topological gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, in two dimensions, it is shown for the Kitaev quantum double model that not only the topological entanglement entropy can be reproduced, but also the Li-Haldane conjecture concerning the full entanglement spectrum holds exactly.</description>

      <title>Causality as a guiding principle for physics beyond General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is situated within the context of quantum gravity, broadly understood as any effort to explore the interplay between gravitation and the quantum realm, without necessarily requiring the quantization of the gravitational field itself. We focus on emergent theories, particularly those in which the causal structure and geometric concepts underlying the gravitational field in General Relativity are not fundamental but instead arise from more basic underlying degrees of freedom. Our attention is directed toward emergent approaches inspired by condensed matter physics. Rather than developing a full-fledged emergent theory and analyzing its detailed consequences, this work offers a concise roadmap of analyses and reflections relevant to emergent frameworks, without committing to any specific model. The thesis is divided into two parts, reflecting the distinct tools and analyses employed in each. The first addresses fundamental and conceptual aspects of emergent theories, focusing on the role of background structures, both regarding their implications for the theory and their constructive relevance. The second assumes the absence of singularities and horizons, a feature often expected in emergent frameworks, though the analyses remain agnostic and independent of specific theoretical commitments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant simple model of galaxy dynamics obtained by applying the Dressing Field Method (DFM) to a general-relativistic system comprising the metric and four scalar fields, phenomenologically representing the four-velocity of a cosmological fluid or dust field. The DFM, a systematic tool for extracting the gauge-invariant content in general-relativistic theories, provides a physical coordinatization that yields corrective terms to the rotational velocity profile. These corrections produce galaxy rotation curves that combine a Keplerian and a constant velocity terms, effectively emulating a Dark Matter contribution. We compare DFM-derived rotation curves to observed data for spiral galaxies, from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database, showing that the DFM allows to fit them well.</description>

      <title>The Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter:connecting precision muon physics, cosmology, and colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter (MPVDM), a minimal yet phenomenologically rich extension of the Standard Model featuring a new SU(2)_D gauge symmetry and vector-like muons. In this framework the dark sector interacts with the Standard Model only through these heavy leptons, linking dark matter and the muon sector. The MPVDM can simultaneously explain the observed relic abundance and the muon anomalous magnetic moment a_mu under both the "tension" and "compatibility" scenarios motivated by recent (g-2)_mu results. A key finding is a generic off-resonance velocity suppression mechanism that allows light (&lt;1 GeV) vector dark matter to evade CMB limits near 2*m_DM ~ m_H_D. Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner resonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the temperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned near resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the required CMB era suppression without fine tuning. A five dimensional parameter scan shows that the tension scenario requires sub GeV dark matter with g_D ~ 1e-3 and TeV scale vector like muons, while the compatibility scenario admits a broad mass range up to multi TeV. Recasting ATLAS and CMS searches for mu+ mu- + E_T^miss sets a lower bound of about 850 GeV on vector like muons. The MPVDM thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally accessible framework linking dark matter and muon physics across cosmological and collider frontiers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical and quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with Lie groups is hindered by the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of gauge degrees of freedom. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. X 15, 031065 (2025)], we introduced a new truncation scheme -- here renamed as Renormalized Dual Basis (RDB) -- based on the resolution of the single-plaquette problem, and demonstrated its performance for SU(2) LGTs. In this paper, we apply the RDB to compact quantum electrodynamics (cQED) in three spacetime dimensions (2+1D). We variationally determine the ground state of the theory for small lattices with periodic (for pure gauge) and open (in presence of fermionic matter) boundary conditions, achieving improved precision for the plaquette operator compared to previous approaches. By leveraging tensor networks, we extend the study to larger lattices and demonstrate the scalability of the method. Overall, we show that the RDB provides an efficient description across all coupling regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geodesic structure and observable properties of asymptotically flat regular black holes sourced by a phantom scalar field characterized by a scalar charge $A$. This parameter removes the central singularity and continuously deforms the Schwarzschild geometry. The equations of motion for test particles and photons are derived, and the resulting null geodesics are analyzed, including the deflection of light, gravitational time delay, and redshift, in order to constrain $A$ using classical Solar System tests. These observations impose stringent limits on the scalar charge, confirming that $A$ must remain extremely small in the weak-field regime to ensure full consistency with general relativity. In the strong-field regime, we compute the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ associated with the photon sphere and establish its exact relations with the critical impact parameter $\mathcal{B}_u$ and the angular size of the shadow $\alpha_{\mathrm{sh}}$, given by $\mathcal{B}_u = 1/|\lambda|$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{sh}} = 1/(r_{0}|\lambda|)$. These correspondences reveal that the dynamical instability of null circular orbits governs the optical appearance of the black hole. Our results show that increasing $A$ reduces the instability of photon trajectories and enlarges the angular size of the shadow, indicating that the regularization scale leaves a distinct observational imprint on the geometry of regular black holes. In addition, constraints derived from Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87* and Sgr A* further restrict the allowed range of the scalar charge, reinforcing the consistency of the model with current astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Globalization of perturbative Chern-Simons theory on the moduli space of flat connections in the BV formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the perturbative path integral of Chern-Simons theory (the effective BV action on zero-modes) in Lorenz gauge, expanded around a (possibly non-acyclic) flat connection, as a family over the smooth irreducible stratum $\mathcal{M}' \subset \mathcal{M}$ of the moduli space of flat connections. We prove that it is horizontal with respect to the Grothendieck connection up to a BV-exact term. From it, we construct a volume form on $\mathcal{M'}$ - the "global partition function" - whose cohomology class is independent of the metric, and so is a 3-manifold invariant.
  As an element of the construction, we construct an extension of the perturbative partition function to a nonhomogeneous form on the space of triples $(A,A',g)$ consisting of (1) a "kinetic" flat connection $A$ around which Chern-Simons action is expanded, (2) a "gauge-fixing" flat connection $A'$, (3) a metric $g$. This extension is horizontal with respect to an appropriate Gauss-Manin superconnection (which involves the BV operator as a degree zero component).</description>

      <title>Decay of uniformly rotating particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the interpretation of the circular Unruh effect. To this aim, we rely on the principle of general covariance applied to the decay properties of non-inertial particles. Specifically, we show how the tree-level decay rate of an inverse-$\beta$ process involving scalar fields does not require the introduction of a thermal (or non-thermal) bath in the comoving frame to be a scalar under general coordinate transformations. Instead, we interpret any decay process as an emission of negative-energy quanta, whose existence is motivated by the absence of a global vacuum state for uniformly rotating observers. This implies that, in principle, no uniformly rotating particle can be regarded as stable.</description>

      <title>Modulated symmetries from generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries rigidly delimit the landscape of quantum matter. Recently uncovered spatially modulated symmetries, whose actions vary with position, enable excitations with restricted mobility, while Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type anomalies impose sharp constraints on which lattice phases are realizable. In one dimensional a spin chain, gauging procedures have linked modulated symmetry to LSM type anomaly, but a general understanding beyond 1D remains incomplete. We show that spatially modulated symmetries and their associated dipole algebras naturally emerge from gauging ordinary symmetries in the presence of generalized LSM type anomalies. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and develop complementary field theoretic descriptions in arbitrary spatial dimensions that connect LSM anomaly inflow to higher-group symmetry structures governing the modulated symmetries. Our results provide a unified, nonperturbative framework that ties together LSM constraints and spatially modulated symmetries across dimensions.</description>

      <title>Loading the stable photon sphere in Weyl conformal gravity metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the accumulation of null matter at the stable photon sphere in the Mannheim-Kazanas metric, the analogue to the Schwarzschild solution in Weyl's conformal theory of gravity. In our toy problem in which we consider an infinitely-thin shell, we find that a jump in radial pressure ${T^r}_r$ is induced across the shell unless the shell has a radius of either the unstable or stable photon sphere radii. We then find that upon loading the stable photon sphere, its area remains invariant. Furthermore, at a critical threshold loading limit for this zero-width null matter shell, we are able to produce a metric containing an extremal horizon with an AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ geometry completely independent of the cosmological curvature. This hitherto unencountered and therefore unexpected result is a phenomenon unseen in standard nonconformal second-order metrics with nonzero cosmological constants.</description>

      <title>Fermi arcs for generic nodal points hosting monopoles or dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi arcs represent the surface states at the boundary of a three-dimensional topological semimetal with the vacuum, illustrating the notion of bulk-boundary correspondence playing out in real materials. Their special character is tied up with the topological charges carried by the nodes of the semimetal in the momentum space, where two or more bands cross. In fact, they are constrained to begin and end on the perimeters of the projections of the Fermi surfaces of the bands tangentially, signalling their mixing with the bulk states. The number of Fermi arcs grazing onto the tangents of the outermost projection about a given node also reflects the magnitude of the charge at the node (equalling the Berry-curvature monopole), revealing the intrinsic topology of the underlying bandstructure, which can be visualised in experiments like ARPES. Here we take upon the task of unambiguously characterising the analytical structure of these states for generic nodal points, (1) whose degeneracy might be twofold or multifold; and (2) the associated bands might exhibit isotropic or anisotropic, linear- or nonlinear-in-momentum dispersion. Moreover, we also address the question of whether we should get any Fermi arcs at all for topological nodes carrying zero values of monopoles, but representing ideal dipoles.</description>

      <title>Growth and collapse of subsystem complexity under random unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For chaotic quantum dynamics modeled by random unitary circuits, we study the complexity of reduced density matrices of subsystems as a function of evolution time where the initial global state is a product state. The state complexity is defined as the minimum number of local quantum channels to generate a given state from a product state to a good approximation. In $1+1$d, we prove that the complexity of subsystems of length $\ell$ smaller than half grows linearly in time $T$ at least up to $T = \ell / 4$ but becomes zero after time $T = \ell /2$ in the limit of a large local dimension, while the complexity of the complementary subsystem of length larger than half grows linearly in time up to exponentially late times. Using holographic correspondence, we give some evidence that the state complexity of the smaller subsystem should actually grow linearly up to time $T = \ell/2$ and then abruptly decay to zero.</description>

Abstract: We investigate decoherence mechanisms in open quantum systems using quantum field theory techniques and the quantum Boltzmann equation. Specifically, we focus on decoherence through Bremsstrahlung emission, a fundamental process in quantum electrodynamics leading to coherence loss. By applying quantum field theory techniques and quantum Boltzmann equation, we model the fermion-photon interaction in the Stern-Gerlach interferometer and analyze the induced dephasing factor. Our approach offers significant advancements in understanding decoherence and its potential applications in quantum sensing and atomic interferometry. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method by comparing results to classical Bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <title>Can black holes evaporate past extremality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes with sufficiently large initial charge and mass will Hawking-evaporate towards the extremal limit. The emission slows as the temperature approaches zero, but still reaches the point where a single Hawking quantum would make the object superextremal, removing the horizon. We take this semiclassical prediction at face value and ask: When the emission occurs, what is revealed? Using a model of thin-shell collapse with subsequent accretion/evaporation by a null flux of ingoing positive/negative energy (charged Vaidya spacetime glued to a flat interior), we find two possible outcomes: (i) For shells that are initially very tightly bound, a timelike singularity forms and later appears; or (ii) for unbound or modestly bound shells, the matter re-emerges as a null shell that expands to infinity. This expanding remnant has been bathed in the ingoing Hawking quanta during evaporation and presumably carries correlations with the outgoing quanta, offering the attractive possibility of studying information paradox issues in a setup where spacetime curvatures are globally small, so that quantum gravity is not required. Even for ordinary black holes that evaporate down to the Planck size, we propose a radical new scenario for the interior: rather than forming a singularity, the collapsing matter settles onto an \textit{outgoing} null trajectory \textit{inside} the horizon for the entirety of evaporation.</description>

We provide a classical-simulator based proof-of-concept by computing the charm-to-charmonium fragmentation, $c\to J/\psi$, in a simplified setup, an interesting case where we can (reasonably) compare with the known 1993 perturbative evaluation within Nonrelativistic QCD.</description>

Abstract: We present the first computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) pure QED and mixed QCD$\otimes$QED corrections to unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Building on our previous NNLO QCD results, these corrections are crucial for improving the theoretical precision. The coefficient functions are derived within the QCD factorization framework using dimensional regularization, with consistent renormalization and mass factorization. A detailed phenomenological analysis shows that the NNLO QED and QCD$\otimes$QED terms enhance perturbative stability and reduce scale uncertainties. These results are essential for high-precision SIDIS predictions at future facilities such as the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

Abstract: Recent Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories and determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. A byproduct of our analysis is the bulk viscosity that follows from the holographic V-QCD theory. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data. We investigate possible resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical effective action in string theory is background-independent, and its invariance under the Buscher rules constrains its form up to a few parameters. This work investigates how this picture changes at the quantum level, where loop corrections introduce an inherent background dependence. We propose a T-duality map for the loop-level effective action. It connects the circle-reduced effective action at large radius, where loops include only Kaluza-Klein (KK) momentum modes, to the base-space effective action at small radius, where loops include only winding modes. The resulting effective action is fundamentally distinct: it cannot be obtained from the KK reduction of any standard higher-dimensional action, revealing a uniquely stringy phenomenon at the loop level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1914, Ramanujan unveiled 17 extraordinary infinite series for $1/\pi$. In this work, we uncover their physics origin by relating them to 2D logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs), which emerge in diverse settings such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, percolation, polymers, and even holography. Through this LCFT connection, we reinterpret such infinite series in terms of fundamental CFT data -- the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients. This perspective leads to novel physics-inspired approximations for $1/\pi$. Drawing lessons from Ramanujan's formulae, we construct a new family of bases for expanding LCFT correlators that converge far more rapidly than the standard conformal block decomposition. This is achieved using recently developed stringy/parametric crossing-symmetric dispersion relations. Remarkably, when working with these new expansions, the action of a certain differential operator (which arises naturally from the Ramanujan connection) dramatically enhances convergence, with the entire contribution collapsing to that of the logarithmic identity operator. This striking simplification hints at a universal property of LCFTs. Finally, we discuss a new holographic interpretation of this unexpected mathematics-physics connection.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple model of two-dimensional N=2 superconformal mechanics with a spin-orbit interaction term and demonstrate that it inherits the Galilean symmetry of the initial free-particle system. We then propose a quaternionic counterpart of this system, which describes the four-dimensional N=4 superconformal mechanics$D(1,2|\alpha). The bosonic part of the Hamiltonian describes a free particle on the cone, while the fermionic part necessarily includes the spin-orbit interaction term.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric localisation of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories on a spindle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric field theories living on a weighted projective space $\mathbb{WCP}_{[n_1,n_2]}^1$, often referred to as a spindle. Starting from the spindle solution of five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, we construct a theory on a spindle which preserves supersymmetry via the anti-twist mechanism and admits two Killing spinors of opposite $R$-charge. We apply the technique of supersymmetric localisation to compute the exact partition function for a theory consisting of an abelian vector multiplet and a chiral multiplet, finding that the path integral localises to a real moduli space of vector multiplet fluctuations. We compute the one-loop determinants via the equivariant index, using both the method of unpaired eigenvalues and the fixed point theorem, finding agreement between the two approaches. We conclude with the explicit partition function for an example of a charged chiral multiplet in the presence of a Fayet-Iliopoulos term and comment on its dependence on the overall length scale of the geometry. This work paves the way towards uncovering two-dimensional dualities, such as mirror symmetry, for field theories defined on orbifold backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scalar field theory on biregular trees, as a new model for discrete holography. Biregular trees are discrete symmetric spaces associated with the bulk isometry group SU(3) over the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. The bulk-to-bulk and bulk-to-boundary propagators exhibit distinct features absent on the regular tree or continuum AdS spaces, arising from the semihomogeneous nature of the bulk space. We compute the two- and three-point correlators of the putative boundary dual. The three-point correlator exhibits a nontrivial "tensor structure" via dependence on the homogeneity degree of a unique bulk point specified in terms of boundary insertion points. The computed OPE coefficients show dependence on zeta functions associated with the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. This work initiates the formulation of holography on a family of discrete holographic spaces that exhibit features of both flat space and negatively curved space.</description>

Abstract: Neural Network (NN) architectures that break statistical independence of parameters have been proposed as a new approach for simulating local quantum field theories (QFTs). In the infinite neuron number limit, single-layer NNs can exactly reproduce QFT results. This paper examines the viability of this architecture for perturbative calculations of local QFTs for finite neuron number $N$ using scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions as an example. We find that the renormalized $O(1/N)$ corrections to two- and four-point correlators yield perturbative series which are sensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off and therefore have a weak convergence. We propose a modification to the architecture to improve this convergence and discuss constraints on the parameters of the theory and the scaling of N which allow us to extract accurate field theory results.</description>

Abstract: It has recently been shown that the Nambu-Goto equation for a string emerges from the junction conditions in three-dimensional gravity. Holographically, gravitational junctions are dual to interfaces in conformal field theory. We demonstrate that each stringy mode of the junction corresponds to a universal $\mathcal{H}_{in}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{out}$ quantum map between in and out Hilbert spaces of excitations scattered at the interface, and also a universal $\mathcal{H}_{L}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{R}$ quantum map relating the excitations on both sides. These quantum maps generalize those realized by defect operators, preserve the conformal boundary condition at the interface, and realize a tunable energy transmitter.</description>

      <title>The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Spin-3/2 Particles During Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the density of a spin-$\frac32$ particle, the raritron, produced at the end of inflation due to gravitational interactions. We consider a background inflaton condensate as the source of this production, mediated by the exchange of a graviton. This production greatly exceeds the gravitational production from the emergent thermal bath during reheating. The relic abundance limit sets an absolute minimum mass for a stable raritron, though there are also model dependent constraints imposed by unitarity. We also examine the case of gravitational production of a gravitino, taking into account the goldstino evolution during reheating. We compare these results with conventional gravitino production mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation for a generic (typically mixed) qubit-qudit state, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This represents the optimal (2-2-2) Bell nonlocality for this kind of systems. The work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis result for a qubit-qubit setup. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation. We apply our general results to address a number of issues, namely, we obtain a bound on the degree of purity required in a system to exhibit nonlocality and study the statistics of nonlocality in random density matrices. In addition, we show the impossibility of improving the amount of CHSH violation by embedding the qudit in a Hilbert space of larger dimension. Finally, the general result is illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories. Nevertheless, our results can be used to analyze and interpret memory effects from numerical-relativity simulations of binaries in this theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04442v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production rate of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry remains largely unexplored. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. In particular, we show that, while the cumulative AFL entropy generally saturates to the dimensional bound at late times for chaotic dynamics, this saturation value is distinctively lower when the measurements respect the symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the crucial role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is readily adaptable for investigating symmetry's influence across diverse probes of quantum chaos.</description>

Abstract: The Burkhardt--Cottingham sum rule is an exact superconvergence relation for a spin-structure function, derived from general principles of light absorption and scattering, and valid at any momentum transfer $Q^2$. I illustrate how a class of such relations emerges from the Siegert point, an unphysical kinematical point where both the probe and the target are at rest. From light-by-light scattering, new sum rules for $\gamma^\ast \gamma^\ast$ fusion are emerging, valid for arbitrary photon virtualities. Regarding the convergence of these relations, there is a simple argument for the suppression of longitudinal photon polarizations at high energy. Among its consequences is the prediction of $\sigma_L/ \sigma_T \to 0$ at high energy, for the ratio of unpolarized nucleon photoabsorption cross sections.</description>

      <title>The Weyl Geometric Gravity black hole in light of the Solar System tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate, respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general relativity (gravitational redshift, the E\"{o}tv\"{o}s parameter and the universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.</description>

Abstract: We construct four-dimensional gravity theories that resolve the Schwarzschild singularity and enable dynamical studies of nonsingular gravitational collapse. The construction employs a class of nonpolynomial curvature invariants that produce actions with (i) second-order equations of motion in spherical symmetry and (ii) a Birkhoff theorem, ensuring uniqueness of the spherically symmetric solution. Upon spherical reduction to two dimensions, these theories map to a particular subclass of Horndeski scalar-tensor models, which we use to explicitly verify the formation of regular black holes as the byproduct of the collapse of pressureless stars and thin-shells. We also show that linear perturbations on top of maximally symmetric backgrounds are governed by second-order equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of particle physics is usually cast in symmetry-first terms. Recently, a geometry-first picture has been proposed, in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. In this paper I extend this approach to two central mechanisms of the standard model: spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Yukawa coupling, both essential for particles to acquire mass. These reformulations offer alternative explanations cast in purely geometric terms. For example, a particle's quantum numbers correspond to the internal space it inhabits and to the geometric type of object it is (e.g. an $(n,m)$-tensor). I argue that a symmetry-first account in terms of principal and associated bundles admits a genuine geometry-first counterpart only when the group's representation coincides with the automorphism group of the fibre -- a condition that cuts the slack tolerated by the symmetry-first view.</description>

Abstract: This paper constructs the cohomology theory for grading-restricted vertex superalgebras, generalizing Yi-Zhi Huang's cohomology theory of grading-restricted vertex algebras. To simplify the discussion, motivate the construction, and make it easier for the reader to understand the technical points, we also include the construction of the cohomology theory of supercommutative associative algebras, a generalization of the Harrison cohomology theory of a commutative algebra that has not been explicitly written down. The paper will serve as the foundation for many subsequent studies, especially, the deformation theory of vertex superalgebras.</description>
