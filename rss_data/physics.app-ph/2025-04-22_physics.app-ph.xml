      <title>Partition laser assembling technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of micro/nanofabrication techniques with high throughput, efficiency, and flexibility is critical for fields like integrated photonics, biosensing, and medical diagnostics. This study presents Partition Laser Assembling (PLA), a novel laser technique for fabricating complex micro/nanostructures akin to puzzle pieces. By dividing the target patterns described by scalable vector graphics into partitions, any structures in each partition can be fabricated via structured lights as "light stamp" through spatial light modulation. Unlike traditional direct laser writing, PLA eliminates reliance on mechanical components, avoiding step-like artifacts and ensuring smoother fabrication of complex micro/nanostructures. By seamlessly assembling basic shapes, PLA achieves intricate structures like micro artworks and metalenses with unmatched precision and resolution. Leveraging two-photon fabrication, PLA guarantees high resolution and structural integrity, positioning it as a transformative tool for nanoscale 3D printing. With applications spanning research and industry, PLA paves the way for advanced optical devices, micro/nanofabrications, and next-gen manufacturing technologies.</description>

      <title>Can we build a transistor using vacancy-induced bound states in a topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) have been considered as promising candidates for next generation of electronic devices due to their topologically protected quantum transport phenomena. In this work, a scheme for atomic-scale field effect transistor (FET) based on vacancy-induced edge states in TIs is promoted. By designing the positions of vacancies, the closed channel between source and drain terminals provided by vacancy-induced edge states can have the energy spectra with a gap between edge and bulk states. When gate terminal receive the signal, electric field applied by gate terminal can shift quasi Fermi energy of the closed channel from edge states into the gap, and hence open the channel between source and drain terminals. The energy spectra and the effect of electric field are demonstrated using Haldane model and density functional theory (DFT) respectively. This work suggest possible revolutionary applicational potentials of vacancy-induced edge states in topological insulators for atomic-scale electronics.</description>

      <title>Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed fiber lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications in precision acceleration and force sensing, as well as testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which often require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens enables stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for the collection of scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>

      <title>Rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography of the human body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging the human body's morphological and angiographic information is essential for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating medical conditions. Ultrasonography performs the morphological assessment of the soft tissue based on acoustic impedance variations, whereas photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can visualize blood vessels based on intrinsic hemoglobin absorption. Three-dimensional (3D) panoramic imaging of the vasculature is generally not practical in conventional ultrasonography with limited field-of-view (FOV) probes, and PAT does not provide sufficient scattering-based soft tissue morphological contrast. Complementing each other, fast panoramic rotational ultrasound tomography (RUST) and PAT are integrated for hybrid rotational ultrasound and photoacoustic tomography (RUS-PAT), which obtains 3D ultrasound structural and PAT angiographic images of the human body quasi-simultaneously. The RUST functionality is achieved in a cost-effective manner using a single-element ultrasonic transducer for ultrasound transmission and rotating arc-shaped arrays for 3D panoramic detection. RUST is superior to conventional ultrasonography, which either has a limited FOV with a linear array or is high-cost with a hemispherical array that requires both transmission and receiving. By switching the acoustic source to a light source, the system is conveniently converted to PAT mode to acquire angiographic images in the same region. Using RUS-PAT, we have successfully imaged the human head, breast, hand, and foot with a 10 cm diameter FOV, submillimeter isotropic resolution, and 10 s imaging time for each modality. The 3D RUS-PAT is a powerful tool for high-speed, 3D, dual-contrast imaging of the human body with potential for rapid clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Two-step laser resonant ionization spectroscopy of chromium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At TRIUMF's off-line laser ion source test stand, stepwise resonant laser ionization spectroscopy of chromium (Cr) was carried out, to find an efficient ionization scheme suitable for titanium sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser systems. With three different first-excitation transitions, 357.971 nm, 359.451 nm, and 360.636 nm, automated continuous laser-frequency scans using a frequency-doubled, grating-tuned Ti:Sa laser were performed. Rydberg series as well as autoionizing(AI) states were observed. From these results, the ionization potential (IP) of Cr was determined as 54575.49(2)$_\text{stat}$(2)$_\text{sys}$ cm$^{-1}$, which is one order of magnitude more precise than the previously reported 54575.6(3) cm$^{-1}$ in NIST database. The ionization scheme using the observed AI resonance, with 357.971 nm as the first step and 373.935 nm as the second step was subsequently deployed to the online delivery of radioactive Cr isotope beams for precision mass measurements. The online yields of $^{50-59}$Cr have been measured at TRIUMF-ISAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the demand for high-speed response in display and VLC applications, a more detailed study of the capacitive effects in LEDs is required. This work tested the capacitance of LEDs at different frequencies and proposed an effective circuit model, which achieved a good fit to the frequency dispersion observed in the experimental results. Additionally, it was determined that the low-frequency 1/f capacitance originates from the metal-semiconductor interface.</description>

      <title>Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency (fT) and power gain cutoff frequency (fmax) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/$\mathrm{mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/$\mathrm{mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz with power consumption &lt; 200 mW/mm, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly 100$\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF MOSFETs. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve 64 mW/mm output power and 11 dB power gain in the K-band, marking a significant milestone in flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Low damped acoustic modes in polycrystalline nickel cavities fabricated by ps-laser delamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-shot picosecond (ps) laser induced delamination allows for the direct generation of suspended membranes from a continuous metallic film. It is not known if polycrystalline membranes obtained by local ps-pulsed laser delamination of a continuous film on a substrate would show low damping compared to the film. Here, we report on the dynamics of acoustic waves excited by femtosecond light pulses and confined in a single freestanding nickel layer, acting as an acoustic cavity. By combining Fourier transform analysis of the measured pump-probe signal and numerical multi-physics simulations, we show that high-frequency (&gt; 10 GHz) longitudinal acoustic pulses can resonate inside the cavity and display lower damping compared to a reference nickel film on SiO2 substrate given that the conditions of total internal reflection are nearly met in the cavity, even if these cavities display more defects in terms of crystal structure and surface roughness. This result provides evidence that the ps-laser induced local delamination could be effectively utilized, after further optimization, as a flexible process to design on-demand micro-structured systems for opto-acoustic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>
