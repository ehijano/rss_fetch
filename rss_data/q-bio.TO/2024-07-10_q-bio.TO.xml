      <title>A reaction-diffusion model for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with a treatment term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical study for the development of multiple sclerosis based on a reaction-diffusion system. The model describes interactions among different populations of human cells, motion of immune cells stimulated by cytokines, consumption of myelin sheath due to anomalously activated lymphocytes and its restoration by oligodendrocytes. Successively, we introduce a therapy term representing injection of low-dose IL-2 interleukine. A natural step is then to study the system, investigating the formation of spatial patterns by means of a Turing instability analysis of the problem. In particular, we get spatial patterns oscillating in time that may reproduce brain lesions characteristic of the early stage of the pathology, in both non-treatment and treatment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Src Kinase Slows Collective Rotation of Confined Epithelial Cell Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective cell migration is key during development, wound healing and metastasis and relies on coordinated cell behaviors at the group level. Src kinase is a signalling enzyme regulating many cellular processes including adhesion and motility and its deregulated activation has been associated to aggressiveness of different cancers. Here, we take advantage of optogenetics to precisely control Src activation in time to study the effect of its over activation on collective rotation of confined monolayers. We show that Src activation slows down collective rotation of epithelial cells confined into circular adhesive patches. We interpret velocity, force and stress data during period of non-activation and period of activation of Src thanks to an hydrodynamic description of the cell assembly as a polar active fluid. Src activation leads to a 2-fold decrease in the ratio of polar angle to friction, which could result from increased adhesive bonds at the cell-substrate interface. Our work reveals the importance of fine-tuning the level of Src activity for coordinated collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Phyllotaxis revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1641</link>
      <description>arXiv:1201.1641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jean's `Fundamental Theorem of Phyllotaxis' (\emph{Phyllotaxis: a systematic study in Plant Morphogenesis}, CUP 1994) describes the relationship between the count numbers of observed spirals in cylindrical lattices and the horizontal angle between vertically successive spots in the lattice. It is indeed fundamental to observational studies of phyllotactic counts, and especially to the evaluation of hypotheses about the origin of Fibonacci structure within lattices. Unfortunately the textbook version of the theorem is incomplete in that it is incorrect for an important special case. This paper provides a complete statement and proof of the Theorem.</description>
