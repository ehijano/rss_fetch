      <title>On smooth infinite dimensional grassmannians, splittings and non-commutative generalized cross-ratio mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe basic diffeological structures related to splittings and Grassmannians for infinite dimensional vector spaces. We analyze and expand the notion of non-commutative cross-ratio and prove its smoothness. Then we illustrate this theory by examples, with some of them extracted from the existing literature related to infinite dimensional (Banach) Grassmannians, and others where the diffeological setting is a key primary step for rigorous definitions.</description>

      <title>Killing Fields on Compact m-Quasi-Einstein Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given a compact, connected $m$-quasi Einstein manifold $(M,g,X)$ without boundary, the potential vector field $X$ is Killing if and only if $(M, g)$ has constant scalar curvature. This extends a result of Bahuaud-Gunasekaran-Kunduri-Woolgar, where it is shown that $X$ is Killing if $X$ is incompressible. We also provide a sufficient condition for a compact, non-gradient $m$-quasi Einstein metric to admit a Killing field. We do this by following a technique of Dunajski and Lucietti, who prove that a Killing field always exists in this case when $m=2$. This condition provides an alternate proof of the aforementioned result of Bahuaud-Gunasekaran-Kunduri-Woolgar. This alternate proof works in the $m = -2$ case as well, which was not covered in the original proof.</description>

      <title>Global existence and geometry of constant mass aspect function foliation in perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constant mass function foliation has been shown useful for studying the null Penrose inequality on a null hypersurface, because of the monotonicity formula of Hawking mass along such a foliation. In this paper, we show the global existence of the constant mass aspect function foliation on a nearly spherically symmetric incoming null hypersurface, emanating from a spacelike surface near the apparent horizon to the past null infinity in a vacuum perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime. Moreover, we study the geometry of the constant mass aspect function foliation, by comparing with the spherically symmetric foliation in the Schwarzschild spacetime. The knowledge about the geometry of the foliation is essential for investigating the perturbation of the constant mass aspect function foliation, which is the core in the application to the null Penrose inequality for a vacuum perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian homogeneous structures with indecomposable holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Lorentzian homogeneous space, we study how algebraic conditions on the isotropy group affect the geometry and curvature of the homogeneous space. More specifically, we prove that a Lorentzian locally homogeneous space is locally isometric to a plane wave if it admits an Ambrose--Singer connection with indecomposable, non-irreducible holonomy. This generalises several existing results that require a certain algebraic type of the torsion of the Ambrose--Singer connection and moreover is in analogy to the fact that a Lorentzian homogeneous space with irreducible isotropy has constant sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Manin pairs and moment maps revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of quasi-Poisson $G$-spaces with $D/G$-valued moment maps was introduced by Alekseev and Kosmann-Schwarzbach in 1999. Our main result is a \emph{Lifting Theorem}, establishing a bijective correspondence between the categories of quasi-Poisson $G$-spaces with $D/G$-valued moment maps and of quasi-Poisson $G\times G$-spaces with $D$-valued moment maps. Using this result, we give simple constructions of fusion and conjugation for these spaces, and new examples coming from moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of spin fill-ins with non-negative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new mean curvature rigidity theorems of spin fill-ins with non-negative scalar curvature using two different spinorial techniques. Our results address two questions by Miao and Gromov, respectively. The first technique is based on extending boundary spinors satisfying a generalized eigenvalue equation via the Fredholm alternative for an APS boundary value problem, while the second is a comparison result in the spirit of Llarull and Lott using index theory. We also show that the latter implies a new Witten-type integral inequality for the mass of an asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold which holds even when the scalar curvature is not assumed to be non-negative.</description>

Abstract: We prove that in any fixed dimension, K-semistable log Fano cone singularities whose volumes are bounded from below by a fixed positive number form a bounded set. As a consequence, we show that the set of local volumes of klt singularities of a fixed dimension has zero as the only accumulation point.</description>

      <title>Interior regularity of area minimizing currents within a $C^{2,\alpha}$-submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an area-minimizing integral $m$-current in $\Sigma$, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the interior singular set of $T$ cannot exceed $m-2$, provided that $\Sigma$ is an embedded $(m+\bar{n})$-submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$ of class $C^{2,\alpha}$, where $\alpha&gt;0$. This result establishes the complete counterpart, in the arbitrary codimension setting, of the interior regularity theory for area-minimizing integral hypercurrents within a Riemannian manifold of class $C^{2,\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>On the Meaning of Local Symmetries: Epistemic-Ontological Dialectic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose our account of the meaning of local symmetries. We argue that the general covariance principle and gauge principle both are principles of democratic epistemic access to the law of physics, leading to ontological insights about the objective nature of spacetime. We further argue that relationality is a core notion of general-relativistic gauge field theory, tacitly encoded by its (active) local symmetries.</description>

      <title>A volume-renormalized mass for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a geometric quantity for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, which we call the volume-renormalized mass. It is essentially a linear combination of the ADM mass surface integral and a renormalization of the volume.
  We show that the volume-renormalized mass is well-defined and diffeomorphism invariant under weaker fall-off conditions than required to ensure that the renormalized volume and the ADM mass surface integral are well-defined separately. We prove several positivity results for the volume-renormalized mass. We also use it to define a renormalized Einstein--Hilbert action and a renormalized expander entropy which is nondecreasing under the Ricci flow. Further, we show that local maximizers of the entropy are local minimizers of the volume-renormalized mass.</description>

      <title>Are all Weakly Convex and Decomposable Polyhedral Surfaces Infinitesimally Rigid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is conjectured that all decomposable (i.e. interior can be triangulated without adding new vertices) polyhedra with vertices in convex position are infinitesimally rigid and only recently has it been shown that this is indeed true under an additional assumption of codecomposability (i.e. the interior of the difference between the convex hull and the polyhedron itself can be triangulated without adding new vertices).
  One major set of tools for studying infinitesimal rigidity happens to be throughout the (negative) Hessian $M_T$ of the discrete Hilbert-Einstein functional. Besides its theoretical importance, it provides the necessary machinery to tackle the problem experimentally. To search for potential counterexamples to the conjecture, one constructs an explicit family of so-called $T$-polyhedra, all of which are weakly convex and decomposable, while being non-codecomposable. Since infinitesimal rigidity is equivalent to a non-degenerate $M_T$, one can let Mathematica search for the eigenvalues of $M_T$ and gather experimental evidence that such a flexible, weakly convex and decomposable $T$-polyhedron may not exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the integrability to second order of the infinitesimal Einstein deformations of the symmetric metric $g$ on the complex Grassmannian of $k$-planes inside $\mathbb{C}^n$. By showing the nonvanishing of Koiso's obstruction polynomial, we characterize the infinitesimal deformations that are integrable to second order as an explicit variety inside $\mathfrak{su}(n)$. In particular we show that $g$ is isolated in the moduli space of Einstein metrics if $n$ is odd.</description>

      <title>The tangent space in sub-Finsler geometry and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tangent space to a sub-Finsler manifold in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We prove that the metric tangent is described by the nilpotent approximation, generalizing the sub-Riemannian result. Additionally, we study the blow-up of a measure on a sub-Finsler manifold. We identify the new notion of bounded measure which ensures that, in the limit, the blow-up is a scalar multiple of the Lebesgue measure. Our results have applications in the study of the Lott-Sturm-Villani curvature-dimension condition in sub-Finsler manifolds. In particular, we show the failure of the CD condition in equiregular sub-Finsler manifolds with growth vector (2,3), equipped with a bounded measure.</description>
