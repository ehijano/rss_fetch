      <title>How memories are stored in the brain: the declarative memory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to form memories is a basic feature of learning and accumulating knowledge. But where is memory information stored in the brain? Within the scientific research community, it is generally believed that memory information is stored in the synapse. However, this widely accepted dogma has been challenged by more and more evidence in recent years. In this paper, I will present a memory model, the neural circuit construction theory, created from a perspective that may completely subvert traditional thinking. Instead of looking for whether memories are stored inside neurons or in the synapses, the theory proposes that the human brain does not have any container like memory storage, rather human memory is hardwired through live wiring. The model consists of two parts, the semantic memory model and the episodic memory model.</description>

      <title>Deciphering autism heterogeneity: a molecular stratification approach in four mouse models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, as well as restrained or stereotyped behaviors. The inherent heterogeneity within the autism spectrum poses challenges for developing effective pharmacological treatments targeting core features. Successful clinical trials require the identification of robust markers to enable patient stratification. In this study, we explored molecular markers within the oxytocin and immediate early gene families across five interconnected brain structures of the social circuit in four distinct ASD mouse models, each exhibiting unique behavioral features along the autism spectrum. While dysregulations in the oxytocin family were model-specific, immediate early genes displayed widespread alterations, reflecting global changes in social plasticity. Through integrative analysis, we identified Egr1, Foxp1, Homer1a, Oxt and Oxtr as five robust and discriminant molecular markers facilitating successful stratification of the four models. Importantly, our stratification demonstrated predictive values when challenged with a fifth mouse model or identifying subgroups of mice potentially responsive to oxytocin treatment. Beyond providing insights into oxytocin and immediate early gene mRNA dynamics, this proof-of-concept study represents a significant step toward potential stratification of individuals with ASD. The implications extend to enhancing the success of clinical trials and guiding personalized medicine for distinct subgroups of individuals with autism.</description>

      <title>Confidence and second-order errors in cortical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimization of cortical prediction errors has been considered a key computational goal of the cerebral cortex underlying perception, action and learning. However, it is still unclear how the cortex should form and use information about uncertainty in this process. Here, we formally derive neural dynamics that minimize prediction errors under the assumption that cortical areas must not only predict the activity in other areas and sensory streams but also jointly project their confidence (inverse expected uncertainty) in their predictions. In the resulting neuronal dynamics, the integration of bottom-up and top-down cortical streams is dynamically modulated based on confidence in accordance with the Bayesian principle. Moreover, the theory predicts the existence of cortical second-order errors, comparing confidence and actual performance. These errors are propagated through the cortical hierarchy alongside classical prediction errors and are used to learn the weights of synapses responsible for formulating confidence. We propose a detailed mapping of the theory to cortical circuitry, discuss entailed functional interpretations and provide potential directions for experimental work.</description>
