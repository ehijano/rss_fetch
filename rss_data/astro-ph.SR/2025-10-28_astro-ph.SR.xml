      <title>SPYGLASS. VII-A. The Demographics and Ages of Small Nearby Young Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Gaia-based young stellar association surveys have revealed dozens of low-mass populations that have, until recently, been too small or sparse to detect. These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $&lt;20$ $M_{\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 9 $M_{\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1 to 42.8 $\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Biennial Oscillations and Rieger-type Periodicities in a Babcock-Leighton Solar Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's magnetic field shows the 11-year solar cycle and shorter periodicities, popularly known as the quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) and Rieger-type periods, or ``season of the Sun." Although several theories have been proposed to explain the origin of QBOs and Rieger-type periods, no single theory has widespread acceptance. We explore whether the \bl\ dynamo can produce Rieger-type periodicity and QBOs and investigate their underlying physical mechanisms. We use the observationally guided three-dimensional kinematic \bl\ dynamo model, which has emerged as a successful model for reproducing many characteristic features of the solar cycle. We use Morlet wavelet and global wavelet power spectrum techniques to analyze the data obtained from the model. In our model, we report QBOs and Rieger-type periods for the first time. Further, we investigate the individual \bl\ parameters (fluctuations in flux, latitude, time delay and tilt scatter) role in the occurrence of QBOs and Rieger-type periods. We find that while fluctuations in the individual parameters of the \bl\ process can produce QBOs and Rieger-type periodicity, their occurrence probability is enhanced when we consider combined fluctuations of all parameters in the \bl\ process. Finally, we find that with the increase of dynamo supercriticality, the model tends to suppress the generation of Rieger-type periodicity. Thus, this result supports earlier studies that suggest the solar dynamo is not highly supercritical.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood. LV. M Dwarf Twin Binaries -- One in Five Twin Sibling Pairs Are Mismatched in Activity and/or Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a study of 36 pairs of `twin' M dwarfs in wide binaries and assess how similarly the stars behave. Stars in each twin pair have BP, RP, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ differing by $&lt;$0.10 mag, mass estimates matching within $&lt;$3%, and presumably the same age and composition. We utilize short-- and long-term photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and archival data to measure rotation periods, photometric activity levels, and H$\alpha$ equivalent widths for many systems. Speckle imaging, radial velocities, and long-term astrometry are used to identify unresolved companions, yielding three systems with unseen components. Among the 33 remaining twin systems, numerous remarkable pairs show nearly identical rotation rates and activity levels between their twin components, including cases throughout the lower main sequence and across a broad range of rotation-activity parameter space. In contrast, mismatches with $&gt;$25% differences exist in rotation period for $21\%_{-7\%}^{+14\%}$ of twin pairs, in rotation amplitude for $67\%_{-15\%}^{+10\%}$ of pairs, in multi-year photometric variability for $33\%_{-9\%}^{+12\%}$ of pairs, and in H$\alpha$ activity for $21\%_{-6\%}^{+9\%}$ of pairs, with fully convective systems generally mismatched more often. Thus, roughly one out of five M dwarf twin sets does not match in rotation and/or activity despite otherwise identical fundamental parameters. Furthermore, we compile three key systems showing larger relative active/inactive H$\alpha$ mismatches. We propose the various mismatches likely stem from factors such as dynamo stochasticity, activity cycles, formative disk aspects, and/or star-planet interactions, depending on the system. These well-vetted twins offer ripe targets for many future investigations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of multi-temperature coronal mass ejection signatures from a young solar analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the early Sun may have profoundly influenced the planetary atmospheres of early Solar System planets. Flaring young solar analogues serve as excellent proxies for probing the plasma environment of the young Sun, yet their CMEs remain poorly understood. Here we report the detection of multi-wavelength Doppler shifts in Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) and optical lines during a flare on the young solar analog EK Draconis. During and before a Carrington-class ($\sim$10$^{32}$ erg) flare, warm FUV lines ($\sim$10$^5$ K) exhibit blueshifted emission at 300-550 km s$^{-1}$, indicative of a warm eruption. 10 minutes later, the H$\alpha$ line shows slow (70 km s$^{-1}$), long-lasting ($\gtrsim$2 hrs) blueshifted absorptions, suggesting a cool ($\sim$10$^4$ K) filament eruption. This provides evidence of multi-temperature and multi-component nature of a stellar CME. If Carrington-class flares/CMEs occurred frequently on the young Sun, they may have cumulatively impacted the early Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Do Young Suns Produce Frequent, Massive CMEs? Results from Five-year Dedicated Optical Observations of EK Draconis and V889 Hercules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from a five-year (132-night) dedicated observational campaign targeting two nearby young solar-type stars, EK Draconis ($\sim$50-125 Myr age) and V889 Hercules ($\sim$30 Myr age), using the 3.8m Seimei Telescope and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The aim is to observationally constrain statistical properties of flaring radiation/heating as well as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), through high time-cadence H$\alpha$ spectroscopy. We obtained an unprecedented sample of 15 H$\alpha$ superflares, including two blueshifted absorption, two blueshifted emission, one redshifted emission, and nine line broadening events. We obtain the following results: (1) Larger flares exhibit broader H$\alpha$ line widths, up to 14.1$_{\pm 2.4}$ {\AA}, indicating higher chromospheric heating than solar flares. (2) The long-lasting redshifted event at $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$ may indicate dense post-flare loops. (3) H$\alpha$ blueshifted absorptions/emissions provide evidence of massive filament/prominence eruptions, the core structures of CMEs. One newly identified event showed an unexpected rapid decrease in velocity. (4) The lower limit of the CME/eruption association rate with superflares is 27$_{-16}^{+25}$%, yielding occurrence rates of 0.21$_{\pm0.12}$ and $&lt;$0.32$^{+0.46}_{-0.32}$ events per day for EK Draconis and V889 Hercules, respectively. (5) We derived the first direct estimate of the lower limit of the mass-loss rate driven by super-CMEs ($\gtrsim10^{33}$ erg) for EK Dra as $4 \times (10^{-13}$-$10^{-12})$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the stellar wind mass loss at a similar age. This study provides critical observational constraints on the radiation and plasma environment around young solar-type stars and the early Sun, which can drive planetary space weather and stellar mass/angular momentum loss.</description>

      <title>Coronal Mass Ejections from Young Suns: Insights from Solar and Stellar Observations and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries have revealed exoplanets orbiting young Sun-like stars, offering a window into the early solar system. These young stars frequently produce extreme magnetic explosions known as superflares, roughly once a day, potentially leading to fast and massive coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent research have highlighted the importance of stellar CMEs, as these events and associated particles can trigger atmospheric loss and initiate chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres. However, the observation of these associated CMEs remains largely unexplored, marking a crucial first step in assessing the particle environment. Here we present the results of 5-years multi-wavelength observations of young Sun-like stars, providing the critical clues to the common picture of solar and stellar CMEs. First, through optical spectroscopic observations, we found four of fifteen superflares are associated with fast prominence eruptions, precursors to CMEs. The stellar data greatly resemble solar counterparts, indicating a common picture of solar/stellar eruptions. Second, one of the eruptions is associated with potential coronal dimming in X-rays, indicating that the prominence eruptions evolved into stellar CMEs propagating through interplanetary space. Furthermore, the extension of solar MHD model supports the above indication and suggests that the eruption originates from the active region inferred by Zeeman Doppler Imaging and TESS light curve modeling. This comprehensive study suggests that further advancing the use of solar model could provide the first empirical inputs into calculations of atmospheric escape/chemical reactions for young planets.</description>

      <title>The oscillation properties of the Blue Large Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs): relative change rate of periods, excitations, and period relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{B}lue \textbf{L}arge \textbf{A}mplitude \textbf{P}ulsators (BLAPs) are a type of variable star that has been identified relatively recently. They are characterized by their large amplitude, high gravity, and long periods (2-75 minutes). Some BLAPs exhibit a rich helium abundance on their surfaces, while some of the others show rich hydrogen atmospheres. Up to date, both the mode identification and formation pathways of BLAPs remain subjects of ongoing debate. In this work, we gave an non-adiabatic pulsation analyses for low-order radial and non-radial dipole modes on a theoretical model grid to explore the characterist ics of BLAPs. The effects of element diffusion and radiative levitation are not taken into account our theoretical models. This because that these processes could lead to discrepancies in surface element abundance of the sdB or BLAP stars between theoretical models and observations. Based on the theoretical model grid, our analyses revealed that the radial fundamental modes align well with various observed properties of BLAPs, including the pulsation instability, the position of the excitable models on the HR diagram, surface element compositions, period ranges, and period changes. Our theoretical models also predicted a period-gravity ($\log g$) relation with a narrow distribution, while the observations exhibit a broader range. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the excitation of pulsation in BLAPs is primarily influenced by metal abundance. The thickness of the outer rich hydrogen envelope and the ratio of helium to hydrogen on the surface almost do not affect the pulsation instability.</description>

      <title>Photometric and Spectroscopic Studies of Four Low Mass-ratio Contact Binaries with Period Longer than 0.7 days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric and spectroscopic studies of four long-period low mass-ratio contact binaries, V0508 And, V0844 Aur, V0699 Cep, and NSVS 6259046, are performed. V0508 And, V0844 Aur, and V0699 Cep are found to be A-type low-mass-ratio medium-contact binaries, while NSVS 6259046 is found to be an A-type deep-contact binary. O - C analysis indicates no long-term variation in V0844 Aur. However, the orbital periods of the other three targets are increasing. We conclude that V0844 Aur, V0699 Cep and NSVS 6259046 are magnetically active, as evidenced by the presence and variable nature of the O'Connell effect in these systems. By analyzing the LAMOST spectroscopic data, we find out that NSVS 6259046 and V0508 And exhibit no chromospheric activity on the dates the LAMOST spectra were taken, while the low signal-to-noise ratio in LAMOST data for V0844 Aur prevents us from obtaining reliable results. We discover that V0699 Cep is an early-type contact binary with chromospheric activity. Their initial masses and ages are calculated. All four systems are determined to be currently stable. We collect 217 contact binaries with both spectroscopic and photometric observations, and compare the differences between short-period and long-period systems in terms of mass-luminosity relation and mass-radius relation, using 0.7 days as the period boundary.</description>

      <title>Instability and vertical eccentricity variation in global hydrodynamic disk simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dynamical interactions can induce eccentricities in astrophysical accretion disks. Disk eccentricities in turn seed a variety of instabilities, even in ideal hydrodynamics. We use 3D nonlinear simulations and 2+1D linear calculations to characterize local and global instabilities in strongly distorted disks. On local scales, our simulations show the growth of parametrically excited inertial waves, which drive wave turbulence. The inertial waves' growth rates and localizations agree with the predictions of local theory. On global scales, we observe the growth of a separate family of low-frequency, vertically structured modes that compare favorably with eigenmodes computed from the linear theory of an eccentric background state. These low-frequency modes interact nonlinearly with the inertial wave turbulence driven by parametric instability, and they induce variation in eccentricity profiles that are initially uniform in the vertical direction. Extrapolating from our vertically local framework, we postulate that these secondary distortions may correspond to the corrugation of an initially planar eccentric disk. Our simulations demonstrate that strong disk eccentricities drive numerous dynamical phenomena even in a purely hydrodynamic, Newtonian framework.</description>

      <title>Magnesium Isotopic Detection in Cool Stars: Tracing Nucleosynthetic Signatures from MgH Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) isotopic ratios offer valuable insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution, particularly in distinguishing contributions from supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. These isotopes are accessible via MgH molecular features in cool stellar atmospheres, though their measurement remains challenging across spectral types. We assess the reliability of MgH spectral regions for extracting magnesium isotopic ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) in stars from M to G types and evaluate consistency with nucleosynthetic expectations. Using spectrum synthesis, we applied an analysis pipeline, validated by three well-studied reference stars, to a sample of five additional dwarf and giant stars. Individual MgH band regions were analysed for sensitivity to isotopic variation. Europium (Eu) and barium (Ba) abundances were also measured to explore correlations with Mg isotopic ratios as r- and s-process proxies. Of ten previously studied MgH wavelength regions, we identify seven as most reliable for isotopic analysis; others showed limited sensitivity across stellar types. Derived Mg isotope ratios ($^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg, $^{26}$Mg) include: HD 11695-81:7:12; HD 18884-81:7:12; HD 18907-69:9:23; HD 22049-71:16:13; HD 23249-66:13:22; HD 128621-67:17:16; HD 10700-78:10:12; HD 100407-65:10:25. Comparison of Eu abundances with Mg isotopes reveals strong correlations, particularly with ($^{24}$Mg, which is predominantly produced by hydrostatic $\alpha$-capture in massive stars, a process preceding the r-process responsible for Eu. In contrast, Ba shows no significant correlation with $^{25}$Mg or $^{26}$Mg, despite their shared s-process origin. Our results demonstrate that selected MgH regions can reliably measure Mg isotopes in cool stars, providing a reproducible framework for future studies of stellar nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding solar flares is critical for predicting space weather, as their activity shapes how the Sun influences Earth and its environment. The development of reliable forecasting methodologies of these events depends on robust flare catalogs, but current methods are limited to flare classification using integrated soft X-ray emission that are available only from Earth's perspective. This reduces accuracy in pinpointing the location and strength of farside flares and their connection to geoeffective events. In this work, we introduce a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach that translates Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations into soft x-ray flux while also setting the groundwork for estimating flare locations in the future. The model achieves accurate flux predictions across flare classes using quantitative metrics. This paves the way for EUV-based flare detection to be extended beyond Earth's line of sight, which allows for a more comprehensive and complete solar flare catalog.</description>

      <title>The Missing Mechanism: Picoflare Heating in the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronal heating problem has been explored through wave heating and impulsive nanoflare paradigms. Solar Orbiter observations reveal picoflares (10^20-10^24 erg) extending below the Parker-Aschwanden minimal coronal nanoflare limit. These events involve two distinct mechanisms: short-duration looptop tearing-mode reconnection and long-duration footpoint anomalous resistivity. This dual-mechanism framework resolves the long-standing energy partition paradox and bridges photospheric energy injection with coronal thermalization.</description>

      <title>Morphological and Kinematical Diagnostic of FU Orionis-type Outburst Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the possibility of determining the mechanism of the FU Orionis-type outburst based on molecular line observations of protoplanetary disks with synthetic observations of distinct numerical burst models. The morphology of the synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission is sensitive to gas temperature and does not coincide with the actual gas disk structures, particularly in the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and clump-infall models, which exhibit peculiar temperature distributions. This highlights the need for careful interpretation of morphologies of line emission from disks under accretion outbursts. The synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission of each model exhibits distinct kinematic features that can be used to distinguish outburst scenarios. In the MRI model, kinematic features of the gravitational instability (GI), which fuels MRI-driven accretion bursts, are small in both amplitude and spatial extent, resulting in no prominent local features in the residual velocity map at a typical distance for FU Orionis-type objects. In contrast, the clump-infall model shows a clear sign of gas expansion along a spiral, which is caused by exchange of angular momentum between an infalling clump and surrounding gas. The intruder model exhibits a highly asymmetric velocity structure with respect to the systemic velocity of the primary protostar in velocity channel maps. These distinct kinematic features may serve as promising diagnostics for distinguishing the physical mechanisms responsible for FU Orionis-type outbursts.</description>

      <title>Coronal Mass Ejections Deflected by Newly Emerging Flux: A Combined Analytic and Numerical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newly emerging flux (NEF) has been widely studied as a trigger of solar filament eruptions, but its influence on the subsequent dynamics remains poorly explored. Because NEF typically emerges adjacent to filaments, it imposes magnetic asymmetry that can drive non-radial eruptions and complicate space-weather forecasting. We bridge analytic catastrophe theory with 2D resistive MHD simulations: analytic solutions provide magnetic configurations containing a flux rope at the loss-of-equilibrium point, which are then used as initial conditions for simulations to examine the following dynamics. We find that NEF governs the kinematics of filament eruptions in two ways. First, by reshaping coronal stability, NEF can create or eliminate a higher equilibrium in corona, thereby producing failed eruptions or CMEs. In the transitional situation where a metastable equilibrium appears, the rising filament decelerates and stalls before re-accelerating into a CME, consistent with observed two-step eruptions. Second, by breaking symmetry, NEF deflects eruptions away from the radial direction: depending on its polarity, it acts as a repulsor or an attractor on eruptive filaments, and the deflection magnitude increases with the degree of asymmetry. Our theory yields two characteristic angles that predict the deflection directions of CMEs and failed eruptions, and simulations closely aligns with these predictors. These results highlight the NEF not only as a trigger but also as a key factor that governs both the acceleration and deflection of eruptions during their propagation in the low corona.</description>

      <title>SN2017ckj: A linearly declining Type IIb supernova with a relatively massive hydrogen envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion. Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute peak magnitude of $M_{\rm V}=-18.58\pm0.17\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\ M_\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\ M_\odot$. Both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\rm H_\alpha$ and \Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\sim 3.4\times10^{-4}M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\rm H_\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\rm H_\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \Oi, \Caii, [\Caii], and \Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Study of delta-Sunspots from Solar Cycle 23 to 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots or active regions (ARs) with a delta-magnetic configuration are known to be associated with strong eruptions such as flares and mass ejections. This article investigates the relationship between delta-ARs and flares over the course of three solar cycles (SCs), from 1996 to 2024, with respect to the former's area, lifetime, latitudinal distribution, and phase of its magnetic complexity. Solar cycle 25 has produced the least number of delta-ARs in comparison to the previous two solar cycles, yet the number of M- and X-class flares exceed that of cycle 24 by 25%. Flare occurrence is higher in C-, M-, and X-class events during the presence of the delta-configuration which is seen in all 3 SCs. The total number of flares produced by delta- and non-delta-ARs were 15875 and 17033, respectively across all 3 SCs. The latter are dominated by B- and C-class flares, while the number of M- and X-class flares across all 3 SCs was significantly less than compared to delta-ARs. The median lifetime of an AR in the delta- and non-delta phase is about 5 and 8 days, respectively. The typical number of flares produced by a delta-AR is 20, with maximum values ranging from 80-156 for lifetimes between 6-13 days. However, about 30% of delta-ARs do not produce flares when their lifetimes are between 6-12 days. The latitudinal distribution of delta-ARs across the northern and southern hemispheres is nearly symmetric on either side of the equator for SCs 23 and 24, peaking around +/-10 deg-20 deg. For solar cycles 23 and 24, about 30% of the host delta-ARs have an area exceeding the mean value over the above latitudinal belt while for SC 25, there is a large scatter possibly due to the cycle still being in progress. It remains to be seen if the latter phase of SC 25 will be as active as its earlier phase and whether the number of delta-ARs emerging during that period scale with the total sunspot number.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the chromospheric structure model of AD Leo using RH1.5D and magnetic field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The interplay between surface magnetic topology and chromospheric heating in active M dwarfs remains poorly constrained, limiting our understanding of their magnetic cycles and high-energy environments. Aims. We aim to test whether detailed Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) maps of AD Leo can be used to spatially anchor a multi-component chromospheric model and validate the link between magnetic flux distribution and emission-line formation. Methods. We analyze high-resolution CARMENES spectra of H-alpha and the Ca II infrared triplet, together with ZDI maps. Synthetic profiles are computed using the RH1.5D non-LTE radiative transfer code with two active atmospheric components (low-latitude near the equator and polar near the pole) and a quiet background. Their relative filling factors and temperature structures are optimized per epoch. The ZDI maps serve as qualitative references for the large-scale magnetic topology but are not used as input to the optimization. Results. Our model reproduces the spectral line profiles across multiple epochs. The low-latitude active region shows notable variability, accounting for approximately 55-86% of the emission, while the polar region remains relatively constant in area (12-17%) but exhibits temperature variations over time, particularly during periods of increased activity. The spatial locations of the active regions derived from spectroscopy agree well with the radial magnetic field distribution from ZDI. Conclusions. Combining spectroscopic modeling with magnetic field maps is an effective approach for mapping magneto-chromospheric structures in M dwarfs. This framework deepens our understanding of stellar magnetic cycles and chromospheric dynamics, paving the way for detailed time-resolved studies in active low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>The Sun as an X-ray star V.: A new method to retrieve coronal filling factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Stellar coronae are unresolved in X-rays, so inferences about their structure rely on spectral analysis. The "Sun-as-an-X-ray-star" (SaXS) approach uses the Sun as a spatially resolved template to interpret stellar spectra, but previous SaXS implementations were indirect and computationally heavy. Aims. We present a new SaXS implementation that converts solar emission measure distributions (EMDs) of distinct coronal region types into XSPEC spectral components and test whether broad-band X-ray spectra alone can recover their filling factors. Methods. We built XSPEC multi-temperature spectral models for four solar region types (background/quiet corona, active regions, cores, and flares) by using EMDs derived from Yohkoh/SXT data and translating each EMD bin into an isothermal apec component. These models were fit (using PyXspec) to two one-hour DAXSS spectra representative of quiescent (2022-06-29) and flaring (2022-04-25) states. Best-fit normalizations were converted into projected areas and filling factors and compared with near-coincident Hinode/XRT full-disk images. Results. Using the Yohkoh/SXT EMDs, the quiescent Sun spectrum is dominated by active region emission (filling factor ~22%), with the background corona poorly constrained. The flaring Sun spectrum is best described by a combination of active regions, cores, and flares with filling factors of ~47.5%, ~4.1%, and ~0.062%, respectively. The dominant components match spatial features seen in Hinode/XRT images. Limitations include the DAXSS low-energy cutoff (~0.7 keV) and the small, non-uniform Yohkoh EMD sample. Conclusions. Our SaXS implementation enables direct retrieval of coronal filling factors from broad-band X-ray spectra and provides a physically motivated alternative to ad hoc few-temperature fits, suitable for stellar X-ray analyses.</description>

      <title>Spinning-down RU Lup. Constraints on the physics of the outflow from high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic winds are a key mechanism for angular momentum removal in young stars. In this work, we aim at characterizing the multi-component outflow of RU Lup. The unprecedented high resolution of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) enabled a detailed study of the forbidden emission lines and the blueshifted absorption in the lines of the Na I and Ca II doublets, which we resolved in three discrete absorption components at low, medium, and high velocities. We developed a method that disentangles vertical and toroidal velocities in the absorption components and infers the wind launching radius, magnetic lever arm, and mass-loss rate. We identified a low-velocity broad component in the [O I] 5577 line, consistent with a rotating magnetohydrodynamic disk wind launched near the disk truncation radius. We showed that the discrete absorption components trace spatially and physically distinct regions of the outflow. The medium and low velocity components are launched from the inner disk (&lt; 6.76 stellar radii) with low lever arms indicative of warm, highly mass-loaded streamlines. However, the two components differ mainly in vertical velocity. The low velocity absorption is consistent with an outer absorbing shell, while the medium velocity absorption forms near the disk truncation radius. Its higher vertical velocity is compatible with either a slightly larger lever arm, or additional heating at the base of the flow. For plausible ionization levels in the inner disk, this outflow component removes a substantial fraction of the accretion spin-up torque. In conclusion, our work shows that RU Lup hosts a stratified, rotating, warm disk wind launched across a narrow annulus near the disk truncation radius, which is sufficiently mass-loaded to extract a large amount of the stellar spin-up torque. The observations disfavor an X-wind scenario.</description>

      <title>Fundamental effective temperature measurements for eclipsing binary stars - VI. Improved methodology and application to the circumbinary planet host star BEBOP-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BEBOP-3 is detached eclipsing binary star that shows total eclipses of a faint M~dwarf every 13.2 days by a 9$^{\rm th}$-magnitude F9V star. High precision radial velocity measurements have recently shown that this binary star is orbited by a planet with an orbital period $\approx 550$ days. The extensive spectroscopy used to detect this circumbinary planet has also been used to directly measure the masses of the stars in the eclipsing binary. We have used light curves from the TESS mission combined with these mass measurements to directly measure the following radii and surface gravities for the stars in this system: $R_1 = 1.386 \pm 0.010\,R_{\odot}$, $\log g_1 = 4.190 \pm 0.004$, $R_2 = 0.274 \pm 0.002\,R_{\odot}$, $\log g_2 = 4.979 \pm 0.002$. We describe an improved version of our method to measure the effective temperatures (T$_{\rm eff}$) of stars in binary systems directly from their angular diameters and bolometric fluxes. We measure T$_{\rm eff,1} = 6065{\rm\,K} \pm 44\,{\rm K}$ and T$_{\rm eff,2} = 3191{\rm\,K} \pm 40\,{\rm K}$ for the stars in BEBOP-3 using this method. BEBOP-3 can be added to our growing sample of stars that can be used test the accuracy of spectroscopic and photometric methods to estimate T$_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ for solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Fine details in solar flare ribbons: Statistical insights from observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flare ribbons serve as chromospheric footprints of energy deposition resulting from particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection. Their fine-scale structure provides a valuable tool for probing the dynamics of the flare reconnection process. Our goal is to investigate the fine-scale structure of flare ribbons through multiple observations of flares, utilising data obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). The aligned AIA and SST datasets for the three solar flares were used to examine their overall morphology. The SST datasets were specifically used to identify fine-scale structures within the flare ribbons. For spectroscopic analysis of these fine structures, we applied machine-learning methods (k-means clustering) and Gaussian fitting. Using k-means, we identified elongated features in the flare ribbons, termed as "riblets", which are short-lived and jet-like small-scale structures that extend as plasma columns from the flare ribbons. Riblets are more prominent near the solar limb and represent the ribbon front. Riblet widths are consistent across observations, ranging from 110-310 km (0".15-0".41), while vertical lengths span 620-1220 km (0".83-1".66), with a potential maximum of 2000 km (2".67), after accounting for projection effects. Detailed H-beta spectral analysis reveals that riblets exhibit a single, redshifted emission component, with velocities of 16-21 km s^1, independent of viewing angle. Our high-resolution observations of the three flare ribbons show that they are not continuous structures, but are composed of vertically extended, fine-scale substructures. These irregular features indicate that the reconnection region is not a smooth, laminar current sheet, but rather a fragmented zone filled with magnetic islands, consistent with the theory of patchy reconnection within the coronal current sheet.</description>

      <title>Energetics of star-planet magnetic interactions: Novel insights from 3D modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMI) occurring in the sub-Alfvenic regime can, in principle, induce stellar chromospheric hotspots. Currently, estimates of the power generated by SPMI primarily rely on analytical scaling laws that relate stellar and planetary parameters to the interaction energetics. The existing scaling laws published in the literature so far do not agree with each other by at least an order of magnitude. Our aim is to quantify an absolute upper limit on the power that a planet can channel back to its host star during such interactions, which in turn lead to the formation of stellar hotspots. By performing a series of 3D MHD simulations with varied parameters known to influence the energetics of SPMI, we derive a numerically supported scaling law that can be used to reliably estimate the energy channeled from the planet back to the star. Our results suggest that existing analytical scaling laws may not fully capture the power transferred from the planet to the star through SPMI. The scaling law derived from our numerical simulations appears to provide a more comprehensive estimate, reflecting dependencies on common stellar and planetary parameters also considered in earlier models. Moreover, our findings indicate that power generation involves not only the planetary obstacle itself but also the extended magnetic structure of the Alfven wings interacting with the streaming stellar wind. This study suggests that care should be taken when applying analogies directly from jovian sub-Alfvenic interactions to SPMI, as the underlying physical conditions (specifically the value of the Alfvenic Mach number) may not be directly comparable. Our numerically derived scaling law offers a potentially improved approach for estimating SPMI power, capturing some of the interaction's complexities exclusive to SPMI.</description>

      <title>The AMBRE Project: Line-broadening and stellar rotation of ESO/FEROS archived spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter in stellar studies. However, large homogeneous catalogues of rotational velocities derived from high-resolution stellar spectra are still lacking. The main objective of this work is to determine the line-broadening parameter (Vbroad), a proxy for the stellar rotational velocity, in a large sample of FGKM stars based on their ESO/FEROS spectra, previously parameterised by the AMBRE Project. Vbroad was estimated by cross-correlating the FEROS spectra with AMBRE binary masks. This methodology also relies on a specific calibration of a coupling constant between the rotational velocity and the width of the cross-correlation function. This fundamental step was performed by adopting the AMBRE grid of synthetic spectra. The derived Vbroad were then validated using data from the literature, ground-based spectroscopic surveys, and Gaia/RVS. After analysing more than 5,000 FEROS spectra (including repeated spectra for several stars), we obtained the line-broadening coefficients for 2,584 stars covering the FGKM spectral types, any stellar gravity, and metallicities between the metal-poor up to sub-solar regimes. The mean Vbroad relative uncertainty of this sample was found to be smaller than 8%. As expected, most stars were found to be slow rotators (below a few km/s), in particular, cool dwarfs and giants. However, several hot dwarfs and high-luminosity stars with high-Vbroad rates were identified, most of them not previously classified as fast rotators and/or affected by large macro-turbulent effects. The measured rotational broadening values are of high-quality and verified on the basis of literature comparisons. We publicly provide this catalogue of Vbroad parameters, including stellar atmospheric and quality parameters, for the analysed AMBRE/FEROS sources.</description>

      <title>The Near-Ultraviolet Spectra of FU Orionis Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the first high-sensitivity NUV (1800 to 3200 \AA) survey of FU Ori objects, using the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) STIS spectrograph. We compare new low resolution spectra for 6 sources with predictions from accretion disk models and find that all show emission in excess of the disk model spectrum. The physical properties of the NUV emission excess are very consistent among the sample, with a mean luminosity of $10^{-1.11 \pm 0.4} \ L_\odot$ and temperature of $16400 \pm 2600$ K -- despite spanning 0.9 dex in $M_*$, 1.3 dex in $\dot{M}$, and 0.7 dex in $L_\mathrm{acc}$. We use the spectra to conclusively rule out the existence of a hot boundary layer in FU Ori accretion disks. We then discuss the source of the excess emission in the context of recent simulations of FU Ori outbursts and boundary layer accretion. The UV spectra also show the often-seen \ion{C}{2}] 2326 \AA\ multiplet and \ion{Mg}{2} 2796/2803 \AA\ doublet, as well as the unusual \ion{Fe}{2}] 2507/2509 \AA\ doublet, a feature that is not seen in the existing UV spectra of other young stellar objects. We measure and compare the luminosities of these lines in outbursting with those in non-outbursting objects.</description>

      <title>Unveiling stellar (and planetary) internal dynamics with the fully compressible MUSIC code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations have transformed the study of stellar interiors over the past few decades. Most codes developed during that time use the anelastic approximation, which fixes the thermal structure of simulations and filters out sound waves. Many of them also use explicit time integration, which imposes severe constraints on the time step of the simulations. In this context, MUSIC is developed to overcome these limitations. Its main scientific objective is to improve the phenomenological approaches used in 1D stellar evolution codes to describe major hydrodynamical and MHD processes. Here, we review recent applications of the MUSIC code, that focus mainly on convection, convective boundary mixing and waves in stars that possess convective cores, shells and/or envelopes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point Matching: Evaluating Multiscale Dubuc Distance for Time Series Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance (MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations, in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses. Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Metallicity regulates planet formation across all masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of stellar metallicity in shaping planetary systems is central to our understanding of planet formation. While the core accretion paradigm is widely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and intermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains debated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their existence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on metallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy for the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar photospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in metal-rich environments. Z correlates not only with the presence of planets, but also with planetary system multiplicity and total planetary mass. The most massive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in agreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass distribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity. These findings suggest that the chemical enrichment of protoplanetary disks plays a central role in shaping the full spectrum of planetary masses.</description>

      <title>Definition of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter reviews the definition of exoplanets and of brown dwarfs. Emphasis is given to the separation of these two populations. A traditional view is to declare {\guillemotleft} planet {\guillemotright} objects with a mass &lt; 13 M Jup and {\guillemotleft} brown dwarf {\guillemotright} objects with a mass &gt; 13 M Jup . By analogy with Solar System planets, a better definition is to call {\guillemotleft} planets {\guillemotright} objects formed by accretion of dust and planetesimals in a disk. An by extension of the primitive introduction of the word {\guillemotleft} brown dwarf {\guillemotright} for failed stars by Jill Tarter, this term must be reserved to objects formed by gravitational collapse in a molecular gas cloud. The two definitions do not coincide since a {\guillemotleft} brown dwarf {\guillemotright} can have a mass down to about 6 Jupiter mass. And there is no physical reason to assert that a 20 Jupiter mass object has not been formed by accretion. From there, the difficulty is to decide if an object of say 20 Jupiter mass is formed by dust accretion or by gravitational collapse. A future observational test to solve this difficulty is presented.</description>

      <title>A new group of low-spin $50-70M_\odot$ Black Holes and the high pair-instability mass cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISN) will not leave compact remnants and hence yield a mass gap of the black holes. Though a transition point of $\sim 45M_\odot$ between low-spin and high-spin black holes groups had been inferred with gravitational wave data since 2022 and then interpreted as the signature of the PISN mass gap, here we report the emergence of a new group of low-spin but massive ($\sim 50-70M_\odot$) black holes, which are hard to produce via hierarchical mergers, in the latest GWTC-4.0 data. Correspondingly, the mass cutoff of the low-spin black holes shifts to $68.5^{+19.8}_{-18.5}M_\odot$ ($90\%$ credibility), which is consistent with the PISN model for a low $^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction rate of $S_{300{\rm keV}} \sim 110~{\rm keV~b}$. Despite that the massive single-star collapse/dynamical capture origin can not be reliably tested at this moment, a high pair-instability mass cutoff $M_{\rm low}\sim 70M_\odot$ may be favored for its capability of accounting for the rather low observation rate of hydrogen-less super-luminous supernovae.</description>

      <title>The MDW H{\alpha} Sky Survey: Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) H$\alpha$ Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated all-sky narrow-band (3nm) H$\alpha$ imaging survey. The survey was founded by amateur astronomers and the northern sky (Decl. $\geq$ 0$^\circ$) is presented here in its second stage of refinement for academic use. Each 3.6$\times$3.6 sq. deg MDW field has 12 20-minute individual exposures with a pixel scale of 3.6", a typical PSF of 6", and a stack point source depth of 16-17 magnitudes. The northern MDW Survey Data Release 1 (DR1) includes: calibrated and raw mean and individual images, star-removed mean fields, and point source catalogs for all images matched to Data Release 1 of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS). Our initial study of H$\alpha$ filament widths finds a typical FWHM of 30-45" in the Lyra region. The matched catalogs (with a median match distance of ~0.5"), combined with our distinctive narrow-band photometry, are used to identify H$\alpha$ variable and excess sources. These initial studies highlight some of the many scientific uses of the MDW H$\alpha$ survey.</description>

      <title>SN 2024iss: A Double-peaked Type IIb Supernova with Evidence of Circumstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray observations of supernova (SN) 2024iss, a Type IIb SN that shows a prominent double-peaked light curve. We modeled the first peak with a semianalytical shock-cooling model and the X-ray emission with a free-free model. We compare the envelope radius and mass-loss rate with other Type IIb SNe to explore the relationships between the progenitor envelope and the circumstellar material (CSM). The shock-cooling peak in the $V$-band light curve reached $M_V = -17.33\pm 0.26$mag, while the $^{56}$Ni-powered second peak attained $M_V = -17.43\pm 0.26$mag. Early spectra show an photospheric velocity of $\sim19,400\,km\,s^{-1}$ at 3.82days from the H$\alpha$ P~Cygni profile. The Balmer lines persist at least +87 days after the explosion, characterizing hydrogen-rich ejecta. Modeling the first light-curve peak suggests an extended envelope with a mass of $0.11\pm0.04\,M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $244\pm43~R_{\odot}$. Fitting the second light-curve peak with an Arnett-like model indicates a typical $^{56}$Ni mass of $ 0.117\pm0.013~M_{\odot}$ and a relatively low ejecta mass of $1.272\pm0.343\,M_{\odot}$. X-ray observations reveal bright thermal bremsstrahlung emission and indicate a mass-loss rate of $1.6\times10^{-5}\ M_{\odot} \ \rm{yr}^{-1}$. SN 2024iss occupies a transitional position between the two subclasses of extended (eIIb) and compact (cIIb) Type IIb SNe. Its envelope radius and pre-explosion mass-loss rate appear to be correlated as theoretically predicted. The observational properties of SN 2024iss are compatible with a binary interaction scenario being the dominant mechanism for envelope stripping. Furthermore, the low column density of neutral hydrogen suggests a compact CSM with an outer radius of $\lesssim1.3\times10^{14}$ cm, indicating that the progenitor star experienced eruptive mass loss within $\sim4\,yr$ of its terminal explosion.</description>

      <title>Using Type-II Cepheids as Extragalactic Standard Candles: Distances to M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several standard candles have been tested and used to measure accurate extragalactic distances over the past decades. There have been discussions regarding the possibility of using Type-II Cepheids (T2Cs) as an alternative tool, but rarely was this ever implemented. The aim of this project is to assert the use of T2Cs as a new avenue for calibrating the extragalactic distance scale, by using M31 as a benchmark galaxy. Since Ordinary Least Squares regression methods are not immune to outliers and offer an incomplete treatment of the uncertainties, we favor a Bayesian robust regression model to compute new Period--Luminosity (PL) and Period--Wesenheit (PW) relations calibrated using $\sim$100 T2Cs, $\sim$1000 fundamental-mode and $\sim$750 first-overtone classical Cepheids (CCs) in the LMC. Using these relations, we employ a classification routine based on Bhattacharyya distances to filter out any contaminants from the M31 sample. We validate our method by verifying that we retrieve an accurate distance for the LMC. We find a distance to M31 of $24.487\pm0.001$ (statistical) $\pm0.052$ (systematic) mag using CCs and of $24.409\pm0.025$ (statistical) $\pm0.156$ (systematic) mag using T2Cs. Both values are in excellent agreement with literature values derived from meta-analyses, from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of CCs, from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch method, and from HST observations of RR Lyrae. In almost all cases, we reach a relative accuracy better than 98\%, although the archival ground-based data we use cannot compare with HST photometry. We demonstrate that T2Cs can also be used as accurate tracers for determining extragalactic distances, thereby making them excellent candidates for JWST, LSST, and ELT observations. These stars allow us to probe galaxies deprived of young populations and are beyond the reach of the fainter RR Lyrae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fourth part of the Alma Luminous Star catalogue (ALS IV) aims to create the most comprehensive sample of massive stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). By combining Gaia DR3 with Simbad and complementing this information with other photometric and spectroscopic catalogues, we select the massive stars in this region. To achieve this, we apply filters in photometry, combining different bands, as well as in variability and spectral types from the literature. With this approach, we will obtain one of the most complete samples of massive stars in the MCs, which can be used both to study the Clouds and the Magellanic Bridge, as well as the massive stars they contain.</description>

      <title>The MiMO Catalog: Physical Parameters and Stellar Mass Functions of 1,232 Open Clusters from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous catalog of 1,232 open clusters with precisely determined ages, metallicities, distances, extinctions, and stellar mass function (MF) slopes, derived from Gaia DR3 data. The parameters are inferred using the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework for modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting for field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the conventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more complete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and robustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved precision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity, distance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and photometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify an ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the MF estimates are considered most reliable. The catalog and an open-source implementation of MiMO are made publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Solar flare forecasting with foundational transformer models across image, video, and time-series modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of transformer-based architectures for solar flare forecasting using heterogeneous data modalities, including images, video sequences, and time-series observations. Our analysis evaluates three recent foundational models - SigLIP2 for image encoding, VideoMAE for spatio-temporal video representation, and Moirai2 for multivariate time-series forecasting - applied to publicly available datasets of solar magnetograms from the SDO/HMI mission and soft X-ray fluxes acquired by GOES satellites. All models are trained and validated under consistent data splits and evaluation criteria, with the goal of assessing the strengths and limitations of transformer backbones across spatial and temporal representations of solar activity. We investigate multiple loss formulations (weighted BCE, focal, and score-oriented) and training balance strategies to mitigate class imbalance typical of flare datasets. Results show that while both SigLIP2 and VideoMAE achieve typical performance on image and video data (True Skill Statistic TSS~0.60-0.65), the time-series model Moirai2 reaches superior forecasting skill (TSS~0.74) using irradiance-based temporal evolution alone. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained transformer architectures and cross-modal learning for advancing operational space weather forecasting, paving the way toward unified multimodal models that integrate visual and temporal information.</description>

Abstract: Bow shocks around massive stars have primarily been detected in IR emission, but radio detections are becoming more frequent with the commissioning of sensitive and large field-of-view interferometers. Radio data probes both thermal and non-thermal emission, thereby constraining the relativistic electron population. We undertook a radio survey for bow shocks based on IR catalogues of candidates, using the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg Telescope, aiming for new detections and to better characterise the multi-wavelength emission. We used Gaia DR3 to re-calculate spatial motion of the driving stars with respect to the surrounding stellar population. We studied the radio emission from bow shocks using emission maps and spectral-index measurements, and compared our results with data from catalogues and multi-wavelength emission. Of the 24 targets observed with the VLA in the 4-12 GHz band, six were clearly detected (including two previously reported) and 5 possibly detected. A subset of these were also observed and detected with Effelsberg at 4-8 GHz. The VLA-derived spectral index maps indicate non-thermal emission for most sources, but the statistical uncertainties are large for most sources and all Effelsberg observations indicate thermal emission. Assuming thermal emission, we obtain upper limits on the electron density within the shocked layer. We obtained upper limits on radio emission from the bow shock of Zeta Oph at a similar flux level to predictions from MHD simulations. Our survey marks a significant addition to the ca. 10 previously known radio-emitting bow shocks in the literature, and demonstrates that deep, targeted radio surveys can effectively detect IR-selected bow shocks. Follow-up observations of these targets at lower and higher frequencies are encouraged to determine whether any are non-thermal emitters like the bow shocks of BD+43, BD+60 and LS2355.

      <title>Magnetorotational instability in a solar near-surface mean-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16849v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field when the field is sufficiently strong. The work done by the Lorentz force is positive, so the magnetic field drives kinetic energy and not the other way around, as in a turbulent dynamo. This results in strong kinetic energy production and dissipation, which occurs at the expense of the magnetic energy. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</description>

Abstract: We present the detection of the binary system 2MASS J02132062+3648506 AB using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) archive data observed at 4-8 GHz. The system is a triple consisting of a tight binary ($\sim0.2"$) of two M dwarfs of spectral class M4.5 and M6.5 and a wide T3 brown dwarf companion ($\sim$16.4"). The binary displays coronal and chromospheric activity as traced by previously measured X-ray flux and H$\alpha$ emission. We detect the unresolved binary at a peak flux density of $\sim356\ \mu \mathrm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\sim36$ and determine a radio luminosity of $\mathrm{log}L_R/\mathrm{log}L_\mathrm{bol}\approx-7.76$. The radio emission is quiescent, polarised at a mean circular polarisation fraction $f_\mathrm{c}=45.20 \pm 1.58$ % and exhibits a spectral index $\alpha=-0.44\pm0.07$ . We probe the binary using the Enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) with an angular resolution of $\sim40$ mas at 5 GHz and detect a component at a peak flux density of $\sim90\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ at a SNR $\sim5$ . We propose a gyrosynchrotron origin for the radio emission and estimate a magnetic field strength $B&lt;174.86$ G, an emitting region of size $L&lt;1.54$ times the radius of the M4.5 primary and a plasma number density $n_\mathrm{e}&lt;2.91\times10^5\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The brown dwarf companion is not detected. Additionally, we have analysed observations of 2MASS J04183483+213127, a chromospherically active L5 brown dwarf which is also not detected. Accordingly, we place $3\sigma$ flux density upper limits at $36.9\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ and $42.3\ \mu$Jy $\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ for Stokes I and V respectively.</description>

      <title>Search for Past Stellar Encounters and the Origin of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, the third discovered interstellar object, has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s and exhibits cometary activity. To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.</description>

      <title>Neural Enhancement of the Traditional Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been the cornerstone of operational solar wind forecasting for nearly two decades, owing to its simplicity and physics-based formalism. However, its performance is strongly dependent on several empirical parameters that are typically fixed or tuned manually, limiting its adaptability across varying solar conditions. In this study, we present a neural enhancement to the WSA framework (referred to as WSA+) that systematically optimizes the empirical parameters of the WSA solar wind speed relation using in-situ observations within a differentiable physics-constrained pipeline. The approach operates in two stages: first, a neural optimizer adjusts WSA parameters independently for each Carrington Rotation to better match the observed solar wind data. Then, a neural network learns to predict these optimized speed maps directly from magnetogram-derived features. This enables generalization of the optimization process and allows inference for new solar conditions without manual tuning. The developed WSA+ preserves the interpretability of the original relation while significantly improving the match with OMNI in-situ data across multiple performance metrics, including correlation and error statistics. It consistently outperforms the traditional WSA relation across both low and high solar activity periods, with average improvements of approximately 40 percent. By integrating data-driven learning with physical constraints, WSA+ offers a robust and adaptable enhancement, with immediate utility as a drop-in replacement in global heliospheric modeling pipelines.</description>

      <title>von Karman - Howarth Similarity of Spatial Correlations and the Distribution of Correlation Lengths in Solar Photospheric Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the Sun's photospheric magnetic field are the primary source of the turbulence that can heat and accelerate the solar atmosphere, and thus play an important role in the production and evolution of the solar wind that permeates the heliosphere. A key parameter that characterizes this turbulence is the correlation scale of fluctuations, which determines the injection of turbulent energy into the plasma and the diffusive transport of solar energetic particles. This study employs magnetogram data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory to characterize an ensemble of spatial autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of turbulence in the photosphere. It is shown that the two-point ACFs satisfy the similarity-decay hypothesis of von K\'arm\'an and Howarth, a fundamental property of turbulent systems: rescaling the ACFs by their respective energies and correlation lengths yields a quasi-universal exponential form. The probability distribution function of transverse correlation lengths (\(\lambda\)) is shown to be approximately log-normal, which is consistent with observations of turbulence in the solar wind. A ``mosaic'' of the spatial distribution of \(\lambda\) over the photosphere is presented; the ``quiet Sun'' tends to have \(\lambda\sim 1500\) km (albeit with a wide distribution), which is close to the scale of solar granulation; systematically longer lengths are associated with active regions. A positive correlation is observed between mean magnetic field magnitude and \(\lambda\), and empirical fits quantify this relationship. These results improve our understanding of solar turbulence while providing observational constraints for models that describe turbulence transport from solar and stellar photospheres into their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi II: NIRSpec Spectroscopy and CO Modeling at 285 and 385 Days Past the Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of SN~2024ggi, spanning wavelengths of 1.7--5.5 micron at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. These nebular spectra are dominated by asymmetric emission lines from atomic species including H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe, indicative of an aspherical explosion. The other strong features are molecular CO vibrational bands from the fundamental and first overtone. We introduce a novel, data-driven approach using non-LTE 3D radiative transfer simulations to model the CO emission with high fidelity. This method enables us to constrain the three-dimensional CO distribution and its radial temperature structure. CO formation is found to occur prior to day +285, with subsequent evolution characterized by progressive evaporation. The CO mass decreases from approximately 8.7 to 1.3*E-3 Mo, while the average temperature drops from about 2900 K to 2500 K. Concurrently, the CO distribution transitions from nearly homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast increasing from fc=1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of the CO-emitting region remains nearly constant (v1 = 1200 to 1100 km/s), significantly above the receding photosphere velocity (v(ph) = 500 km/s), suggesting the photosphere resides within Si-rich layers. However, the temperature profile indicates that only a narrow zone reaches the conditions necessary for SiO formation. Due to a lack of observational constraints, SiO clumping is not modeled, and thus, synthetic SiO profiles for mass estimates are not highlighted. We discuss the implications of these findings for dust formation processes in SN~2024ggi.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Evolution of the March 2022 ICME Revealed by Multi-Point Observations of Forbush Decreases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) cause Forbush Decreases (FDs) effects, which are local decreases in background galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Even though FDs can be observed with simple particle instruments, their amplitude and shape provide physical profiles of passing ICMEs. However, in some cases, previous statistical studies of the heliocentric distance dependence of FD changes associated with ICME propagation have found no strong correlation. We need the criteria for evaluating the relationship between ICMEs structure and FD, necessary for FDs statistical analysis. This study investigates the effect of evolutions and interactions of ICMEs on FDs profiles in the inner Solar System, using multipoint comparisons. We focus on multipoint ICME observations by Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft from March 10-16, 2022, when these spacecraft were ideally located for studying the radial and longitudinal evolutions of ICME and accompanying FDs. We compared GCR variations with the multiple in-situ data and ICME model, clarifying the correspondence between the evolution of each ICME structure in radial and azimuthal directions and the depth and gradients of the FD. The radial comparison revealed decreases in FD intensities and gradients associated with the expansion of the ICME. The longitudinal difference found in FD intensity indicates longitudinal variations of the ICMEs shielding effect. These results suggest that accurate multi-point FD comparisons require determining the relationship between the observers position and the inner structure of the passing ICMEs.</description>

      <title>A family of binaries with an extreme mass ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.</description>

      <title>Doubling the Number of Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators: Final Results of Searches for BLAPs in the OGLE Inner Galactic Bulge Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are rare short-period ($\lesssim$80 min) pulsating variable stars exhibiting large-amplitude brightness variations (typically between 0.1 and 0.4 mag). As a recently discovered class of radial-mode pulsators, the origin and nature of these variables remain the subject of ongoing investigations. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of all BLAPs identified in the data of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), including the discovery of 88 new BLAPs in the inner Galactic bulge fields. We performed a systematic search for periodic signals in the $I$-band light curves of more than 400 million stars with magnitudes down to $I = 21$. Our search effectively doubles the number of these variables to almost 200. The detected BLAPs exhibit pulsation periods between roughly 5 and 76 minutes. The analyzed dataset covers a timespan from 2001 to 2024, with some stars observed up to 20,000 times, providing the temporal coverage needed to study period and amplitude variations. We report on three objects that show enormous period changes, at a rate of $10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, which could provide important clues to the evolutionary status of BLAPs. Full dataset is incorporated into the publicly available OGLE Collection of Variable Stars (OCVS), enabling future studies of these enigmatic objects.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of the Young Massive Star Cluster Westerlund 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.</description>

      <title>Can local White Dwarfs constrain Dark Matter interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether nearby white dwarfs (WDs) can constrain dark matter (DM) interactions with ordinary matter. As experimental sensitivity improves, driven by the Gaia mission, the sample volume of nearby WDs has been increasing over recent years. We carefully select a sample of ten cold, isolated, non-magnetic WDs within 13~pc of the Sun. We model their carbon-oxygen interior using a finite temperature relativistic equation of state and model atmospheres to infer their core temperatures. This enables us to perform a thorough estimation of the DM capture rate and evaporation mass using actual astrophysical observations. Given the low local DM density, we focus on DM that annihilates into long-lived mediators, which escape the WD and later decay into photons. While \textit{Fermi}-LAT data shows no significant gamma-ray excess, future telescopes, CTA North \&amp; South, LHAASO, SWGO, could probe DM-nucleon cross sections down to $\sim 10^{-41}~\text{cm}^2$ for DM masses above the TeV scale. Our results are competitive with current direct detection bounds (e.g., LZ) in the multi-TeV regime. This work underscores the importance of systematic WD studies in the broader landscape of DM detection and demonstrates the synergy between astrophysical and terrestrial searches in exploring DM interactions.</description>

      <title>Fractality of open clusters in singles, pairs, and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Close-in faint companions mimicking interferometric hot exozodiacal dust observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Interferometric observations of various nearby main-sequence stars show an unexpected infrared excess, raising the question of its origin. The two dominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as both can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of a star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated the visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the interferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability. We explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges in distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the source of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the companion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common interpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a companion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data, as indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions can still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by reevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a faint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection probability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the previously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion rejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based on Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This highlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former studies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon. In addition, we propose a method for distinguishing both sources of visibility deficit.</description>
