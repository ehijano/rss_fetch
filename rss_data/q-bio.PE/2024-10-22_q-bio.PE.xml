      <title>An Exploration of Modeling Approaches for Capturing Seasonal Transmission in Stochastic Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seasonal variations in the incidence of infectious diseases are a well-established phenomenon, driven by factors such as climate changes, social behaviors, and ecological interactions that influence host susceptibility and transmission rates. While seasonality plays a significant role in shaping epidemiological dynamics, it is often overlooked in both empirical and theoretical studies. Incorporating seasonal parameters into mathematical models of infectious diseases is crucial for accurately capturing disease dynamics, enhancing the predictive power of these models, and developing successful control strategies. This paper highlights key modeling approaches for incorporating seasonality into disease transmission, including sinusoidal functions, periodic piecewise linear functions, Fourier series expansions, Gaussian functions, and data-driven methods, accompanied by real-world examples. Additionally, a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with seasonal transmission is demonstrated through numerical simulations. Important outcome measures, such as the basic and instantaneous reproduction numbers and the probability of a disease outbreak using branching process approximation of the Markov chain, are also presented to illustrate the impact of seasonality on disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>Why aphids are not pests in cacao? An approach based on a predator-prey model with aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied a mean-field predator-prey model with aging to simulate
  the \mbox{interaction} between aphids (\textit{Toxoptera aurantii})
  and syrphid larvae in \mbox{cacao} farms in Ilheus, Bahia. Based on
  the classical predator-prey model, we \mbox{propose} a system of
  differential equations with three rate equations. \mbox{Unlike} the
  original Lotka-Volterra model, our model includes two aphid
  population classes: juveniles (non-breeding) and adult females
  (asexually breeding). We obtained steady-state solutions for
  juvenile and adult populations by \mbox{analyzing} the stability of
  the fixed points as a function of model \mbox{parameters}. The
  results show that the absorbing state (zero prey population) is
  always possible, but not consistently stable. A nonzero stationary
  solution is achievable with appropriate parameter values. Using
  phase diagrams, we analyzed the \mbox{stationary} solution,
  providing a comprehensive understanding of the \mbox{dynamics}
  involved. Simulations on complete graphs yielded \mbox{results}
  closely matching the differential equations. We also
  \mbox{performed} simulations on \mbox{random} networks to highlight
  the influence of \mbox{network} topology on \mbox{system}
  behavior. Our findings highlight the critical role of life-stage
  structure, \mbox{predation}, and spatial variation in stabilizing
  predator-prey \mbox{systems}. This emphasizes the importance of
  network effects in population dynamics and refines the framework for
  biological pest control in agriculture. Ultimately, our research
  contributes to sustainable agricultural practices.</description>

      <title>The exact travelling wave solutions of a KPP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation with the reaction term belonging to the class of functions, which includes that of the (generalized) Fisher equation, for the particular values of the waves speed. The solutions are written in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Tuna and billfish larval distributions in a warming ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tuna and billfish are charismatic pelagic fishes attracting considerable scientific attention due to their ecophysiological and socioeconomic importance. However, the knowledge of their basin-wide spawning and larval habitats, especially in a warming ocean, is limited. This knowledge gap undermines effective fishery management by introducing recruitment uncertainty, which makes population dynamics unpredictable. We fill the gap with a parsimonious geostatistical species-distribution model trained on the largest available dataset on tuna and billfish larvae in the Pacific Ocean. The model reveals (i) the basin-wide seasonal larval distributions over the reference period 1960-85, (ii) the expected impact of ongoing ocean warming on these distributions, and (iii) the biogeochemical factors, such as pH, phosphate concentration, and sea-surface height, that shape the larval habitat. Our findings make a quantum leap in understanding the ecophysiology of tuna and billfish, providing valuable information for future conservation efforts.</description>

      <title>Formulating human risk response in epidemic models: exogenous vs endogenous approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent pandemic emphasized the need to consider the role of human behavior in shaping epidemic dynamics. In particular, it is necessary to extend beyond the classical epidemiological structures to fully capture the interplay between the spread of disease and how people respond. Here, we focus on the challenge of incorporating change in human behavior in the form of ``risk response" into compartmental epidemiological models, where humans adapt their actions in response to their perceived risk of becoming infected. The review examines 37 papers containing over 40 compartmental models, categorizing them into two fundamentally distinct classes: exogenous and endogenous approaches to modeling risk response. While in exogenous approaches, human behavior is often included using different fixed parameter values for certain time periods, endogenous approaches seek for a mechanism internal to the model to explain changes in human behavior as a function of the state of disease. We further discuss two different formulations within endogenous models as implicit versus explicit representation of information diffusion. This analysis provides insights for modelers in selecting an appropriate framework for epidemic modeling.</description>
