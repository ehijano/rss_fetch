      <title>The Simultaneous Operation of a Controllable Segmented Primary Mirror and Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics System part 1 -- Design Concept and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maintenance of primary mirror segment co-phasing is a critical aspect to the operation of segmented telescopes. However, speckle-based measurements of the phasing of the Keck primary have estimated semi-static surface aberrations of approximately 65 nm rms, which were not sensed by the current phasing control system. We propose directly sensing and controlling the primary via the adaptive optics (AO) system, as a Controllable Segmented Primary (CSP), to actively correct its phasing. We develop a methodology for separating the independent controllable signal of the CSP from the rest of the AO system and show estimations of the achievable measurement precision from models of the Keck-II AO system.</description>

      <title>The Simultaneous Operation of a Controllable Segmented Primary Mirror and Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics System part 2 -- Simulated Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are scientific and technological needs to improve the co-phasing of the primary mirrors of segmented telescopes. We have developed a methodology for using the wavefront sensor of an adaptive optics (AO) system to disentangle the phase of a Controllable Segmented Primary mirror (CSP) from the residual phase aberrations to be corrected by the rest of the AO system. We show simulations of the Keck-II AO system where we simultaneously control the CSP surface and a single-conjugate AO system using a pyramid wavefront sensor in a low-bandwidth closed loop, resulting in significantly decreased aberrations on the primary and improvements in the performance of the AO system. Analysis of on-sky telemetry data from the Keck-II AO system validates these simulations and shows that accurate measurements of the primary phase can be made in the presence of real atmospheric turbulence. Ultimately, this work suggests that it is feasible to simultaneously monitor and control the CSP with an AO wavefront sensor while in closed-loop operation and that doing so may significantly improve the performance of the AO system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern X-ray and gamma-ray observatories time-tag detected photons. The distribution of intervals between successive photons may reveal variations of the flux on time scales too short for direct flux measurement of the mean count rate, provided a sufficient number of photons have been detected cumulatively. We demonstrate this with synthetic data and apply to RXTE data from Cyg X-1.</description>

      <title>NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts Phase I Final Report -- A Lunar Long-Baseline UV/Optical Imaging Interferometer: Artemis-enabled Stellar Imager (AeSI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents the findings of a NIAC Phase I feasibility study for the Artemis-enabled Stellar Imager (AeSI), a proposed high-resolution, UV/Optical interferometer designed for deployment on the lunar surface. Its primary science goal is to image the surfaces and interiors of stars with unprecedented detail, revealing new details about their magnetic processes and dynamic evolution and enabling the creation of a truly predictive solar/stellar dynamo model. This capability will transform our understanding of stellar physics and has broad applicability across astrophysics, from resolving the cores of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) to studying supernovae, planetary nebulae, and the late stages of stellar evolution. By leveraging the stable vacuum environment of the Moon and the infrastructure being established for the Artemis Program, AeSI presents a compelling case for a lunar-based interferometer. In this study, the AeSI Team, working with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Integrated Design Center (IDC), has firmly established the feasibility of building and operating a reconfigurable, dispersed aperture telescope (i.e., an interferometer) on the lunar surface. The collaboration produced a credible Baseline design featuring 15 primary mirrors arranged in an elliptical array with a 1 km major axis, with the potential to expand to 30 mirrors and larger array sizes through staged deployments. Additionally, this study identified numerous opportunities for optimization and the necessary trade studies to refine the design further. These will be pursued in follow-up investigations, such as a NIAC Phase II study, to advance the concept toward implementation.</description>

      <title>spike: A tool to drizzle HST, JWST, and Roman PSFs for improved analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point spread functions (PSFs) describe the distribution of light for a pure point source in an astronomical image due to the instrument optics. For deconvolution, as for point source photometry and for source removal, it is key to have an accurate PSF for a particular image. Space-based telescopes can then pose a challenge as their PSFs are informed by their complex construction, and the myriad of pointings and rotations used to capture deep images. These telescopes also capture the highest resolution images of astronomical sources, resolving stars around even relatively distant galaxies. Proper co-addition of PSFs at a specific source position for space-based imaging is then both critical and challenging. This code, spike, generates model PSFs and runs them through the same processing pipeline used to derive deep, co-added images, providing correctly co-added and resampled PSFs for images from the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Real-time station monitor and stationtest pipelines for LOFAR 2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02425v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LOFAR is a low-frequency array distributed across several European countries. Each LOFAR station contains thousands of antennas and associated electronics, making monitoring and thorough testing of those components essential to ensuring station reliability. This paper discusses various anomalies that may arise in LOFAR antennas, tile elements, modems, and summators. We also introduce two diagnostic pipelines designed to detect these anomalies: a real-time station monitoring system and an offline stationtest system. These pipelines provide valuable insights into the operational status of each antenna, issuing alerts to minimize observational disruptions while maximizing station uptime, reliability, and sensitivity. By enhancing the efficiency and stability of LOFAR stations, they also serve as a foundation for future large-scale arrays like SKA-Low. The experience gained from their development and deployment will contribute to the construction and maintenance of SKA-Low, improving monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for large-scale antenna networks. Ultimately, these systems play a crucial role in ensuring continuous observations and maintaining data integrity.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Background Simulations of the 2016 COSI Balloon Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2-5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. As part of its development, in 2016 COSI had a successful 46 day flight on board NASA's Super Pressure Balloon platform. This was a precursor to the COSI Small Explorer (COSI-SMEX) satellite mission that will launch in 2027 into a equatorial low Earth (530 km) orbit. The observation of MeV gamma-rays is dominated by background radiation, especially due to the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. Because the COSI-SMEX detectors will be similar to the ones used for the balloon flight, the balloon measurements provide an important tool for testing and cross-checking our background simulations for the upcoming space mission. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background emission from the 2016 COSI balloon flight. Including a phenomenological shape correction, we obtain an agreement with the data at the 10-20% level for energies between 0.1-1.6 MeV, and we successfully reproduce most of the activation lines induced by cosmic ray interactions.</description>

      <title>Towards a robust R2D2 paradigm for radio-interferometric imaging: revisiting DNN training and architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalisability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. Firstly, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomising Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multi-scan multi-noise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Secondly, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Thirdly, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense connections, weight normalisation, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array (VLA) at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Photometric Calibration &amp; Spectral Validation of the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is one of the seven payloads on board Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). SUIT provides full and partial disk images of the Sun in the 200-400 nm wavelength range. This would help us probe the solar atmosphere at different heights and understand the mass and energy transfer process between its layers. For the first time, SUIT will also help us measure spatially resolved solar spectral irradiance at this wavelength band, which is significant for studying the sun-climate relationships. To perform these studies, it is necessary to photometrically calibrate the payload and validate the spectral coverage of the various bandpasses. We perform the photometric calibration and spectral validation of 8 bandpasses using light of known intensity and spectral coverage. For photometric calibration, the telescope throughput is modeled using sun-as-a-star spectrum from SOLSTICE and SOLSPEC. The modeled throughput is compared with in-lab measurements taken with light of known intensity. The ratio of measured photoelectrons gathered with the modeled prediction agree within 20%. For spectral validation, readings are taken across the transmission spectrum of each filter, keeping adjacent readings independent of each other. The relative intensity measured at each wavelength is seen to trace the modeled telescope bandpass for that filter. These tests could not be performed for filters with bandpasses operating below 250 nm (NB01, BB01 and BB02), primarily due to heavy atmospheric attenuation in these wavelengths leading to decreased SNR of the data. The experimentally measured results agree closely with the modeled values, validating SUIT's optical performance and presenting the reliability of the developed throughput model.</description>

      <title>Trust, but verify: Reducing artificial light emissions and monitoring compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to reduce light pollution we have to reduce the overall amount of artificial light emissions. This is a consequence of the basic rules governing the propagation of light in the terrestrial environment. In this work I revisit the physical laws causing that (i) "all" artificial light emitted outdoors is lost or pollutant, (ii) the negative effects of light pollution depend monotonically on the local concentration of photons of anthropogenic origin, and (iii) this concentration depends linearly on the total artificial light emissions, weighted by the light pollution propagation functions. Setting total emission limits becomes necessary in order to ensure that the negative effects of light pollution do not surpass red-lines of unacceptable degradation of the natural night. Once these red-lines are socially agreed, monitoring compliance becomes a relevant task. Several complementary methods for assessing total light emissions are being used nowadays, including public inventories of installed lights, direct radiance measurements from ground or low Earth orbit satellites, and scattered radiance measurements using ground based detectors (night sky brightness monitoring). While updated administrative inventories could in principle be trusted, independent verification is a must. The required measurements pose in turn significant challenges: we discuss here how the variability of the terrestrial atmosphere sets a lower limit on the minimum emission changes that can be reliably detected by measurements, and propose some ways to improve this performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the basic instrument detrending software for the NIRWALS spectrograph on the SALT telescope. Its basic purpose is to process multiple non-destructive reads of increasing exposure time into a final image reflecting the observed source intensity as expressed in counts (or electrons) per second, including its uncertainty. The output products of this pipeline can then be used to as input for follow-up data processing to apply wavelength solutions and extract fluxes for individual fibers. All pipeline code is implemented in python and can be obtained via common portals such as PyPI and GitHub. Additional information on how to use the code is available online at nirwals.readthedocs.io</description>

      <title>Probing the Gaia atmospheric parameters of stars in globular clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous stellar surveys have been or will provide photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data for a large number of stars in the Milky Way and neighbouring galaxies. Modern data processing tools and analysis methods are needed to deal with these data sets and obtain accurate and precise results. In this context, we are developing a new spectroscopic analysis pipeline based on the differential analysis method. The CHEmical Survey analysis System (CHESS) aims to automate the steps needed to obtain high-quality stellar parameters and abundances from large samples of spectra. To automatically identify the spectra of similar stars that are suitable for a differential analysis, CHESS first performs what we call a similarity analysis by directly using the observed spectra. This step of analysis uses unsupervised machine learning algorithms (such as dimensionality reduction methods). To validate the findings, we used atmospheric parameters from several catalogues (in particular those available in Gaia DR3). Alternatively, such a similarity analysis also serves as a consistency check of the atmospheric parameters in these catalogues. Here, we present our method for finding similar stars in globular clusters and the first preliminary results of their atmospheric parameters.</description>

      <title>Building Machine Learning Challenges for Anomaly Detection in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discoveries are often made by finding a pattern or object that was not predicted by the known rules of science. Oftentimes, these anomalous events or objects that do not conform to the norms are an indication that the rules of science governing the data are incomplete, and something new needs to be present to explain these unexpected outliers. The challenge of finding anomalies can be confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge of the known scientific behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on the data to look for deviations. When utilizing machine learning, this presents a particular challenge since we require that the model not only understands scientific data perfectly but also recognizes when the data is inconsistent and out of the scope of its trained behavior. In this paper, we present three datasets aimed at developing machine learning-based anomaly detection for disparate scientific domains covering astrophysics, genomics, and polar science. We present the different datasets along with a scheme to make machine learning challenges around the three datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we present an approach that generalizes to future machine learning challenges, enabling the possibility of large, more compute-intensive challenges that can ultimately lead to scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>Residual test to search for microlensing signatures in strongly lensed gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave signal encounters a massive object, such as a galaxy or galaxy cluster, it undergoes strong gravitational lensing, producing multiple copies of the original signal. These strongly lensed signals exhibit identical waveform morphology in the frequency domain, allowing analysis without the need for complex lens models. However, stellar fields and dark matter substructures within the galactic lens introduce microlensing effects that alter individual signal morphologies. Identifying these microlensing signatures is computationally challenging within Bayesian frameworks. In this study, we propose a novel residual test to efficiently search for microlensing signatures by leveraging the fact that current Bayesian inference pipelines are optimized solely for the strong lensing hypothesis. Using cross-correlation techniques, we investigate the microlensing-induced deviations from the strong hypothesis, which are imprinted in the residuals. Our simulated signals from realistic microlensing populations reveal that while most events exhibit small mismatches, a fraction exhibit significant deviations. We find that 31% (55%) and 45% (65%) of microlensed events with mismatch &gt; 0.03 and &gt; 0.1, respectively, can be discerned with O4 (O5) detector sensitivities, which demonstrates that high-mismatch events are more likely to be identified as microlensed. Including all events from a realistic population, 12% (21.5%) are identifiable with O4 (O5) sensitivity using our approach.</description>

      <title>Deriving Stellar Properties, Distances, and Reddenings using Photometry and Astrometry with BRUTUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present brutus, an open source Python package for quickly deriving stellar properties, distances, and reddenings to stars based on grids of stellar models constrained by photometric and astrometric data. We outline the statistical framework for deriving these quantities, its implementation, and various Galactic priors over the 3-D distribution of stars, stellar properties, and dust extinction (including $R_V$ variation). We establish a procedure to empirically calibrate MIST v1.2 isochrones by using open clusters to derive corrections to the effective temperatures and radii of the isochrones, which reduces systematic errors on the lower main sequence. We also describe and apply a method to estimate photometric offsets between stellar models and observed data using nearby, low-reddening field stars. We perform a series of tests on mock and real data to examine parameter recovery with MIST under different modeling assumptions, illustrating that brutus is able to recover distances and other stellar properties using optical to near-infrared photometry and astrometry. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/joshspeagle/brutus.</description>

      <title>Inferring Galactic Parameters from Chemical Abundances with Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic chemical abundances provide crucial insights into fundamental galactic parameters, such as the high-mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF) and the normalization of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rates. Constraining these parameters is essential for advancing our understanding of stellar feedback, metal enrichment, and galaxy formation processes. However, traditional Bayesian inference techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), are computationally prohibitive when applied to large datasets of modern stellar surveys. We leverage simulation-based-inference (SBI) as a scalable, robust, and efficient method for constraining galactic parameters from stellar chemical abundances and demonstrate its the advantages over HMC in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness against model misspecifications. We combine a Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model, CHEMPY, with a neural network emulator and a Neural Posterior Estimator (NPE) to train our SBI pipeline. Mock datasets are generated using CHEMPY, including scenarios with mismatched nucleosynthetic yields, with additional tests conducted on data from a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. SBI results are benchmarked against HMC-based inference, focusing on computational performance, accuracy, and resilience to systematic discrepancies. SBI achieves a $\sim75,600\times$ speed-up compared to HMC, reducing inference runtime from $\gtrsim42$ hours to mere seconds for thousands of stars. Inference on $1,000$ stars yields precise estimates for the IMF slope ($\alpha_{\rm IMF} = -2.298 \pm 0.002$) and SN Ia normalization ($\log_{10}(N_{\rm Ia}) = -2.885 \pm 0.003$), deviating less than 0.05% from the ground truth. SBI also demonstrates similar robustness to model misspecification than HMC, recovering accurate parameters even with alternate yield tables or data from a cosmological simulation.

      <title>High-frequency magnetic response measurement of test mass with a fluxgate magnetometer for gravitational wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For space-borne gravitational wave detectors,such as LISA and TianQin ,the disturbance caused by the coupling of test masses and the external magnetic fields is one of the main sources of the residual acceleration noise. Although the detection frequency band is from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz, magnetic fields with frequencies higher than 1 Hz can still contribute to the noise through down conversion effect. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the AC magnetic susceptibility or magnetic response of the test mass at higher frequency for the evaluation of the magnetic noise. In this work, we propose a magnetic field response measurement method by directly probing the induced magnetic field of the test mass placed in a spatially uniform magnetic field. The frequency can be measured up to 1500 Hz, satisfying the requirement of space-borne gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Assessing Galaxy Rotation Kinematics: Insights from Convolutional Neural Networks on Velocity Variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing galaxies as either fast or slow rotators plays a vital role in understanding the processes behind galaxy formation and evolution. Standard techniques, which are based on the $\lambda_R$-spin parameter obtained from stellar kinematics, frequently face difficulties to classify fast and slow rotators accurately. These challenges arise particularly in cases where galaxies have complex interaction histories or exhibit significant morphological diversity. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on classifying galaxy rotation kinematics based on stellar kinematic maps from the SAMI survey. Our results show that the optimal CNN architecture achieves an accuracy and precision of approximately 91% and 95% on the test dataset, respectively. Subsequently, we apply our trained model to classify previously unknown rotator galaxies for which traditional statistical tools have been unable to determine whether they exhibit fast or slow rotation, such as certain irregular galaxies or those in dense clusters. We also used Integrated Gradients (IG) to reveal the crucial kinematic features that influenced the CNN's classifications. This research highlights the power of CNNs to improve our comprehension of galaxy dynamics and emphasizes their potential to contribute to upcoming large-scale Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) surveys.</description>

      <title>Radiation-magnetohydrodynamics with MPI-AMRVAC using flux-limited diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Radiation plays a significant role in solar and astrophysical environments as it may constitute a sizeable fraction of the energy density, momentum flux, and the total pressure. Modelling the dynamic interaction between radiation and magnetized plasmas in such environments is an intricate and computationally costly task. Aims. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the capabilities of the open-source parallel, block-adaptive computational framework MPI-AMRVAC, in solving equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), and to present benchmark test cases relevant for radiation-dominated magnetized plasmas. Methods. The existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and flux-limited diffusion (FLD) radiative-hydrodynamics physics modules are combined to solve the equations of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) on block-adaptive finite volume Cartesian meshes in any dimensionality. Results. We introduce and validate several benchmark test cases such as steady radiative MHD shocks, radiation-damped linear MHD waves, radiation-modified Riemann problems and a multi-dimensional radiative magnetoconvection case. We recall the basic governing Rankine-Hugoniot relations for shocks and the dispersion relation for linear MHD waves in the presence of optically thick radiation fields where the diffusion limit is reached. The RMHD system allows for 8 linear wave types, where the classical 7-wave MHD picture (entropy and three wave pairs for slow, Alfven and fast) is augmented with a radiative diffusion mode. Conclusions. The MPI-AMRVAC code now has the capability to perform multidimensional RMHD simulations with mesh adaptation making it well-suited for larger scientific applications to study magnetized matter-radiation interactions in solar and stellar interiors and atmospheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio astronomy observatories, such as the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia, try to limit radio frequency interference to observe incredibly faint astronomical signals. These protective measures include placing observatories in geographically remote locations, the implementation of radio-frequency-interference-free quiet zones, or removal of interference in data processing. In 2018, we set out to explore how necessary radio-quiet zones are, by studying the radio frequency emission around the Observatory and around our local environment in Calgary, Alberta. We studied five well-used radio frequency bands and found the emission to be variable and environment dependent. While the radio frequency environment has changed since then, as a consequence of increased satellite activity and other forms of emission, we present these results as documentation of the past environment with the aim to redo the measurements. Overall, as there is use from both public and private services across the radio spectrum, protective measures at astronomical observatories are essential to reduce radio frequency interference.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Residual Charge Images in LSST Camera e2v CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LSST Camera CCDs produced by the manufacturer e2v exhibit strong and novel residual charge images when exposed to bright sources. These manifest in images following bright exposures both in the same pixel areas as the bright source, and in the pixels trailing between the source and the serial register. Both of these pose systematic challenges to the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time instrument signature removal. The latter trail region is especially impactful as it affects a much larger pixel area in a less well defined position. In our study of this effect at UC Davis, we imaged bright spots to characterize these residual charge effects. We find a strong dependence of the residual charge on the parallel clocking scheme, including the relative levels of the clocking voltages, and the timing of gate phase transition during the parallel transfer. Our study points to independent causes of residual charge in the bright spot region and trail region. We propose potential causes in both regions and suggest methodologies for minimizing residual charge. We consider the trade-offs to these methods including decreasing the camera's full well and dynamic range at the high end. Some of these results and suggestions have been reviewed by the camera commissioning team and may result in changes made to the clocking voltage scheme on the LSST Camera.</description>

      <title>ODS: A self-reporting system for radio telescopes to coexist with adaptive satellite constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations bring broadband internet and cellular service to the most remote locations on the planet. Unfortunately, many of these locations also host some of the world's best optical and radio astronomy (RA) observatories. With the number of LEO satellites expected to increase by an order of magnitude in the upcoming decade, satellite downlink radio frequency interference (RFI) is a growing concern in protected radio-quiet areas like the United States National Radio Quiet Zone. When these satellites transmit in the spectrum near protected RA bands, undesired out-of-band emission can leak into these protected bands and impact scientific observations. In this paper, we present a self-reporting system - Operational Data Sharing (ODS) - which enables mutual awareness by publishing radio telescopes' operational information to a protected database that is available to satellite operators through a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API). Satellite operators can use the ODS data to adapt their downlink tasking algorithms in real time to avoid overwhelming sensitive RA facilities, particularly, through the novel Telescope Boresight Avoidance (TBA) technique. Preliminary results from recent experiments between the NRAO and the SpaceX Starlink teams demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODS and TBA in reducing downlink RFI in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array's observations in the 1990-1995 MHz and 10.7-12.7 GHz bands. This automated ODS system is beginning to be implemented by other RA facilities and could be utilized by other satellite operators in the near future.</description>

      <title>The effect of spectroscopic binning on atmospheric retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the JWST offering higher resolution data in space-based transmission spectroscopy, understanding the capabilities of our current atmospheric retrieval pipelines is essential. These new data cover wider wavelength ranges and at much higher spectral resolution than previous instruments have been able to offer. Therefore, it is often appealing to bin spectra to fewer points, better constrained in their transit depth, before using them as inputs for atmospheric retrievals. As such, we produce a simulation replicating the observations of WASP-39b by the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument on board JWST using the PRISM dispersion element. Then, we assess the accuracy and consistency of retrievals while varying both the resolution and the average photometric error of this simulated spectrum. We repeat this analysis on three different simulation setups where each includes an opaque cloud layer at a different height in the atmosphere. In agreement with previous studies, we find that a much greater resolution is needed in the case of a high cloud deck since features are already heavily muted by the presence of the clouds. In the other two cases, there are large 'safe zones' in the parameter space where accurate estimations are made. If these maps can be generalized, they could be used to inform future observations on how long to observe a given target in order to achieve the most accurate retrieval results. We also find that the resolution required to fully resolve the degeneracies between the parameters contributing to the spectra is much greater than that needed to constrain the marginalized posterior distributions for each parameter individually.</description>

      <title>Development of MMC-based lithium molybdate cryogenic calorimeters for AMoRE-II</title>

Abstract: The AMoRE collaboration searches for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{100}$Mo using molybdate scintillating crystals via low temperature thermal calorimetric detection. The early phases of the experiment, AMoRE-pilot and AMoRE-I, have demonstrated competitive discovery potential. Presently, the AMoRE-II experiment, featuring a large detector array with about 90 kg of $^{100}$Mo isotope, is under construction. This paper discusses the baseline design and characterization of the lithium molybdate cryogenic calorimeters to be used in the AMoRE-II detector modules. The results from prototype setups that incorporate new housing structures and two different crystal masses (316 g and 517 - 521 g), operated at 10 mK temperature, show energy resolutions (FWHM) of 7.55 - 8.82 keV at the 2.615 MeV $^{208}$Tl $\gamma$ line, and effective light detection of 0.79 - 0.96 keV/MeV. The simultaneous heat and light detection enables clear separation of alpha particles with a discrimination power of 12.37 - 19.50 at the energy region around $^6$Li(n, $\alpha$)$^3$H with Q-value = 4.785 MeV. Promising detector performances were demonstrated at temperatures as high as 30 mK, which relaxes the temperature constraints for operating the large AMoRE-II array.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks like anomaly detection, unsupervised classification, and similarity searches in high-energy data sets. This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard &lt;10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</description>
