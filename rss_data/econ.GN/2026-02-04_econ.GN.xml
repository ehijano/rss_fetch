      <title>Applications of structural equation modeling and mathematical statistics to the triggering mechanism of a class of liquors consumer behaviors in Sichuan province</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) systematically validated hierarchical pathways among multiple factors by constructing a dual framework integrating latent variable measurement and path analysis, utilizing covariance matrices derived from online questionnaires of Wuliangye consumers in Sichuan Province. Statistical analysis quantified path coefficient significance through maximum likelihood estimation, revealing via factor loadings and goodness-of-fit tests that consumer ethnocentrism directly promotes purchase intention, while simultaneously refuting the null hypothesis regarding perceived behavioral control-thus deconstructing the "trigger-transmission" causal chain among variables. Crucially, SEM findings revealed environmental stimuli as the predominant factor, indirectly influencing purchasing behavior through perceived value, contrary to existing literature asserting equal impacts from consumer ethnocentrism, environmental stimuli, and perceived behavioral control. Statistical evidence further demonstrated higher online purchase frequency for premium Wuliangye liquor, aligning with Generation Z's e-commerce preferences. By implementing stricter website-based participant screening than prior studies, this research optimized the analytical model, yielding data-driven strategic recommendations: strengthening e-commerce platforms, enhancing promotional expertise, leveraging cultural localization, and prioritizing premium product development. These actionable insights significantly advance sales optimization strategies for Wuliangye products in Sichuan's dynamic market.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Common-Pool Resources: A Comprehensive Review of Bioeconomics, Strategic Interaction, and Complex Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The governance of common-pool resources-resource systems characterized by high subtractability of yield and difficulty of exclusion-constitutes one of the most persistent and intricate challenges in the fields of economics, ecology, and applied mathematics. This comprehensive review delineates the historical and theoretical evolution of the mathematical frameworks developed to analyze, predict, and manage these systems. We trace the intellectual trajectory from the early, deterministic bioeconomic models of the mid-20th century, which established the fundamental tension between individual profit maximization and collective efficiency, to the contemporary era of complex coupled human-environment system models. Our analysis systematically dissects the formalization of the "Tragedy of the Commons" through the lens of classical cooperative and non-cooperative game theory, examining how the N-person Prisoner's Dilemma and Nash Equilibrium concepts provided the initial, albeit pessimistic, predictive baseline. We subsequently explore the "Ostrom Turn," which necessitated the integration of institutional realism-specifically monitoring, graduated sanctions, and communication-into formal game-theoretic structures. The review further investigates the relaxation of rationality assumptions via evolutionary game theory and behavioral economics, highlighting the destabilizing roles of prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting. Finally, we synthesize recent advances in stochastic differential equations and agent-based computational economics, which capture the critical roles of spatial heterogeneity, noise-induced regime shifts, and early warning signals of collapse. By unifying these diverse mathematical threads, this review elucidates the shifting paradigm from static optimization to dynamic resilience in the management of the commons.</description>

      <title>The long-run returns to breastfeeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that the mid-20th century was characterised by a considerable reduction in breastfeeding rates, reducing from over 80% in the late 1930s to just over 40% only three decades later. We investigate how maternal breastfeeding during this period has shaped offspring health and human capital outcomes in the UK. We use a within-family design, comparing children who were breastfed to their sibling(s) who were not. Our results show that breastfeeding increases adult height, as well as fluid intelligence, but does not affect educational attainment, nor adult BMI. In further analyses, we examine whether and how this impact varies with individuals' genetic "predisposition" for these outcomes, proxied by the outcome-specific polygenic index. We find that the "height-returns" to breastfeeding are larger among those genetically predisposed to be taller, with no genetic heterogeneity for the other outcomes, though we note that power in the within-family GxE analysis is more limited. Overall, our estimates suggest that breastfeeding plays a non-negligible role in child development.</description>

      <title>Confrontation with the West and Long-Run Economic and Institutional Outcomes: Evidence from Iran</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the long-run economic and institutional consequences of Iran's confrontation with the West, treating the 2006-2007 strategic shift as the onset of a sustained confrontation regime rather than a discrete sanctions episode. Using synthetic control and generalized synthetic control methods, I construct transparent counterfactuals for Iran's post-confrontation trajectory from a donor pool of countries with continuously normalized relations with the West. I find large, persistent losses in real GDP and GDP per capita, accompanied by sharp declines in foreign direct investment, trade integration, and non-oil exports. These economic effects coincide with substantial and durable deterioration in political stability, rule of law, and control of corruption. Magnitude calculations imply cumulative output losses comparable to civil-war settings, despite the absence of internal armed conflict. The results highlight confrontation as a deep and persistent economic and institutional shock, extending the literature beyond short-run sanctions effects to sustained geopolitical isolation.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Genetic Footprints of the UK National Health Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The establishment of the UK National Health Service (NHS) in July 1948 was one of the most consequential health policy interventions of the twentieth century, providing universal and free access to medical care and substantially expanding maternal and infant health services. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of the NHS introduction on early-life mortality and we test whether survival is selective. We adopt a regression discontinuity design under local randomization, comparing individuals born just before and just after July 1948. Leveraging newly digitized weekly death records, we document a significant decline in stillbirths and infant mortality following the introduction of the NHS, the latter driven primarily by reductions in deaths from congenital conditions and diarrhea. We then use polygenic indexes (PGIs), fixed at conception, to track changes in population composition, showing that cohorts born at or after the NHS introduction exhibit higher PGIs associated with contextually-adverse traits (e.g., depression, COPD, and preterm birth) and lower PGIs associated with contextually-valued traits (e.g., educational attainment, self-rated health, and pregnancy length), with effect sizes as large as 7.5% of a standard deviation. These results based on the UK Biobank data are robust to family-based designs and replicate in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Effects are strongest in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and among males. This novel evidence on the existence and magnitude of selective survival highlights how large-scale public policies can leave a persistent imprint on population composition and generate long-term survival biases.</description>

      <title>Decision-oriented benchmarking to transform AI weather forecast access: Application to the Indian monsoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) models now often outperform traditional physics-based models on common metrics while requiring orders-of-magnitude less computing resources and time. Open-access AIWP models thus hold promise as transformational tools for helping low- and middle-income populations make decisions in the face of high-impact weather shocks. Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression. This decision-oriented benchmarking framework provides a key component of a blueprint for harnessing the power of AIWP models to help large vulnerable populations adapt to weather shocks in the face of climate variability and change.</description>

      <title>Scale Economies and Aggregate Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to investigate the link between rising scale economies and stagnating productivity. Our model features heterogeneous firms, imperfect competition, and firm selection. We demonstrate that scale economies generated by fixed costs have distinct impacts on aggregate productivity compared to those driven by returns to scale (slope of marginal cost). Using UK data, we estimate long-run increases in both fixed costs and returns to scale. Our model implies that this should increase aggregate productivity through improved firm selection and resource allocation. However, increasing markups can offset the productivity gain. Higher markups cushion low-productivity firms' revenues, allowing them to survive, and constrain firm output, which limits exploitation of scale economies.</description>

      <title>Adventures in Demand Analysis Using AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper advances empirical demand analysis by integrating multimodal product representations derived from artificial intelligence (AI). Using a detailed dataset of toy cars on textit{Amazon.com}, we combine text descriptions, images, and tabular covariates to represent each product using transformer-based embedding models. These embeddings capture nuanced attributes, such as quality, branding, and visual characteristics, that traditional methods often struggle to summarize. Moreover, we fine-tune these embeddings for causal inference tasks. We show that the resulting embeddings substantially improve the predictive accuracy of sales ranks and prices and that they lead to more credible causal estimates of price elasticity. Notably, we uncover strong heterogeneity in price elasticity driven by these product-specific features. Our findings illustrate that AI-driven representations can enrich and modernize empirical demand analysis. The insights generated may also prove valuable for applied causal inference more broadly.</description>

      <title>Are Princelings Truly Busted? Evaluating Transaction Discounts in China's Land Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper replicates Chen and Kung's 2019 analysis ($The$ $Quarterly$ $Journal$ $of$ $Economics$ 134(1): 185-226). Inspecting the data reveals that nearly one-third of transactions (388,903 out of 1,208,621) are perfect duplicates of other rows, excluding the transaction number. The analysis on the data sans duplicates replicates their statistically significant princeling effect, robust across various specifications. Further analysis reveals a disagreement between Chen and Kung's text and code: the paper's ''logarithm of area'' is actually area ($\text{m}^2$) divided by one million. This therefore necessitates a reinterpretation of the estimation results, revealing that the princeling effect is extremely large.</description>

      <title>Regulatory Markets: The Future of AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04914v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Appropriately regulating artificial intelligence is an increasingly urgent and widespread policy challenge. We identify two primary, competing problem. First is a technical deficit: Legislatures and regulatory face significant challenges in rapidly translating conventional command-and-control legal requirements into technical requirements. Second is a democratic deficit: Over-reliance on industry to provide technical standards fails to ensure that the many values-based decisions that must be made to shape AI development and deployment are made by democratically accountable public, not private, actors. We propose a solution: regulatory markets, in which governments require the targets of regulation to purchase regulatory services from a government-licensed private regulator. This approach to AI regulation could overcome the limitations of both command-and-control regulation and excessive delegation to industry. Regulatory markets could enable governments to establish policy priorities for the regulation of AI while relying on market forces and industry R&amp;D efforts to pioneer the technical methods of regulation that best achieve policymakers' stated objectives.</description>
