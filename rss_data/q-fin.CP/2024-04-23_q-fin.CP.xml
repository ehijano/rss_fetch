      <title>On Risk-Sensitive Decision Making Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a risk-sensitive decision-making problem under uncertainty. It considers a decision-making process that unfolds over a fixed number of stages, in which a decision-maker chooses among multiple alternatives, some of which are deterministic and others are stochastic. The decision-maker's cumulative value is updated at each stage, reflecting the outcomes of the chosen alternatives. After formulating this as a stochastic control problem, we delineate the necessary optimality conditions for it. Two illustrative examples from optimal betting and inventory management are provided to support our theory.</description>

      <title>Internet sentiment exacerbates intraday overtrading, evidence from A-Share market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market fluctuations caused by overtrading are important components of systemic market risk. This study examines the effect of investor sentiment on intraday overtrading activities in the Chinese A-share market. Employing high-frequency sentiment indices inferred from social media posts on the Eastmoney forum Guba, the research focuses on constituents of the CSI 300 and CSI 500 indices over a period from 01/01/2018, to 12/30/2022. The empirical analysis indicates that investor sentiment exerts a significantly positive impact on intraday overtrading, with the influence being more pronounced among institutional investors relative to individual traders. Moreover, sentiment-driven overtrading is found to be more prevalent during bull markets as opposed to bear markets. Additionally, the effect of sentiment on overtrading is observed to be more pronounced among individual investors in large-cap stocks compared to small- and mid-cap stocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for solving Black-Scholes PDEs for high-dimensional option pricing in finance and its complexity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

      <title>A novel approach for quantum financial simulation and quantum state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is vital in quantum computing and information processing. The ability to accurately and reliably prepare specific quantum states is essential for various applications. One of the promising applications of quantum computers is quantum simulation. This requires preparing a quantum state representing the system we are trying to simulate. This research introduces a novel simulation algorithm, the multi-Split-Steps Quantum Walk (multi-SSQW), designed to learn and load complicated probability distributions using parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) with a variational solver on classical simulators. The multi-SSQW algorithm is a modified version of the split-steps quantum walk, enhanced to incorporate a multi-agent decision-making process, rendering it suitable for modeling financial markets. The study provides theoretical descriptions and empirical investigations of the multi-SSQW algorithm to demonstrate its promising capabilities in probability distribution simulation and financial market modeling. Harnessing the advantages of quantum computation, the multi-SSQW models complex financial distributions and scenarios with high accuracy, providing valuable insights and mechanisms for financial analysis and decision-making. The multi-SSQW's key benefits include its modeling flexibility, stable convergence, and instantaneous computation. These advantages underscore its rapid modeling and prediction potential in dynamic financial markets.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibria in Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In response to the global climate crisis, governments worldwide are introducing legislation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to help mitigate environmental catastrophes. One method to encourage emission reductions is to incentivize carbon capturing and carbon reducing projects while simultaneously penalising excess GHG output. Firms that invest in such projects or reduce their emissions can receive offset credits (OCs) in return. They may then use OCs for regulatory purposes to offset emissions in a compliance period or trade them. Here, we present a novel market framework and characterise the optimal behaviour of GHG OC market participants in both single-player and two-player settings. The single player setting is posed as an optimal stopping and control problem, while the two-player setting is posed as optimal stopping and mixed-Nash equilibria problem. We demonstrate the importance of acting optimally using numerical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations and explore the differences between the homogeneous and heterogeneous players.</description>
