      <title>The Geometry of Rough Path Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe $H^p(V)$, a subset of $p$-rough path space $\Omega_p(V)$ which is a vector space under an addition operation $\boxplus$ and a scalar multiplication $\odot$. We show that the domain of $\boxplus$ can be extended to $\Omega_p(V)\times H^p(V)$, allowing any $p$-rough path $X$ to be additively perturbed by an $H\in H^p(V)$. We prove associativity $(X\boxplus H)\boxplus \tilde H = X\boxplus (H\boxplus \tilde H)$ and trivial kernel $X\boxplus H = X \Leftrightarrow H = 1$, where $1$ is the additive zero in $(H^p(V),\boxplus,\odot)$. Finally, we show that enlarging $H^p(V)$ to almost rough paths $H^{am,p}(V)$ does not enlarge the set of displacements of a given $X$, i.e. $\{X\boxplus H: H\in H^p(V)\}=\{X\boxplus H: H\in H^{am,p}(V)\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard proof of the equivalence of Fourier type on \(\mathbb R^d\) and on the torus \(\mathbb T^d\) is usually stated in terms of an implicit constant which can be expressed in terms of the global minimiser of the functions \[f_r(x)=\sum_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}\left|\frac{\sin(\pi(x+m))}{\pi(x+m)}\right|^{2r},\qquad x\in [0,1], \ r\ge 1.\] The aim of this note is to provide a short proof of a result of the authors which states that each \(f_r\) takes a global minimum at the point \(x = \frac12\).</description>

      <title>Quadratic discrepancy estimates for probability measures on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of quadratic discrepancy for finite point sets on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb H^n$ with respect to upper Ahlfors regular probability measures. For a natural family of test sets given by left translations and dilations of cylindrically defined neighborhoods, we introduce an $L^2$-discrepancy and establish a Roth-type lower bound depending on the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb H^n$.
  This result extends classical discrepancy estimates from the Euclidean and compact settings to a non-commutative, step-two nilpotent Lie group. It should be viewed as a first step toward the development of a discrepancy theory on the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Directional polynomial frames on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for the construction of polynomial frames in $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, $d \geq 3$, where the frame functions are obtained as rotated versions of an initial sequence of polynomials $\Psi^j$, $j\in \mathbb{N}_0$. The rotations involved are discretized using suitable quadrature rules. This framework includes classical constructions such as spherical needlets and directional wavelet systems, and at the same time permits the systematic design of new frames with adjustable spatial localization, directional sensitivity, and computational complexity. We show that a number of frame properties can be characterized in terms of simple, easily verifiable conditions on the Fourier coefficients of the functions $\Psi^j$. Extending an earlier result for zonal systems, we establish sufficient conditions under which the frame functions are optimally localized in space with respect to a spherical uncertainty principle, thus making the corresponding systems a viable tool for position-frequency analyses. To conclude this article, we explicitly discuss examples of well-localized and highly directional polynomial frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using continuation methods and bifurcation theory, we study the exact multiplicity of periodic solutions, and the global solution structure, for periodic problems of first order. The results are applied to a population model with fishing, and to the existence and stability of limit cycles. We also describe in detail our numerical computations of curves of periodic solutions, and of limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Rankin--Cohen brackets in Representation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rankin--Cohen brackets provide a basic example of ``non-elementary" differential symmetry breaking operators. They can be interpreted as bi-differential operators remarkable for reflecting the structure of fusion rules for holomorphic discrete series representations of the Lie group $SL(2,\mathbb R)$ and are intimately connected to classical special polynomials.
  In this introductory article, we explore the combinatorial structure of these operators and discuss a general framework for constructing their higher-dimensional analogues from the representation-theoretic perspective on branching problems. The exposition is based on lectures delivered by the authors during the thematic semester ``Representation Theory and Noncommutative Geometry", held in Spring 2025 at the Henri Poincar\'e Institute in Paris.</description>

      <title>A fully diagonalized spectral method on the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main objective in this work is to show how Sobolev orthogonal polynomials emerge as a useful tool within the framework of spectral methods for boundary-value problems. The solution of a boundary-value problem for a stationary Schr\"odinger equation on the unit ball can be studied from a variational perspective. In this variational formulation, a Sobolev inner product naturally arises. As test functions, we consider the linear space of the polynomials satisfying the boundary conditions on the sphere, and a basis of mutually orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Sobolev inner product is provided. The basis of the proposed method is given in terms of spherical harmonics and univariate Sobolev orthogonal polynomials. The connection formula between these Sobolev orthogonal polynomials and the classical orthogonal polynomials on the ball is established. Consequently, the Sobolev Fourier coefficients of a function satisfying the boundary value problem are recursively derived. Finally, one numerical experiment is presented.</description>

      <title>On the dimension drop for harmonic measure on uniformly non-flat Ahlfors-David regular boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend earlier results of Azzam on the dimension drop of the harmonic measure for a domain $\Omega\subset \R^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$, with dimensional Ahlfors regular boundary $\partial\Omega$ of dimension $s$ with $n-1-\delta_0 \leq s\leq n-1$, that is uniformly non flat. Here $\delta_0$ is a small positive constant dependent on the parameters of the problem. Our novel construction relies on elementary geometric and potential theoretic considerations. We avoid the use of Riesz transforms and compactness arguments, and also give quantitative bounds on the $\delta_0$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Determinantally equivalent nonzero functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem raised in [Marco Stevens, Equivalent symmetric kernels of determinantal point processes, RMTA, 10(03):2150027, 2021] concerning the extension of its main result to the more general (potentially non-symmetric) setting. We construct a counterexample disproving the conjecture proposed in the paper, and subsequently solve it under some additional minor assumptions that preclude such counterexamples.
  The problem is plainly stated as follows: Let $\Lambda$ be a set and $\mathbb{F}$ a field, and suppose that $K,Q:\Lambda^2\to\mathbb{F}$ are two functions such that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\in\Lambda$, the determinants of matrices $(K(x_i,x_j))_{1\leq i,j\leq n}$ and $(Q(x_i,x_j))_{1\leq i,j\leq n}$ agree. What are all the possible transformations that transform $Q$ into $K$? In [Marco Stevens, Equivalent symmetric kernels of determinantal point processes, RMTA, 10(03):2150027, 2021] the following two were conjectured: $(Tf)(x,y)=f(y,x)$; and $(Tf)(x,y)=g(x)g(y)^{-1}f(x,y)$ for some nowhere-zero function $g$. In the same paper, this conjectured classification is verified in the case of symmetric functions $K$ and $Q$. By extending the graph-theoretic techniques of the paper, we show that under some surprisingly simple and natural conditions the conjecture remains valid even with the symmetry constraints relaxed.
  By taking $\Lambda$ finite, the above problem, furthermore, reduces to that between two square matrices investigated in [Raphael Loewy, Principal minors and diagonal similarity of matrices, Linear Algebra and its Applications 78 (1986), 23--64]. Hence, our paper presents a simple non-linear-algebraic proof that uses only some elementary combinatorics and three simple algebraic identities involving $3$-cycles and $4$-cycles.</description>

      <title>Operational Methods Applied to the Spherical Mean and X-Ray Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the framework of operational calculus to derive the operators associated with the spherical mean and a class of related averaging means of a function in $n$-dimensional space. Beginning with the classical definition of the spherical mean, we obtain a compact operator representation in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions of the Laplacian. This operator-based formulation provides a straightforward approach to the analysis of spherical means, allowing us to determine their power series expansions, construct series solutions to the corresponding inversion problems, derive the partial differential equations they satisfy, and give meaning to iterated and fractional spherical means. Finally, we apply the spherical mean operator to derive the inversion formula for the X-ray transform in an operational manner.</description>
