      <title>Addition in Dumont-Thomas Numeration Systems in Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a fixpoint of a substitution, the associated Dumont-Thomas numeration system provides a convenient immediate way to describe the fixpoint as an automatic sequence. In order to study first-order properties of these fixpoints using B\"uchi-Bruy\`ere characterization, it is necessary for the numeration system to be addable. This means that its addition relation must be computable by a finite automaton. Dumont-Thomas numeration systems can be regarded as an extension of positional numeration systems with states where the greediness is state-dependent. We introduce sequence automata as a tool to extend the results of Bruy\`ere-Hansel and Frougny-Solomyak on the regularity of the addition of Bertrand numeration systems to the case of Dumont-Thomas numeration systems related to some Pisot number. We present a practical implementation of the addition compatible with the Walnut computation tool, along with some experimental results.</description>

      <title>Traversing combinatorial 0/1-polytopes via optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new framework that exploits combinatorial optimization for efficiently generating a large variety of combinatorial objects based on graphs, matroids, posets and polytopes. Our method relies on a simple and versatile algorithm for computing a Hamilton path on the skeleton of any 0/1-polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$, where $X\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$. The algorithm uses as a black box any algorithm that solves a variant of the classical linear optimization problem $\min\{w\cdot x\mid x\in X\}$, and the resulting delay, i.e., the running time per visited vertex on the Hamilton path, is only by a factor of $\log n$ larger than the running time of the optimization algorithm. When $X$ encodes a particular class of combinatorial objects, then traversing the skeleton of the polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$ along a Hamilton path corresponds to listing the combinatorial objects by local change operations, i.e., we obtain Gray code listings. As concrete results of our general framework, we obtain efficient algorithms for generating all ($c$-optimal) bases in a matroid; ($c$-optimal) spanning trees, forests, ($c$-optimal) matchings in a general graph; ($c$-optimal) vertex covers, ($c$-optimal) stable sets in a bipartite graph; as well as ($c$-optimal) antichains and ideals of a poset. The delay and space required by these algorithms are polynomial in the size of the matroid, graph, or poset, respectively, and these listings correspond to Hamilton paths on the corresponding combinatorial polytopes. We also obtain an $O(t_{\rm LP} \log n)$ delay algorithm for the vertex enumeration problem on 0/1-polytopes $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\mid Ax\leq b\}$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}^m$, and $t_{\rm LP}$ is the time needed to solve the linear program $\min\{w\cdot x\mid Ax\leq b\}$. This improves upon the 25-year old $O(t_{\rm LP}\,n)$ delay algorithm of Bussieck and L\"ubbecke.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial generation via permutation languages. VI. Binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a notion of pattern avoidance in binary trees that generalizes the avoidance of contiguous tree patterns studied by Rowland and non-contiguous tree patterns studied by Dairyko, Pudwell, Tyner, and Wynn. Specifically, we propose algorithms for generating different classes of binary trees that are characterized by avoiding one or more of these generalized patterns. This is achieved by applying the recent Hartung-Hoang-M\"utze-Williams generation framework, by encoding binary trees via permutations. In particular, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between tree patterns and certain mesh permutation patterns. We also conduct a systematic investigation of all tree patterns on at most 5 vertices, and we establish bijections between pattern-avoiding binary trees and other combinatorial objects, in particular pattern-avoiding lattice paths and set partitions.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

      <title>Edge coloring of products of signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2020, Behr defined the problem of edge coloring of signed graphs and showed that every signed graph $(G, \sigma)$ can be colored using exactly $\Delta(G)$ or $\Delta(G) + 1$ colors, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree in graph $G$.
  In this paper, we focus on products of signed graphs. We recall the definitions of the Cartesian, tensor, strong, and corona products of signed graphs and prove results for them. In particular, we show that $(1)$ the Cartesian product of $\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graphs is $\Delta$-edge-colorable, $(2)$ the tensor product of a $\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graph and a signed tree requires only $\Delta$ colors and $(3)$ the corona product of almost any two signed graphs is $\Delta$-edge-colorable. We also prove some results related to the coloring of products of signed paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>Future Directions in the Theory of Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02287v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks (GNNs), has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.</description>
