      <title>WAXAL: A Large-Scale Multilingual African Language Speech Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of speech technology has predominantly favored high-resource languages, creating a significant digital divide for speakers of most Sub-Saharan African languages. To address this gap, we introduce WAXAL, a large-scale, openly accessible speech dataset for 21 languages representing over 100 million speakers. The collection consists of two main components: an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset containing approximately 1,250 hours of transcribed, natural speech from a diverse range of speakers, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) dataset with over 180 hours of high-quality, single-speaker recordings reading phonetically balanced scripts. This paper details our methodology for data collection, annotation, and quality control, which involved partnerships with four African academic and community organizations. We provide a detailed statistical overview of the dataset and discuss its potential limitations and ethical considerations. The WAXAL datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/WaxalNLP under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license to catalyze research, enable the development of inclusive technologies, and serve as a vital resource for the digital preservation of these languages.</description>

      <title>WST-X Series: Wavelet Scattering Transform for Interpretable Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing front-ends for speech deepfake detectors primarily focuses on two categories. Hand-crafted filterbank features are transparent but are limited in capturing high-level semantic details, often resulting in performance gaps compared to self-supervised (SSL) features. SSL features, in turn, lack interpretability and may overlook fine-grained spectral anomalies. We propose the WST-X series, a novel family of feature extractors that combines the best of both worlds via the wavelet scattering transform (WST), integrating wavelets with nonlinearities analogous to deep convolutional networks. We investigate 1D and 2D WSTs to extract acoustic details and higher-order structural anomalies, respectively. Experimental results on the recent and challenging Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset indicate that WST-X outperforms existing front-ends by a wide margin. Our analysis reveals that a small averaging scale ($J$), combined with high-frequency and directional resolutions ($Q, L$), is critical for capturing subtle artifacts. This underscores the value of translation-invariant and deformation-stable features for robust and interpretable speech deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Mi\'{c}i Princ -- A Little Boy Teaching Speech Technologies the Chakavian Dialect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper documents our efforts in releasing the printed and audio book of the translation of the famous novel The Little Prince into the Chakavian dialect, as a computer-readable, AI-ready dataset, with the textual and the audio components of the two releases now aligned on the level of each written and spoken word. Our motivation for working on this release is multiple. The first one is our wish to preserve the highly valuable and specific content beyond the small editions of the printed and the audio book. With the dataset published in the CLARIN.SI repository, this content is from now on at the fingertips of any interested individual. The second motivation is to make the data available for various artificial-intelligence-related usage scenarios, such as the one we follow upon inside this paper already -- adapting the Whisper-large-v3 open automatic speech recognition model, with decent performance on standard Croatian, to Chakavian dialectal speech. We can happily report that with adapting the model, the word error rate on the selected test data has being reduced to a half, while we managed to remove up to two thirds of the error on character level. We envision many more usages of this dataset beyond the set of experiments we have already performed, both on tasks of artificial intelligence research and application, as well as dialectal research. The third motivation for this release is our hope that this, now highly structured dataset, will be transformed into a digital online edition of this work, allowing individuals beyond the research and technology communities to enjoy the beauty of the message of the little boy in the desert, told through the spectacular prism of the Chakavian dialect.</description>

      <title>A Unified SVD-Modal Solution for Sparse Sound Field Reconstruction with Hybrid Spherical-Linear Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven sparse recovery framework for hybrid spherical linear microphone arrays using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the transfer operator. The SVD yields orthogonal microphone and field modes, reducing to spherical harmonics (SH) in the SMA-only case, while incorporating LMAs introduces complementary modes beyond SH. Modal analysis reveals consistent divergence from SH across frequency, confirming the improved spatial selectivity. Experiments in reverberant conditions show reduced energy-map mismatch and angular error across frequency, distance, and source count, outperforming SMA-only and direct concatenation. The results demonstrate that SVD-modal processing provides a principled and unified treatment of hybrid arrays for robust sparse sound-field reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Conditional Flow Matching for Visually-Guided Acoustic Highlighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Automated Dysphagia Screening Using Noninvasive Neck Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pharyngeal health plays a vital role in essential human functions such as breathing, swallowing, and vocalization. Early detection of swallowing abnormalities, also known as dysphagia, is crucial for timely intervention. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures. In this study, we propose an automated framework for detecting dysphagia using portable and noninvasive acoustic sensing coupled with applied machine learning. By capturing subtle acoustic signals from the neck during swallowing tasks, we aim to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions. Our approach achieves promising test-time abnormality detection performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using noninvasive acoustic sensing as a practical and scalable tool for pharyngeal health monitoring.</description>

      <title>CodecSlime: Temporal Redundancy Compression of Neural Speech Codec via Dynamic Frame Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have been widely used in audio compression and various downstream tasks. Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which allocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However, speech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result, many tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences. To address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for compressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on neural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and architecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and Melt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When integrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR ($\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to 32% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and similar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also enables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a single model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently outperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates. Audio samples are available at https://acadarmeria.github.io/codecslime/.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Piano Dynamics and Metrical Structure with a Multi-task Multi-Scale Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating piano dynamic from audio recordings is a fundamental challenge in computational music analysis. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-task network that jointly predicts dynamic levels, change points, beats, and downbeats from a shared latent representation. These four targets form the metrical structure of dynamics in the music score. Inspired by recent vocal dynamic research, we use a multi-scale network as the backbone, which takes Bark-scale specific loudness as the input feature. Compared to log-Mel as input, this reduces model size from 14.7 M to 0.5 M, enabling long sequential input. We use a 60-second audio length in audio segmentation, which doubled the length of beat tracking commonly used. Evaluated on the public MazurkaBL dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across all tasks. This work sets a new benchmark for piano dynamic estimation and delivers a powerful and compact tool, paving the way for large-scale, resource-efficient analysis of musical expression.</description>

      <title>DiffRhythm 2: Efficient and High Fidelity Song Generation via Block Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating full-length, high-quality songs is challenging, as it requires maintaining long-term coherence both across text and music modalities and within the music modality itself. Existing non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, while capable of producing high-quality songs, often struggle with the alignment between lyrics and vocal. Concurrently, catering to diverse musical preferences necessitates reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing methods often rely on merging multiple models during multi-preference optimization, which results in significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffRhythm 2, an end-to-end framework designed for high-fidelity, controllable song generation. To tackle the lyric alignment problem, DiffRhythm 2 employs a semi-autoregressive architecture based on block flow matching. This design enables faithful alignment of lyrics to singing vocals without relying on external labels and constraints, all while preserving the high generation quality and efficiency of NAR models. To make this framework computationally tractable for long sequences, we implement a music variational autoencoder (VAE) that achieves a low frame rate of 5 Hz while still enabling high-fidelity audio reconstruction. In addition, to overcome the limitations of multi-preference optimization in RLHF, we propose cross-pair preference optimization. This method effectively mitigates the performance drop typically associated with model merging, allowing for more robust optimization across diverse human preferences. We further enhance musicality and structural coherence by introducing stochastic block representation alignment loss.</description>

      <title>SPEAR: A Unified SSL Framework for Learning Speech and Audio Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has significantly advanced acoustic representation learning. However, most existing models are optimised for either speech or audio event understanding, resulting in a persistent gap between these two domains. We address this gap with SPEAR (SPEech and Audio Representations), a self-supervised framework that distils complementary knowledge from a speech-focused SSL teacher and a general-audio SSL teacher into a single unified model. SPEAR applies multi-codebook vector quantisation to continuous teacher representations to produce fine-grained discrete tokens that capture both semantic and acoustic information. To effectively integrate these heterogeneous representations, SPEAR jointly predicts them given a masked input with an asymmetric pre-training loss. We further improve robustness in complex sound scenes through a novel token mixing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPEAR consistently outperforms existing unified speech and audio models. SPEAR establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SUPERB benchmark, surpassing WavLM Large on 12 of 15 tasks, while achieving competitive performance on the HEAR benchmark. These results position SPEAR as a versatile foundation for general-purpose speech and audio representation learning. The code and pre-trained models will be released.</description>

      <title>RIR-Former: Coordinate-Guided Transformer for Continuous Reconstruction of Room Impulse Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Room impulse responses (RIRs) are essential for many acoustic signal processing tasks, yet measuring them densely across space is often impractical. In this work, we propose RIR-Former, a grid-free, one-step feed-forward model for RIR reconstruction. By introducing a sinusoidal encoding module into a transformer backbone, our method effectively incorporates microphone position information, enabling interpolation at arbitrary array locations. Furthermore, a segmented multi-branch decoder is designed to separately handle early reflections and late reverberation, improving reconstruction across the entire RIR. Experiments on diverse simulated acoustic environments demonstrate that RIR-Former consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and cosine distance (CD), under varying missing rates and array configurations. These results highlight the potential of our approach for practical deployment and motivate future work on scaling from randomly spaced linear arrays to complex array geometries, dynamic acoustic scenes, and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>AlignAtt: Using Attention-based Audio-Translation Alignments as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention is the core mechanism of today's most used architectures for natural language processing and has been analyzed from many perspectives, including its effectiveness for machine translation-related tasks. Among these studies, attention resulted to be a useful source of information to get insights about word alignment also when the input text is substituted with audio segments, as in the case of the speech translation (ST) task. In this paper, we propose AlignAtt, a novel policy for simultaneous ST (SimulST) that exploits the attention information to generate source-target alignments that guide the model during inference. Through experiments on the 8 language pairs of MuST-C v1.0, we show that AlignAtt outperforms previous state-of-the-art SimulST policies applied to offline-trained models with gains in terms of BLEU of 2 points and latency reductions ranging from 0.5s to 0.8s across the 8 languages.</description>

      <title>AudioJailbreak: Jailbreak Attacks against End-to-End Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied recently, but they exclusively focused on the attack scenario where the adversary can fully manipulate user prompts (named strong adversary) and limited in effectiveness, applicability, and practicability. In this work, we first conduct an extensive evaluation showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to-speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AUDIOJAILBREAK, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audios do not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into the perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios is concealed by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating reverberation into the perturbation generation. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, and/or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AUDIOJAILBREAK is also applicable to a more practical and broader attack scenario where the adversary cannot fully manipulate user prompts (named weak adversary). Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AUDIOJAILBREAK, in particular, it can jailbreak openAI's GPT-4o-Audio and bypass Meta's Llama-Guard-3 safeguard, in the weak adversary scenario. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their robustness, especially for the newly proposed weak adversary.</description>

      <title>Evaluating High-Resolution Piano Sustain Pedal Depth Estimation with Musically Informed Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03750</link>

Abstract: Evaluation for continuous piano pedal depth estimation tasks remains incomplete when relying only on conventional frame-level metrics, which overlook musically important features such as direction-change boundaries and pedal curve contours. To provide more interpretable and musically meaningful insights, we propose an evaluation framework that augments standard frame-level metrics with an action-level assessment measuring direction and timing using segments of press/hold/release states and a gesture-level analysis that evaluates contour similarity of each press-release cycle. We apply this framework to compare an audio-only baseline with two variants: one incorporating symbolic information from MIDI, and another trained in a binary-valued setting, all within a unified architecture. Results show that the MIDI-informed model significantly outperforms the others at action and gesture levels, despite modest frame-level gains. These findings demonstrate that our framework captures musically relevant improvements indiscernible by traditional metrics, offering a more practical and effective approach to evaluating pedal depth estimation models.</description>

      <title>Modeling Sarcastic Speech: Semantic and Prosodic Cues in a Speech Synthesis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07096</link>

Abstract: Sarcasm is a pragmatic phenomenon in which speakers convey meanings that diverge from literal content, relying on an interaction between semantics and prosodic expression. However, how these cues jointly contribute to the recognition of sarcasm remains poorly understood. We propose a computational framework that models sarcasm as the integration of semantic interpretation and prosodic realization. Semantic cues are derived from an LLaMA 3 model fine-tuned to capture discourse-level markers of sarcastic intent, while prosodic cues are extracted through semantically aligned utterances drawn from a database of sarcastic speech, providing prosodic exemplars of sarcastic delivery. Using a speech synthesis testbed, perceptual evaluations demonstrate that both semantic and prosodic cues independently enhance listeners' perception of sarcasm, with the strongest effects emerging when the two are combined. These findings highlight the complementary roles of semantics and prosody in pragmatic interpretation and illustrate how modeling can shed light on the mechanisms underlying sarcastic communication.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Speech Synthesizers Can Learn from Multiple Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) is inherently a "one-to-many" mapping characterized by intrinsic uncertainty, yet current paradigms often oversimplify it into a deterministic regression task. While continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to discrete codec-based approaches, they typically rely on a fixed-variance prior, fundamentally constraining generation to a static point estimate that ignores the dynamic variability of natural speech. To bridge this gap, we propose BELLE (Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling), a framework that shifts from deterministic prediction to principled Bayesian inference without increasing model parameters or inference latency. By modeling the acoustic target as a Normal-Inverse-Gamma distribution, BELLE captures data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. To enable accurate variance estimation on standard single-reference datasets, we introduce a "one-to-many" training strategy that leverages synthetic samples as a statistical support set, allowing the model to learn robust distributional properties rather than merely imitating teacher artifacts. Experiments demonstrate that BELLE, trained on only ~5k hours of data, outperforms leading open-source models trained on 50k hours (achieving a 25.8% relative WER reduction) and naturally supports high-quality streaming generation.

      <title>Do Models Hear Like Us? Probing the Representational Alignment of Audio LLMs and Naturalistic EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16540</link>

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in integrating speech perception with language understanding. However, whether their internal representations align with human neural dynamics during naturalistic listening remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically examine layer-wise representational alignment between 12 open-source Audio LLMs and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across 2 datasets. Specifically, we employ 8 similarity metrics, such as Spearman-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), to characterize within-sentence representational geometry. Our analysis reveals 3 key findings: (1) we observe a rank-dependence split, in which model rankings vary substantially across different similarity metrics; (2) we identify spatio-temporal alignment patterns characterized by depth-dependent alignment peaks and a pronounced increase in RSA within the 250-500 ms time window, consistent with N400-related neural dynamics; (3) we find an affective dissociation whereby negative prosody, identified using a proposed Tri-modal Neighborhood Consistency (TNC) criterion, reduces geometric similarity while enhancing covariance-based dependence. These findings provide new neurobiological insights into the representational mechanisms of Audio LLMs.</description>
