      <title>Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.</description>

      <title>Latent splitting as a causal probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizations of Bell's framework to causal networks have yielded new foundational insights and applications, including the use of interventions to enhance the detection of nonclassicality in scenarios with communication. Such interventions, however, become uninformative when all observable variables are space-like separated. To address this limitation, we introduce the latent splitting procedure, a generalization of interventions to quantum networks in which controlled manipulations are applied to latent quantum systems. We show that latent splitting enables the detection of nonclassicality by combining observational and interventional data even when conventional interventions fail. Focusing on the triangle network, we derive new analytical witnesses that robustly certify nonclassicality, including nonlinear inequalities for minimal binary-variable scenarios and extensions of the nonclassical region of previously proposed experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for dephasing of coupled systems: decoupling and IQP duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically. We comment on the computational complexity of this class of dissipative problems, using the known fact that sampling from IQP circuits is believed to be difficult classically.</description>

      <title>The pros and cons of using deep reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms to design control schemes for quantum state transfer on qubit chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, control methods based on different optimization techniques have shed light on the possibilities of processing information in many quantum systems. When exploring the transmission of quantum states, faster transmission times are mandatory to avoid the deleterious effects of multiple sources of decoherence that spoil the transmission process. In particular, using Reinforcement Learning to devise sequences of step-wise external controls provides good transfer policies at short transmission times. We present two approaches to control the transmission of quantum states in qubit chains using external controls to force the dynamical evolution of the chain state. The first approach relies on the well-known Genetic Algorithm to generate a sequence of external controls, while the second approach uses a variant of Reinforcement Learning. The Genetic algorithm achieves excellent transmission fidelity at as short transmission times as Reinforcement Learning, surpassing the fidelities achieved by the latter method. Nevertheless, the Reinforcement Learning method offers robust control policies when the control pulses are noisy enough, owing to an imperfect timing of the pulses, deficient control devices, or other sources of phase decoherence. We present the regime where each method is best suited to control the transmission of arbitrary qubit states.</description>

      <title>Looking for Work in Quantum Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper diagnoses a much-discussed problem in quantum thermodynamics, that of generalizing classical work into the quantum domain. I begin with the no-go theorem of Perarnau-Llobet et al (2017): no universal measurement scheme for quantum work satisfies two intuitive, classically consilient desiderata. I assess this incompatibility as stemming from the measurement problem. Decoherence restores compatibility for all practical purposes, but raises questions about what 'universality' should mean and whether any measurement scheme can be 'universal'. I consider a different standard of universality -- in terms of ontology -- by defining a trajectory-based notion of quantum work using the quantum potential. While this preserves the classical role of work as the integral of forces over distances, and evades the tension of the no-go theorem, consilience fails elsewhere; no single quantum work concept seems capable of preserving all classical features, raising questions for what it takes for successful generalization of the work concept to quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Bipartitioning of Graph States for Distributed Measurement-Based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) is inherently well-suited for Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC): once a resource state is prepared and distributed across a network of quantum nodes, computation proceeds through local measurements coordinated by classical communication. However, since non-local gates acting on different Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are a bottleneck, it is crucial to optimize the qubit assignment to minimize inter-node entanglement of the shared resource. For graph state resources shared across two QPUs, this task reduces to finding bipartitions with minimal cut rank. We introduce a simulated annealing-based algorithm that efficiently updates the cut rank when two vertices swap sides across a bipartition, such that computing the new cut rank from scratch, which would be much more expensive, is not necessary. We show that the approach is highly effective for determining qubit assignments in distributed MBQC by testing it on grid graphs and the measurement-based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).</description>

      <title>A Linear Combination of Unitaries Decomposition for the Laplace Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide novel linear combination of unitaries decompositions for a class of discrete elliptic differential operators. Specifically, Poisson problems augmented with periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and mixed boundary conditions are considered on the unit interval and on higher-dimensional rectangular domains. The number of unitary terms required for our decomposition is independent of the number of grid points used in the discretization and scales linearly with the spatial dimension. Explicit circuit constructions for each unitary are given and their complexities analyzed. The worst case depth and elementary gate cost of any such circuit is shown to scale at most logarithmically with respect to number of grid points in the underlying discrete system. We also investigate the cost of using our method within the Variational Quantum Linear Solver algorithm and show favorable scaling. Finally, we extend the proposed decomposition technique to treat problems that include first-order derivative terms with variable coefficients.</description>

      <title>Continual Quantum Architecture Search with Tensor-Train Encoding: Theory and Applications to Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CL-QAS, a continual quantum architecture search framework that mitigates the challenges of costly amplitude encoding and catastrophic forgetting in variational quantum circuits. The method uses Tensor-Train encoding to efficiently compress high-dimensional stochastic signals into low-rank quantum feature representations. A bi-loop learning strategy separates circuit parameter optimization from architecture exploration, while an Elastic Weight Consolidation regularization ensures stability across sequential tasks. We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Informationally Complete Distributed Metrology Without a Shared Reference Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information processing, implementing arbitrary preparations and measurements on qubits necessitates precise information to identify a specific reference frame (RF). In space quantum communication and sensing, where a shared RF is absent, the interplay between locality and symmetry imposes fundamental restrictions on physical systems. A restriction on realizable unitary operations results in a no-go theorem prohibiting the extraction of locally encoded information in RF-independent distributed metrology. Here, we propose a reversed-encoding method applied to two copies of local-unitary-invariant network states. This approach circumvents the no-go theorem while simultaneously mitigating decoherence-like noise caused by RF misalignment, thereby enabling the complete recovery of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Furthermore, we confirm local Bell-state measurements as an optimal strategy to saturate the QFI. Our findings pave the way for the field application of distributed quantum sensing, which is inherently subject to unknown RF misalignment and was previously precluded by the no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>Even Odd Splitting of the Gaussian Quantum Fisher Information: From Symplectic Geometry to Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a canonical decomposition of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for centered multimode Gaussian states into two additive pieces: an even part that captures changes in the symplectic spectrum and an odd part associated with correlation-generating dynamics. On the pure-state manifold, the even contribution vanishes identically, while the odd contribution coincides with the QFI derived from the natural metric on the Siegel upper half-space, revealing a direct geometric underpinning of pure-Gaussian metrology. This also provides a link between the graphical representation of pure Gaussian states and an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of graphical parameters. For evolutions completely generated by passive Gaussian unitaries (orthogonal symplectics), the odd QFI vanishes, while thermometric parameters contribute purely to the even sector with a simple spectral form; we also derive a state-dependent lower bound on the even QFI in terms of the purity-change rate. We extend the construction to the full QFI matrix, obtaining an additive even odd sector decomposition that clarifies when cross-parameter information vanishes. Applications to unitary sensing (beam splitter versus two-mode squeezing) and to Gaussian channels (loss and phase-insensitive amplification), including joint phase loss estimation, demonstrate how the decomposition cleanly separates resources associated with spectrum versus correlations. The framework supplies practical design rules for continuous-variable sensors and provides a geometric lens for benchmarking probes and channels in Gaussian quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Restoring Locality: The Heisenberg Picture as a Separable Description of Quantum Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local realism has been the subject of much discussion in modern physics, partly because our deepest theories of physics appear to contradict one another in regard to whether reality is local. According to general relativity, it is, as physical quantities (perceptible or not) in two spacelike separated regions cannot affect one another. Yet, in quantum theory, it has traditionally been thought that local realism cannot hold and that such effects do occur. This apparent discrepancy between the two theories is resolved by Everettian quantum theory, as first proven by Deutsch &amp; Hayden (2000). In this paper, I will explain how local realism is respected in quantum theory and review the advances in our understanding of locality since Deutsch &amp; Hayden's work, including the concept of local branching and the more general analysis by Raymond-Robichaud (2021)</description>

      <title>Digital Predistortion of Power Amplifiers for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power amplifiers (PA) are essential for microwavecontrolled trapped-ion and semiconductor spin based quantum computers (QC). They adjust the power level of the control signal and therefore the processing time of the QC. Their nonlinearities and memory effects degrade the signal quality and, thus, the fidelity of qubit gate operations. Driving the PA with a significant input power back-off reduces nonlinear effects but is neither power-efficient nor cost-effective. To overcome this limitation, this letter augments the conventional signal generation system applied in QCs by digital predistortion (DPD) to linearize the radio frequency (RF) channel. Numerical analysis of the qubit behavior based on measured representative control signals indicates that DPD improves its fidelity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation and spatial superposition of a nanodiamond with a current-carrying chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a current-carrying-chip scheme for generating spatial quantum superpositions using a levitating nanodiamond with a built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre defect. Our setup is quite versatile and we aim to create the superposition for a mass range of $10^{-19}~{\rm kg}&lt; m&lt; 10^{-15}~{\rm kg}$ and a superposition size ${\cal O}(10) {\rm \mu m} &lt; \Delta x &lt; {\cal O}(1){\rm nm}$, respectively, in $t\leq 0.1$s, depending on the position we launch from the center of the diamagnetic trap. We provide an in-depth analysis of two parallel chips that can create levitation and spatial superposition along the $x$-axis, while producing a very tight trap in the $y$ direction, and the direction of gravity, i.e., the $z$ direction. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our setup can create a one-dimensional spatial superposition state along the x-axis. Throughout this process, the particle is stably levitated in the z-direction, and its motion is effectively confined in the y-direction for a Gaussian initial condition. This setup presents a viable platform for a diamagnetically levitated nanoparticle for a table-top experiment exploring the possibility of creating a macroscopic Schr\"odinger Cat state to test the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol.</description>

      <title>Rydberg atom parity gate based on dark state resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation (QC) and digital quantum simulation (DQS) essentially require two- or multi-qubit controlled-NOT or -phase gates. We propose an alternative pathway for QC and DQS using a three-qubit parity gate in a Rydberg atom array. The basic principle of the Rydberg atom parity gate (RPG) is that the operation on the target qubit is controlled by the parity of the control qubits. First, we discuss how to construct an RPG based on a dark state resonance. We optimize the gate parameters by numerically analyzing the time evolution of the computational basis states to maximize the gate fidelity. We also show that our proposed RPG is extremely robust against the Rydberg blockade error. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed RPG over the conventional CNOT or CZ gate in QC and DQS, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and simulate the Ising Hamiltonian. The results show that RPG can be a better substitute of the CNOT gate to yield better results, as it decreases the circuit noise by reducing circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian qLDPC: TQFT Formalism, Addressable Gauging Measurement and Application to Magic State Fountain on 2D Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincar\'e CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits.</description>

      <title>A paradigm for universal quantum information processing with integrated acousto-optic frequency beamsplitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-bin encoding offers tremendous potential in quantum photonic information processing, in which a single waveguide can support hundreds of lightpaths in a naturally phase-stable fashion. This stability, however, comes at a cost: arbitrary unitary operations can be realized by cascaded electro-optic phase modulators and pulse shapers, but require nontrivial numerical optimization for design and have thus far been limited to discrete tabletop components. In this article, we propose, formalize, and computationally evaluate a new paradigm for universal frequency-bin quantum information processing using acousto-optic scattering processes between distinct transverse modes. We show that controllable phase matching in intermodal processes enables 2$\times$2 frequency beamsplitters and transverse-mode-dependent phase shifters, which together comprise cascadable FRequency-transverse-mODe Operations (FRODOs) that can synthesize any unitary via analytical decomposition procedures. Modeling the performance of both random gates and discrete Fourier transforms, we demonstrate the feasibility of high-fidelity quantum operations with existing integrated photonics technology, highlighting prospects of parallelizable operations achieving 100\% bandwidth utilization. Our approach is realizable with CMOS technology, opening the door to scalable on-chip quantum information processing in the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Noise-Resistant Feature-Aware Attack Detection Using Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) is a quantum communication technology that offers an unconditional security guarantee. However, the practical deployment of CV-QKD systems remains vulnerable to various quantum attacks. In this paper, we propose a quantum machine learning (QML)-based attack detection framework (QML-ADF) that safeguards the security of high-rate CV-QKD systems. In particular, two alternative QML models -- quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN) -- are developed to perform noise-resistant and feature-aware attack detection before conventional data postprocessing. Leveraging feature-rich quantum data from Gaussian modulation and homodyne detection, the QML-ADF effectively detects quantum attacks, including both known and unknown types defined by these distinctive features. The results indicate that all twelve distinct QML variants for both QSVM and QNN exhibit remarkable performance in detecting both known and previously undiscovered quantum attacks, with the best-performing QSVM variant outperforming the top QNN counterpart. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate the performance of the QML-ADF under various physically interpretable noise backends, demonstrating its strong robustness and superior detection performance. We anticipate that the QML-ADF will not only enable robust detection of quantum attacks under realistic deployment conditions but also strengthen the practical security of quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum science with arrays of metastable helium-3 atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of atoms in programmable optical tweezer arrays offers many new opportunities for neutral atom quantum science. These include inter- and intra-site atom motion for resource-efficient implementations of fermionic and bosonic modes, respectively, as well as tweezer transport for efficient compilation of arbitrary circuits. However, the exploitation of atomic motion for all three purposes and others is limited by the inertia of the atoms. We present a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the use of fermionic metastable helium-3 ($^3$He$^*$) atoms -- the lightest trappable atomic species -- in programmable optical tweezer arrays. This includes a concrete analysis of atomic structure considerations as well as Rydberg-mediated interactions. We show that inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atoms can be $\gtrsim3\times$ faster than previous demonstrations with lithium-6. We also demonstrate a new toolbox for encoding and manipulating qubits directly in the tweezer trap potential, uniquely enabled by the light mass of $^3$He$^*$. Finally, we provide several examples of new opportunities for fermionic quantum simulation and computation that leverage the transport and inter-tweezer hopping of $^3$He$^*$ atom arrays. These tools present new methods to improve the resource efficiency of neutral atom quantum science that may also enable quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories and quantum chemistry outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation</description>

      <title>Experimental Coherent One-Way Quantum Key Distribution with Simplicity and Practical Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) has been widely investigated, and even been deployed in real-world quantum network. However, the proposal of the zero-error attack has critically undermined its security guarantees, and existing experimental implementations have not yet established security against coherent attacks. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an information-theoretically secure COW-QKD protocol that can resist source side-channel attacks, with secure transmission distances up to 100 km. Our system achieves a secure key rate on the order of kilobits per second over 50 km in the finite-size regime, sufficient for real-time secure voice communication across metropolitan networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the encrypted transmission of a logo with information-theoretic security over 100 km of optical fiber. These results confirm that COW-QKD can simultaneously provide simplicity and security, establishing it as a strong candidate for deployment in small-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Operational Characterization of Two-Qutrit Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of bipartite two-qutrit pure states from both geometric and operational perspectives.Using the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, we analyze how symmetric polynomials characterize pairwise and genuinely three-level correlations. We show that the determinant of the coefficient matrix defines a natural, rank-sensitive geometric invariant that vanishes for all rank-2 states and is nonzero only for rank-3 entangled states. An explicit analytic constraint relating this determinant-based invariant to the I-concurrence is derived, thereby defining the physically accessible region of two-qutrit states in invariant space. Furthermore, we establish an operational correspondence with three-path optical interferometry and analyze conditional visibility and predictability in a qutrit quantum erasure protocol, including the effects of unequal path transmittances. Numerical demonstrations confirm the analytic results and the associated complementarity relations. These findings provide a unified geometric and operational framework for understanding two-qutrit entanglement.</description>

      <title>Cancelling second order frequency shifts in Ge hole spin qubits via bichromatic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium quantum dot hole spin qubits are compatible with fully electrical control and are progressing toward multi-qubit operations. However, their coherence is limited by charge noise and driving field induced frequency shifts, and the resulting ensemble $1/f$ dephasing. Here we theoretically demonstrate that a bichromatic driving scheme cancels the second order frequency shift from the control field without sacrificing the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) rate, and without additional gate design or microwave engineering. Based on this property, we further demonstrate that bichromatic control creates a wide operating window that reduces sensitivity to quasi-static charge noise and thus enhances single qubit gate fidelity. This method provides a low-power route to a stabler frequency operation in germanium hole spin qubits and is readily transferable to other semiconductor spin qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Axion Signal Search Using Hybrid Nuclear-Electronic Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional nuclear magnetic resonance searches for the galactic axion wind lose sensitivity at low frequencies due to the unfavourable scaling of inductive readout. Here, we propose a hybrid architecture where the hyperfine interaction transduces axion-driven nuclear precession into a high-bandwidth electron-spin readout channel. We demonstrate analytically that this dispersive upconversion preserves the specific sidereal and annual modulation signatures required to distinguish dark matter signals from instrumental backgrounds. When instantiated in a silicon ${ }^{209} \text{Bi}$ donor platform, the hybrid sensor is projected to outperform direct nuclear detection by more than an order of magnitude over the $10^{-16}-10^{-6} \text{eV}$ wide mass range. With collective enhancement, the design reaches a $5 \sigma$ sensitivity to DFSZ axion-nucleon couplings within one year, establishing hyperfine-mediated sensing as a competitive path for compact, solid-state dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit-Based Adaptation for Credit Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy and Intermediate-Scale Quantum, or NISQ, processors are sensitive to noise, prone to quantum decoherence, and are not yet capable of continuous quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hence, quantum algorithms designed in the pre-fault-tolerant era cannot neglect the noisy nature of the hardware, and investigating the relationship between quantum hardware performance and the output of quantum algorithms is essential. In this work, we experimentally study how hardware-aware variational quantum circuits on a superconducting quantum processing unit can model distributions relevant to specific use-case applications for Credit Risk Analysis, e.g., standard Gaussian distributions for latent factor loading in the Gaussian Conditional Independence model. We use a transpilation technique tailored to the specific quantum hardware topology, which minimizes gate depth and connectivity violations, and we calibrate the gate rotations of the circuit to achieve an optimized output from quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate the viability of quantum adaptation on a small-scale, proof-of-concept model inspired by financial applications and offer a good starting point for understanding the practical use of NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>High capacity dual degrees of freedom quantum secret sharing protocol beyond the linear rate-distance bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is the multipartite cryptographic primitive. Most of existing QSS protocols are limited by the linear rate-distance bound, and cannot realize the long-distance and high-capacity multipartite key distribution. This paper proposes a polarization (Pol) and phase (Ph) dual degrees of freedom (dual-DOF) QSS protocol based on the weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources. Our protocol combines the single-photon interference, two-photon interference and non-interference principles, and can resist the internal attack from the dishonest player. We develop simulation method to estimate its performance under the beam splitting attack. The simulation results show that our protocol can surpass the linear bound. Comparing with the differential-phase-shift twin-field QSS and WCP-Ph-QSS protocols, our protocol has stronger resistance against the beam splitting attack, and thus has longer maximal communication distance and higher key rate. By using the WCPs with high average photon number ($\mu$ = 1.5), our protocol achieves a key rate about 5.4 times of that in WCP-Ph-QSS protocol. Its maximal communication distance (441.7 km) is about 7.9% longer than that of the WCP-Ph-QSS. Our protocol is highly feasible with current experimental technology and offers a promising approach for long-distance and high-capacity quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Extending the Handover-Iterative VQE to Challenging Strongly Correlated Systems: $N_2$ and Fe-S Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately describing strongly correlated electronic systems remains a central challenge in quantum chemistry, as electron-electron interactions give rise to complex many-body wavefunctions that are difficult to capture with conventional approximations. Classical wavefunction-based approaches, such as the Semistochastic Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI) and the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), currently define the state of the art, systematically converging toward the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit, but at a rapidly increasing computational cost. Quantum computing algorithms promise to alleviate this scaling bottleneck by leveraging entanglement and superposition to represent correlated states more compactly. We introduced the Handover-Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HI-VQE) as a practical quantum computing algorithm with an iterative "handover" mechanism that dynamically exchanges information between quantum and classical computers, even using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. In this work, we extend the HI-VQE to benchmark two prototypical strongly correlated systems, the nitrogen molecule $N_2$ and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which serve as stringent tests for both classical and quantum electronic-structure methods. By comparing HI-VQE results against Heat-bath Configuration Interaction (HCI) benchmarks, we assess its accuracy, scalability, and ability to capture multireference correlation effects. Achieving quantitative agreement on these canonical systems demonstrates a viable pathway toward quantum-enhanced simulations of complex bioinorganic molecules, catalytic mechanisms, and correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Correlation of the Post-quench Non-thermal Equilibrium State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a quantum quench, the integrable system is expected to relax to a non-thermal equilibrium state (NTES) whose local properties are believed to be governed by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Combining quench action and the form factor approach, we compute the field-field correlation in the NTES produced by an interaction quench of the Lieb-Liniger model. The spectral distribution is shown to be qualitatively different from that of a thermal equilibrium state (TES): a new dispersion branch appears whose microscopic mechanism can be traced to the algebraic decaying tail for the root density distribution function, and indicates the existence of a broader family of NTES featuring similar spectral property.</description>

      <title>Counter-diabatic driving for fast spin control in a two-electron double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The techniques of shortcuts to adiabaticity have been proposed to accelerate the "slow" adiabatic processes in various quantum systems with the applications in quantum information processing. In this paper, we study the counter-diabatic driving for fast adiabatic spin manipulation in a two-electron double quantum dot by designing time-dependent electric fields in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. To simplify implementation and find an alternative shortcut, we further transform the Hamiltonian in term of Lie algebra, which allows one to use a single Cartesian component of electric fields. In addition, the relation between energy and time is quantified to show the lower bound for the operation time when the maximum amplitude of electric fields is given. Finally, the fidelity is discussed with respect to noise and systematic errors, which demonstrates that the decoherence effect induced by stochastic environment can be avoided in speeded-up adiabatic control.</description>

      <title>Quantum state engineering of spin-orbit coupled ultracold atoms in a Morse potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving full control of a Bose-Einstein condensate can have valuable applications in metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum condensed matter physics. We propose protocols to simultaneously control the internal (related to its pseudospin-1/2) and motional (position-related) states of a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a Morse potential. In the presence of synthetic spin-orbit coupling, the state transition of a noninteracting condensate can be implemented by Raman coupling and detuning terms designed by invariant-based inverse engineering. The state transfer may also be driven by tuning the direction of the spin-orbit-coupling field and modulating the magnitude of the effective synthetic magnetic field. The results can be generalized for interacting condensates by changing the time-dependent detuning to compensate for the interaction. We find that a two-level algorithm for the inverse engineering remains numerically accurate even if the entire set of possible states is considered. The proposed approach is robust against the laser-field noise and systematic device-dependent errors.</description>

      <title>Graphene-assisted resonant transmission and enhanced Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift in a frustrated total internal reflection configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene-assisted resonant transmission and enhanced Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift are investigated in a two-prism frustrated-total-internal-reflection configuration. Due to the excitation of surface plasmons induced by graphene in low terahertz frequency range, there exist the resonant transmission and anomalous Goos-H\"{a}nchen shifts in such optical tunneling configuration. As compared to the case of quantum well, graphene sheet with unique optical properties can enhance the resonant transmission with relatively low loss, and modulate the large negative and positive Goos-H\"{a}nchen shifts by adjusting chemical potential or electron relaxation time. These intriguing phenomena may lead to some potential applications in graphene-based electro-optic devices.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of decorrelating processes: an experimental assessment in cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy production quantifies the amount of irreversibility of a physical process, leading to fundamental bounds for thermodynamic quantities. Particularly in the quantum realm, considerable research has been carried out in the last decades extending entropy production to nonequilibrium processes. We experimentally investigate the entropy production of forward-backward cycles containing different decorrelating processes realized to erase different types of correlations between two interacting systems, from obliterating solely quantum coherence to completely decorrelating local states. We apply these processes to the entanglement of a two-level atom, realized with a circular Rydberg atom, and a light field of a high-quality microwave cavity. The entropy production is computed from the full quantum-state tomography of the system performed at different stages of the interaction-decorrelation sequence. Due to the quantum nature of the atom-cavity system, we find that, although standard, the maximum likelihood estimation method for the density matrix leads to spurious divergences of the entropy production. We propose and implement an alternative estimator that remedies such divergences. Our work experimentally assesses irreversibility of non-thermal processes and addresses the care that must be taken in handling experimental data to estimate the entropy production.</description>

      <title>Subspace Selected Variational Quantum Configuration Interaction with a Partial Walsh Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is one of the most promising applications for quantum algorithms. Here we propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) \emph{Ansatz} for finding ground state configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions. We map CI for fermions to a quantum circuit using a subspace superposition, then apply diagonal Walsh operators to encode the wavefunction. The algorithm can be used to solve both full CI and selected CI wavefunctions, resuling in exact and near-exact solutions for electronic ground states. Both the subspace selection and wavefunction \emph{Ansatz} can be applied to any Hamiltonian that can be written in a qubit basis. The algorithm bypasses costly classical matrix diagonalizations, which is advantageous for large-scale applications. We demonstrate results for several molecules using quantum simulators and hardware.</description>

      <title>Stochastic phase-space simulation of multimode cat states via the positive-P representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the transient dynamics of multimode Schr\"odinger cat states in dissipatively coupled resonator arrays using the positive-P phase-space method. By employing the positive-P representation, we derive the exact stochastic differential equations governing the system's dynamics, enabling the simulation of system sizes significantly larger than those accessible via direct master equation simulation. We demonstrate the utility of this method by simulating transient dynamics for networks up to N=21 sites. Furthermore, we critically examine the method's usefulness and limitations, specifically highlighting the computational instability encountered when estimating the state parity in the systems. Our results provide a pathway for scalable simulations of non-Gaussian states in large open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic theory for subcycle ionic dynamics in multielectron tunneling ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07050v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multielectron tunneling ionization creates ionic coherence crucial for lasing and driving electron motion in molecules. While tunneling is well understood as a single active electron process, less emphasis has been placed on theoretical descriptions of bound electrons during tunneling. This work systematically investigates multielectron tunneling ionization based on the strong field approximation, establishing a theoretical foundation and demonstrating the equivalence of wave function and density matrix approaches for subcycle ionic dynamics. An accurate subcycle nonadiabatic ionization rate is also derived and incorporated into the theory to improve its quantitative accuracy. Applying the theory to N$_{2}$ and CO$_{2}$, this work showcases how an intense laser field can induce ionic coherence in molecules as observed in previous experiments. These findings encourage future investigations into multielectron tunneling ionization and its applications in lasing and in controlling chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Composable Verification in the Circuit-Model via Magic-Blindness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing machines move towards the utility regime, it is essential that users are able to verify their delegated quantum computations with security guarantees that are (i) robust to noise, (ii) composable with other secure protocols, and (iii) exponentially stronger as the number of resources dedicated to security increases. Previous works that achieve these guarantees and provide modularity necessary to optimization of protocols to real-world hardware are most often expressed in the Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) model. This leaves architectures based on the circuit model -- in particular those using the Magic State Injection (MSI) -- with fewer options to verify their computations or with the need to compile their circuits in MBQC leading to overheads.
  This paper introduces a family of noise robust, composable and efficient verification protocols for Clifford + MSI circuits that are secure against arbitrary malicious behavior. This family contains the verification protocol of Broadbent (ToC, 2018), extends its security guarantees while also bridging the modularity gap between MBQC and circuit-based protocols, and reducing quantum communication costs. As a result, it opens the prospect of rapid implementation for near-term quantum devices.
  Our technique is based on a refined notion of blindness, called magic-blindness, which hides only the injected magic states -- the sole source of non-Clifford computational power. This enables verification by randomly interleaving computation rounds with classically simulable, magic-free test rounds, leading to a trap-based framework for verification. As a result, circuit-based quantum verification attains the same level of security and robustness previously known only in MBQC. It also optimizes the quantum communication cost as transmitted qubits are required only at the locations of state injection.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of virtual negative states in the Kapitza-Dirac effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative states are an intrinsic property of relativistic quantum theory and related to anti-particles in the context of the Dirac sea concept. We show that negative states can dominantly contribute to the diffraction amplitude in the quantum dynamics of the two-photon Kapitza-Dirac effect. We draw our conclusion by investigating solutions from time-dependent perturbation theory, where the perturbative solutions are in match with numeric solutions of the relativistic quantum system and also with the numeric and analytic solutions from the relativistic equations of motion of a classical point-like electron in an external standing wave light field. While our numeric solutions assume a strong laser field, the analytic solutions indicate that negative state coupling remains dominant for arbitrary low field amplitudes, where in the single-photon case (Compton scattering) negative state coupling can be mathematically associated with the interaction of a virtual electron-positron pair in the context of a quantized theory in old-fashioned perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Direct temperature readout in nonequilibrium quantum thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry aims to measure temperature in nanoscale quantum systems, paralleling classical thermometry. However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Compatible Dictionary Learning via Doubly Sparse Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dictionary learning (DL) is a core tool in signal processing and machine learning for discovering sparse representations of data. In contrast with classical successes, there is currently no practical quantum dictionary learning algorithm. We argue that this absence stems from structural mismatches between classical DL formulations and the operational constraints of quantum computing. We identify the fundamental bottlenecks that prevent efficient quantum realization of classical DL and show how a structurally restricted model, doubly sparse dictionary learning (DSDL), naturally avoids these problems. We present a simple, hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on projection-based randomized Kaczmarz iterations with Qiskit-compatible quantum inner products. We outline practical considerations and share an open-source implementation at https://github.com/AngshulMajumdar/quantum-dsdl-kaczmarz. The goal is not to claim exponential speedups, but to realign dictionary learning with the realities of near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction and Detection for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, quantum machine learning (QML) is poised to revolutionize artificial intelligence. However, the vulnerability of the current generation of quantum computers to noise and computational error poses a significant barrier to this vision. Whilst quantum error correction (QEC) offers a promising solution for almost any type of hardware noise, its application requires millions of qubits to encode even a simple logical algorithm, rendering it impractical in the near term. In this chapter, we examine strategies for integrating QEC and quantum error detection (QED) into QML under realistic resource constraints. We first quantify the resource demands of fully error-corrected QML and propose a partial QEC approach that reduces overhead while enabling error correction. We then demonstrate the application of a simple QED method, evaluating its impact on QML performance and highlighting challenges we have yet to overcome before we achieve fully fault-tolerant QML.</description>

      <title>Reply to Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our paper [1], our numerical simulations showed that, unlike displacement and conventional squeezing, higher-order squeezing exhibits oscillatory dynamics. Subsequently, Gordillo and Puebla pointed out that simulation results depend on whether the state space in the simulations is even or odd [2]. Using additional derivations, they argued that the oscillatory dynamics is unphysical and that the photon number must increase monotonically as a function of the squeezing parameter $r$. We agree with the observation of an even-odd parity dependence in the simulations. We independently noticed the same feature in our simulations after the publication of Ref. [1]. This observation led us to perform a more detailed investigation of the numerical simulation and mathematical aspects of the generalized squeezing problem. Our new findings were reported in Ref. [3]. Further analysis was reported in Ref. [4]. Our conclusion is that the generalized squeezing operator is physically not well defined but can be made well defined when combined with additional information about the physical system under study. We demonstrated this point in the case where we include an additional nonlinear interaction term in the Hamiltonian. We disagree with the claim that the photon number must be a monotonically increasing function of $r$. This claim contradicts the mathematically rigorous results of Ref. [4]. Furthermore, we show that the oscillatory behaviour persists in two closely related, well-behaved models.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant modular quantum computing with surface codes using single-shot emission-based hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant modular quantum computing requires stabilizer measurements across the modules in a quantum network. For this, entangled states of high quality and rate must be distributed. Currently, two main types of entanglement distribution protocols exist, namely emission-based and scattering-based, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. On the one hand, scattering-based protocols with cavities or waveguides are fast but demand stringent hardware such as high-efficiency integrated circulators or strong waveguide coupling. On the other hand, emission-based platforms are experimentally feasible but so far rely on Bell-pair fusion with extensive use of slow two-qubit memory gates, limiting thresholds to $\approx 0.16\%$. Here, we consider a fully distributed surface code using emission-based entanglement schemes that generate GHZ states in a single shot, i.e., without the need for Bell-pair fusions. We show that our optical setup produces Bell pairs, W states, and GHZ states, enabling both memory-based and optical protocols for distilling high-fidelity GHZ states with significantly improved success rates. Furthermore, we introduce protocols that completely eliminate the need for memory-based two-qubit gates, achieving thresholds of $\approx 0.19\%$ with modest hardware enhancements, increasing to above $\approx 0.24\%$ with photon-number-resolving detectors. These results show the feasibility of emission-based architectures for scalable fault-tolerant operation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Boundary Conditions on the Double-Kicked Quantum Rotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the on-resonance Spin-1/2 Double Kicked Rotor, a periodically driven quantum system that hosts topological phases. Motivated by experimental constraints, we analyze the effects of open and periodic boundary conditions in contrast to the idealized case of infinite momentum space. As a bulk probe for topological invariants, we focus on the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) and show that it exhibits a pronounced sensitivity to boundary conditions, which can be traced to the dynamics in momentum space. Under open boundaries, states that would otherwise extend freely become localized at the edges of the finite momentum space, forming quasienergy edge states. While the bulk response measured by the MCD is strongly affected once the evolving wave packet reaches the boundaries, the persistence of these edge states still reflects the bulk-edge correspondence and provides reliable signatures of topological transitions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Certification of Entanglement in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks form the backbone of long-distance quantum information processing. Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) serves as a key indicator of network performance and overall state quality. However, the widely used methods for certifying GME suffer from a major drawback that they either detect only a limited range of states or are applicable only to systems with a small number of parties. To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of sub-symmetric witnesses (SSWs), which are tractable both theoretically and experimentally. Analytically, we establish a connection between SSWs and the cut space of graph theory, enabling several powerful detection criteria tailored to practical quantum networks. Numerically, we show that the optimal detection can be formulated as a linear program, offering a significant efficiency advantage over the semidefinite programs commonly employed in quantum certification. Experimentally, SSWs can be evaluated via local measurements, with resource requirements independent of the local dimension in general, and even independent of the overall network size in many practical networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum model for black holes and clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stationary quantum system consisting of two non-interacting yet entangled subsystems, $\Xi$ and $\Gamma$. We identify a quantum theory characterizing $\Xi$ such that, in the quantum-to-classical crossover of the composite system, $\Gamma$ behaves as a test particle within the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild Black Hole (SBH) near its event horizon. We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $\Xi$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $\Xi$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $\Gamma$ and $\Xi$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $\Xi$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a "perfect" clock.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tim Maudlin has argued that the standard formulation of quantum mechanics fails to provide a clear ontology and dynamics and that the de Broglie--Bohm pilot-wave theory offers a better completion of the formalism, more in line with Einstein's concerns. I suggest that while Bohmian mechanics improves on textbook quantum theory, it does not go far enough. In particular, it relies on the ``quantum equilibrium hypothesis'' and accepts explicit nonlocality as fundamental. A deeper completion is available in stochastic mechanics, where the wavefunction and the Born rule emerge from an underlying diffusion process, and in a contextual, category-theoretic semantics in which measurement and EPR--Bell correlations are reinterpreted as features of contextual truth rather than of mysterious dynamics. In this framework, the measurement problem and ``spooky action-at-a-distance'' are dissolved rather than solved. Finally, a dynamics based on Rosen's ``classical Schr\"odinger equation'' provides a continuous passage between quantum and classical regimes, eliminating any sharp Heisenberg cut.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Recycling in Quantum Computing: Demonstration Using the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd Algorithm and Information Erasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branch selection, including postselection, is a standard method for implementing nonunitary transformations in quantum algorithms. Conventionally, states associated with unsuccessful branches are discarded and treated as useless. Here we propose a generic framework that reuses these failure branches as thermodynamic resources. The central element is an athermal bath that is naturally generated during the reset of a failure branch. By coupling this bath to a target system prior to relaxation, useful thermodynamic tasks can be performed, enabling performance beyond conventional thermodynamic limits. As an application, we analyze information erasure and derive the resulting gain analytically. We further demonstrate the framework by implementing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm on IBM's superconducting quantum processor. Despite substantial noise and errors in current hardware, our method achieves erasure with heat dissipation below the Landauer limit. These results establish a practical connection between quantum computing and quantum thermodynamics and suggest a route toward reducing thermodynamic costs in future large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Economic Manipulation of Dual-Type ${}^{171}$Yb$^+$ Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual-type qubit scheme is an emerging method to suppress crosstalk errors in scalable trapped-ion quantum computation and quantum network. Here we report a hardware-economic way to control dual-type $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ qubits using a single $355\,$nm mode-locked pulsed laser. Utilizing its broad frequency comb structure, we drive the Raman transitions of both qubit types encoded in the $S_{1/2}$ and the $F_{7/2}$ hyperfine levels, and probe their carrier transitions and the motional sidebands. We further demonstrate a direct entangling gate between the two qubit types. Our work can simplify the manipulation of the $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ qubits both at the hardware and the software level.</description>

      <title>Coupling a discrete state to a quasi-continuum: A model quantum mechanical system that interpolates between Rabi oscillations and decay-revival dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum mechanical system consisting of a single discrete state coupled to an infinite ladder of equally-spaced states, the coupling between the two being given by a Lorentzian profile. Various limits of this system correspond to well-known models from quantum optics, namely, the narrow resonance limit gives the Rabi system, the wide resonance limit gives the Bixon-Jortner system, the wide resonance, true continuum limit gives the Wigner-Weisskopf system, and the fixed resonance, true continuum limit gives a system that is typically studied by methods developed by Fano. We give a semi-analytical solution of the eigenvalue problem by reducing it to a transcendental equation, and demonstrate the aforementioned limiting behaviors. We then study the dynamics of the initial discrete state numerically, and show that it gives a wide range of behaviors in various limiting cases as predicted by our asymptotic theory including exponential decay, revivals, Rabi oscillations, and damped oscillations. The ability of this system to interpolate between such a rich set of behaviors and existing model systems, and the accessibility of a semi-analytical solution, make it a useful model system in quantum optics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal quantum Markov chain spectral gap estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a quantum algorithm for Markov chain spectral gap estimation that is quasi-optimal (i.e., optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor) in the number of vertices for all parameters, and additionally quasi-optimal in the reciprocal of the spectral gap itself, if the permitted relative error is above some critical value. In particular, these results constitute an almost quadratic advantage over the best-possible classical algorithm. Our algorithm also improves on the quantum state of the art, and we contend that this is not just theoretically interesting but also potentially practically impactful in real-world applications: knowing a Markov chain's spectral gap can speed-up sampling in Markov chain Monte Carlo.
  Our approach uses the quantum singular value transformation, and as a result we also develop some theory around block-encoding Markov chain transition matrices, which is potentially of independent interest. In particular, we introduce explicit block-encoding methods for the transition matrices of two algebraically-defined classes of Markov chains.</description>

      <title>On the Lifshitz formula of dispersion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lifshitz formula and methods of its preparation in the literature are considered. It is shown that in Lifshitz's work itself, this formula is given without a consistent conclusion. Moreover, the approach to the conclusion proposed in this work does not allow us to obtain it. The most general conclusion of this formula can be the method proposed by Levin and Rytov, the variation method of Schwinger and the method proposed by Van Kampen and co-authors. The Levin and Rytov approach is applicable in principle to bodies of arbitrary shape if the diffraction loss fields for electric and magnetic dipoles are determined, while the Van Kampen approach is applicable to any plane-layered structure and is quite simple. It is enough to write down the dispersion equations of the plasmon-polaritone structure. The specific dispersion force for a number of structures is calculated based on the Van Kampen method. It is shown that at small gaps, the force (pressure) density changes the inverse fourth-degree dependence on the distance and practically ceases to depend on it at distances less than 1 nm. For thin identical plates, this density is proportional to the square of their thickness at such distances, but the dependence quickly becomes saturated and already at thicknesses of the order of 10 nm practically ceases to depend on it.</description>

      <title>Bright Source of High-Dimensional Temporal Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement is considered to hold great potential for quantum key distribution (QKD) in high-loss and -noise scenarios. To harness its robustness, we construct a source for high-dimensional time-bin entangled photons optimized for high brightness, low complexity, and long-term stability. We certify the generated high-dimensional entanglement with a new witness employing nested Franson interferometry. Finally, we obtain key rates using a novel, noise-resilient QKD protocol. Our flexible evaluation method, centered around discretizations of the time stream, enables the same dataset to be processed while varying parameters such as state dimensionality and time bin length, allowing optimization of performance under given environmental conditions. Our results indicate regions within the accessible parameter space where high key rates per time are achievable for dimensionalities larger than two.</description>

      <title>Quantum information and statistical complexity of hydrogen-like ions in Dunkl-Schr\"odinger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present analytical solutions of Schr\"odinger equation for Coulomb potential in presence of a Dunkl reflection operator. Expressions are offered for eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and radial densities for H-isoelectronic series (Z=1-3). The degeneracy in energy in absence and presence of the reflection has been discussed. The standard deviation, Shannon entropy, R\'enyi entropy in position space have been derived for arbitrary quantum states. Then several important complexity measures like L\'opez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC), Shape-R\'enyi complexity (SRC), Generalized R\'enyi complexity (GRC), R\'enyi complexity ratio (RCR) are considered in the analytical framework. Representative results are given for three one-electron atomic ions in tabular and graphical format. Changes in these measures with respect to parity and Dunkl parameter have been given in detail. Most of these results are offered here for the first time.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for Bell inequalities from continuous-variable contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the original EPR paradox was formulated in terms of position and momentum, most studies of these phenomena have focused on measurement scenarios with only a discrete number of possible measurement outcomes. Here, we present a framework for studying non-locality that is agnostic to the dimension of the physical systems involved, allowing us to probe purely continuous-variable, discrete-variable, or hybrid non-locality. Our approach allows us to find the optimal Bell inequality for any given measurement scenario and quantifies the amount of non-locality that is present in measurement statistics. This formalism unifies the existing literature on continuous-variable non-locality and allows us to identify new states in which Bell non-locality can be probed through homodyne detection. Notably, we find the first example of continuous-variable non-locality that cannot be mapped to a CHSH Bell inequality. Moreover, we provide several examples of simple hybrid DV-CV entangled states that could lead to near-term violation of Bell inequalities.</description>

      <title>Finite-Memory Extension of Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07689v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tegmark's decoherence bound is derived under the assumption of a strictly memoryless environment. We show that this result corresponds to the singular limit of a finite-memory theory. For exponentially correlated environments decoherence is generically quadratic at short times and the decoherence time scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bath we derive the exact non-Markovian coherence equation and verify the predicted scaling using an exact pseudomode mapping. Tegmark's bound is recovered only in the vanishing-memory limit.</description>

      <title>Assembly to Quantum Compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a novel approach in quantum computing by transforming ARM assembly instructions for use in quantum algorithms. The core achievement is the development of a method to directly map the ARM assembly language, a staple in classical computing, to quantum computing paradigms. The practical application of this methodology is demonstrated through the computation of the Fibonacci sequence. This example serves to validate the approach and underscores its potential in simplifying quantum algorithms. Grover's Algorithm was realized through the use of quantum-specific instructions. These transformations were developed as part of an open-source assembly-to-quantum compiler (github.com/arhaverly/AssemblyToQuantumCompiler). This effort introduces a novel approach to utilizing classical instruction sets in quantum computing and offers insight into potential future developments in the field. The AssemblyToQuantumCompiler streamlines quantum programming and enables computer scientists to transition more easily from classical to quantum computer programming.</description>

      <title>TrackHHL: The 1-Bit Quantum Filter for particle trajectory reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) presents a computational challenge where particle reconstruction complexity may outpace classical computing resources. While quantum computing offers potential speedups, standard algorithms like Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) require prohibitive circuit depths for near-term hardware. Here, we introduce the 1-Bit Quantum Filter, a domain-specific adaptation of HHL that reformulates tracking from matrix inversion to binary ground-state filtering. By replacing high-precision phase estimation with a single-ancilla spectral threshold and exploiting the Hamiltonian's sparsity, we achieve an asymptotic gate complexity of $O(\sqrt{N} \log N)$, given Hamiltonian dimension $N$. We validate this approach by simulating LHCb Vertex Locator events with a toy model, and benchmark performance using the noise models of Quantinuum H2 trapped-ion and IBM Heron superconducting processors. This work establishes a resource-efficient track reconstruction method capable of solving realistic event topologies on noise-free simulators and smaller tracking scenarios within the current constraints of the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

      <title>Disorder enhanced transport as a general feature of long-range hopping models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the interplay of disorder and long-range hopping in a paradigmatic one dimensional model of quantum transport. While typically the current is expected to decrease as the disorder strength increases due to localization effects, in systems with infinite range hopping it was shown in Chavez et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153201 (2021), that the current can increase with disorder in the Disorder-Enhanced-Transport (DET) regime. Here, by analyzing models with variable hopping range decaying as $1/r^{\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ among the sites, we show that the DET regime is a general feature of long-range hopping systems and it occurs, not only in the strong long-range limit $\alpha&lt;1$ but even for weak long-range $1 \le \alpha \le 3$. Specifically, we show that, after an initial decrease, the current grows with the disorder strength until it reaches a local maximum. Both disorder thresholds at which the DET regime starts and ends are determined. Our results open the path to understand the effect of disorder on transport in many realistic systems where long range hopping is present.</description>

      <title>Computing quantum magic of state vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07824v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of quantum many-body states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods compute SRE and mana at cost $O(N d^{2N})$, providing an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, with substantial parallelism and straightforward GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG ( https://github.com/bsc-quantic/HadaMAG.jl/ ), which provides a high-performance toolbox for computing SRE and mana with built-in support for multithreading, MPI-based distributed parallelism, and GPU acceleration. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems combine the unique advantages of different physical platforms with the goal of realizing more powerful and practical quantum information processing devices. Mechanical systems, such as bulk acoustic wave resonators, feature a large number of highly coherent harmonic modes in a compact footprint, which complements the strong nonlinearities and fast operation times of superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate an architecture for mechanical resonator-based quantum computing, in which a superconducting qubit is used to perform quantum gates on a collection of mechanical modes. We show the implementation of a universal gate set, composed of single-qubit gates and controlled arbitrary-phase gates, and showcase their use in the quantum Fourier transform and quantum period finding algorithms. These results pave the way toward using mechanical systems to build crucial components for future quantum technologies, such as quantum random-access memories.</description>

      <title>The resource theory of causal influence and knowledge of causal influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11209v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying causal relationships between variables is essential for reasoning about the physical world. In this work, we develop a resource-theoretic framework to do so. Here, we focus on the simplest nontrivial setting -- two variables that are causally ordered, meaning that the first has the potential to influence the second, without hidden confounding. First, we introduce the resource theory that directly quantifies causal influence of a functional dependence in this setting and show that the problem of deciding convertibility of resources and identifying a complete set of monotones has a relatively straightforward solution. Following this, we introduce the resource theory that arises naturally when one has uncertainty about the functional dependence. We describe a linear program for deciding the question of whether one resource (i.e., state of knowledge about the functional dependence) can be converted to another. Then, we focus on the case where the variables are binary. In this case, we identify a triple of monotones that are complete in the sense that they capture the partial order over the set of all resources, and we provide an interpretation of each.</description>

Abstract: This note is a friendly technical check of arXiv:2511.21731v1. I highlight a few places where the manuscript's interpretation of (i) the reported CHSH/Bell-type calculations and (ii) Bose--Einstein (BE) fits to rank-frequency data seems to go beyond what the stated procedures can firmly support. I also point out one internal inconsistency in the "energy-level spacing" analogy. The aim is constructive: to keep the interesting empirical observations, while making clear what they do (and do not) imply about quantum entanglement in the usual Hilbert-space sense, especially when "energy" is defined by rank.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of non-F\"{o}rster exciton transfer mechanisms in perylene diimide donor, phenylene bridge, and terrylene diimide acceptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rates of exciton transfer within dyads of perylene diimide and terrylene diimide connected by oligophenylene bridge units have been shown to deviate significantly from those of F\"{o}rster's resonance energy transfer theory, according to single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from F\"{o}rster's spectral overlap expression.</description>

      <title>Mining Quantum Software Patterns in Open-Source Projects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has become an active research field in recent years, as its applications in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and materials science are promising. Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization. This indicates a maturing field where developers are increasingly using high-level building blocks to solve real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Creation and precise spectroscopy of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ halo molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the creation of $^{86}$Sr$_2$ molecules in the halo state and neighboring weakly bound states. Efficient molecule production via one-photon photoassociation relies on sufficient wavefunction overlap between the target vibrational states in the electronic excited- and ground-state potentials. Using Autler-Townes spectroscopy, transition strengths are measured to identify optimal pathways for production of weakly bound molecules. Vibrational splittings for the three least-bound vibrational states are measured, and dominant systematic uncertainties are evaluated with uncertainties below 100 Hz. From these splittings, absolute binding energies for these weakly bound vibrational states are determined. The results pave the way to a molecular isotope shift measurement with Sr$_2$.</description>

      <title>Controlling Rydberg atom-polariton interactions: from exceptional points to fast readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms represent a platform underpinning many recent developments in quantum computation, simulation, sensing, and metrology. They further facilitate optical nonlinearity at the single-photon level when coupled to photons propagating in atomic clouds, which form collective atomic excitations called Rydberg polaritons, strongly interacting with each other. Here, we experimentally explore interactions between a Rydberg polariton in an atomic ensemble and a single, adjacent, Rydberg atom. We discover three different regimes of quantum dynamics corresponding to polariton blockade, coherent exchange, and probabilistic hopping, which are defined by their distinct transmission characteristics, with a transition through an exceptional point occurring between blockade and coherent exchange. We investigate the applications of such interactions for fast, non-destructive detection of Rydberg atoms and present proof-of-principle demonstrations for their potential application in nonlinear photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Emission of time-ordered photon pairs from a single polaritonic Bogoliubov mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many-body quantum systems, interactions drive the emergence of correlations that are at the heart of the most intriguing states of matter. A remarkable example is the case of weakly interacting bosonic systems, whose ground state is a squeezed vacuum state, and whose elementary excitations have a collective nature. In this work, we report on the direct observation of the peculiar microscopic quantum structure of these elementary excitations. We perform time- and frequency-resolved two-photon correlation measurements on the fluctuations of weakly interacting polaritons in a resonantly-driven microcavity, and observe that upon decreasing the average number of fluctuation quanta below unity, large pair correlations build up together with strong time-ordering of the emitted photons. This behavior is a direct signature of the particle-hole quantum superposition which is at the heart of Bogoliubov excitations.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Computing the Petz-Augustin Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first algorithms with non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for computing the Petz-Augustin capacity, which generalizes the channel capacity and characterizes the optimal error exponent in classical-quantum channel coding. This capacity can be equivalently expressed as the maximization of two generalizations of mutual information: the Petz-R\'{e}nyi information and the Petz-Augustin information. To maximize the Petz-R\'{e}nyi information, we show that it corresponds to a convex H\"{o}lder-smooth optimization problem, and hence the universal fast gradient method of Nesterov (2015), along with its convergence guarantees, readily applies. Regarding the maximization of the Petz-Augustin information, we adopt a two-layered approach: we show that the objective function is smooth relative to the negative Shannon entropy and can be efficiently optimized by entropic mirror descent; each iteration of entropic mirror descent requires computing the Petz-Augustin information, for which we propose a novel fixed-point algorithm and establish its contractivity with respect to the Thompson metric. Notably, this two-layered approach can be viewed as a generalization of the mirror-descent interpretation of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm due to He et al. (2024).</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Brillouin Scattering in a Few-Mode Optical Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive experimental study of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in a few-mode optical fiber, resolving both forward and backward scattering processes for intra- and inter-modal interactions. Using heterodyne detection, Stokes and anti-Stokes components without external acoustic excitation are observed and quantitatively extracted Brillouin shifts, linewidths, and gain coefficients. Forward scattering is mediated by guided torsional-radial acoustic modes with frequencies ranging from MHz to GHz, while backward scattering involves longitudinal core-guided modes at frequencies of tens of GHz. These results provide calibrated benchmarks for Brillouin interactions in few-mode fibers, offering insights relevant to phonon-based quantum applications and mode-selective optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Orbital Angular Momentum in Vortex Light through Four-Wave Mixing and the Manipulation of Slow and Fast Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex light, a unique optical field that carries orbital angular momentum (OAM), has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we present a detailed theoretical analysis of OAM transfer from the input field to the generated signal field in a four-level double-Lambda system via the four-wave mixing (FWM) process, showing that their OAMs follow a specific algebraic relationship. We identify the optimal conditions for efficient vortex light transmission, analyze the influence of detuning on transmission efficiency and phase distortion, and specifically examine the scenario where the control field carries OAM the latter being essential for a complete characterization of OAM conservation in the FWM process, while all three aspects have been largely overlooked in the existing literature. Furthermore, we investigated the tunability of the group velocity between the probe and signal fields by modulating the Rabi frequencies of the two control fields and the relative phase between the probe and signal fields during the FWM process. We demonstrate that the conversion between matched vortex slow and fast light can be realized an effect that has not been widely explored in dual-Lambda-type systems. These results may hold promise for applications in quantum information storage and processing, quantum computing, and ultrasensitive detection.</description>

      <title>Wave Function Realism and the Mathematization of Nature. A Phenomenological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter reexamines wave function realism (WFR) through the lens of phenomenology. We begin by situating WFR within the broader debate about the ontology of the quantum state and the temptation to "read off" metaphysics from mathematical formalism. Against this background, we turn to the London-Bauer interpretation (LBI), the most explicit attempt to interpret quantum mechanics through phenomenological categories. On this view, the measurement transition is not a physical discontinuity but a reflective articulation of objectivity, and the wave function formally encodes the horizonal structure of world-givenness. We develop this idea by reconfiguring the notion of realism itself: not as objectivist, but as correlational and transcendental. The resulting picture suggests that quantum mechanics, rather than depicting a world "minus observers," mathematically articulates the very correlation through which a world becomes manifest at all.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions, topologically stable field configurations, have recently emerged in classical optics as structured light for high-density data applications. Achieving controllable on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions, while being highly desirable for quantum information technologies, remains challenging due to the nanoscale confinement of quantum emitters (QEs). Here we demonstrate a metasurface-integrated quantum emitter (metaQE) platform enabling room-temperature on-chip generation of single-photon skyrmions. Near-field coupling between QEs and propitiously designed surface arrays of meta-atoms mediates spin-orbit interaction, transforming nanoscale-localized dipole emission into free-propagating topologically structured photonic modes. By exploiting this approach for structuring quantum emission from different color centers in nanodiamonds, we realize diverse skyrmionic states, including high-order anti-skyrmions and skyrmionium, and thereby demonstrate its universality across QEs. Our work establishes a unified framework for on-chip structured quantum light sources, offering versatile control of high-dimensional topological states, such as skyrmions, and advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Artificial Entanglement in the Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure "Artificial Entanglement", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the "Entanglement Valley"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a "no-hair" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06821v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for controlling the Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a polariton optomechanical system. The system comprises an optical mode, a molecular vibrational mode, and $N$ excitonic modes, where excitons couple to molecular vibrations via conditional displacement interactions and to photons through electric dipole interactions. We show that the effective exciton-vibration coupling provides a powerful mechanism for coherent GHS control: in its absence, the system exhibits a pronounced GHS at resonance, while activating it strongly suppresses the shift. The effective cavity detuning and the cavity length serve as additional tunable parameters for GHS manipulation. Furthermore, increasing the collective exciton-optical coupling enhances the GHS. Our results establish a framework for probing the GHS in polariton optomechanical systems and offer new avenues for designing optical devices that exploit beam-displacement phenomena.</description>

      <title>Essentially No Energy Barrier Between Independent Fermionic Neural Quantum State Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have proven highly effective in representing quantum many-body wavefunctions, but their loss landscape remains poorly understood and debated. Here, we demonstrate that the NQS loss landscape is more benign and similar to conventional deep learning than previously thought, exhibiting mode connectivity: independently trained NQS are connected by paths in parameter space with essentially no energy barrier. To construct these paths, we develop GeoNEB, a path optimizer integrating efficient stochastic reconfiguration with the nudged elastic band method for constructing minimum energy paths. For the strongly interacting six-electron quantum dot modeled by a $1.6$M-parameter Psiformer, we find two independent minima with expected energy barrier $\sim10^{-5}$ times smaller than the system's overall energy scale and $\sim10^{-3}$ times smaller than the linear path's barrier. The path respects physical symmetry in addition to achieving low energy, with the angular momentum remaining well quantized throughout. Our work is the first to construct optimized paths between independently trained NQS, and it suggests that the NQS loss landscape may not be as pathological as once feared.</description>

      <title>Chiroptical effect induced by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the gravitational analog of the chiroptical effect for the first time, demonstrating that gravitational waves (GWs) can induce a reversal of photon chirality through the exchange of angular momentum, namely the spin-2-gravitation chiroptical effect. By analyzing the interaction between photon spin angular momentum (SAM) and GWs, we derive the selection rules governing this exchange, which are strictly dictated by the spin-1 and spin-2 nature of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, respectively. We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs. This mechanism provides a novel observational pathway to constrain modified gravity theories, measure the asymmetric properties of compact binaries, and explore parity-violating physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Excitation spectrum of a bright solitary wave in a Bose-Einstein condensate and its connection with the Higgs and the Goldstone modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms, which are confined in a (quasi) one-dimensional toroidal potential. We focus on the case of an effective attractive interaction between the atoms. The formation of a localized blob (i.e., a ``bright" solitary wave) for sufficiently strong interactions provides an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We evaluate analytically and numerically the excitation spectrum for both cases of a homogeneous and of a localized density distribution. We identify in the excitation spectrum the emergence of the analogous to the Goldstone and the Higgs modes, evaluating various relevant observables, gaining insight into these two fundamental modes of excitation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic anomalous Hall effect in distorted kagome GdTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological kagome magnets offer a rich landscape for exploring the intricate interplay of quantum interactions among geometry, topology, spin, and correlation. GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Clock transitions are well known in atomic and solid-state systems, but are largely unexplored in molecular liquids. Here we demonstrate a clock-like, nuclear-spin avoided crossing in [1--$^{13}$C]-fumarate that supports long-lived and directly observable coherences at ultralow magnetic field: a three-spin transition $|S_0\alpha\rangle \leftrightarrow |T_{+1}\beta\rangle$ near 400 nT exhibits a shallow crossing with a frequency minimum of 2 Hz. The transition is first-order immune to magnetic field perturbations and displays a lifetime of 25 s, around three times the longest single-spin $T_2^*$. Sensitivity to effective pseudo-fields is also demonstrated, including the internal dipolar field of the sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate superconducting transmission lines as a novel platform for realizing a quantum fluid of microwave photons in a propagating geometry. We predict that the strong photon-photon interactions provided by the intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions are sufficient to enter a regime of strongly interacting photons for realistic parameters. A suitable tapering of the transmission line parameters allows for the adiabatic conversion of an incident coherent field into a Tonks-Girardeau gas of fermionized photons close to its ground state. Signatures of the strong correlations are anticipated in the correlation properties of the transmitted light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most numerical methods for time integration use real-valued time steps. Complex time steps, however, can provide an additional degree of freedom, as we can select the magnitude of the time step in both the real and imaginary directions. We show that specific paths in the complex time plane lead to expanded stability regions, providing clear computational advantages for complex-valued systems. In particular, we highlight the Schr\"odinger equation, for which complex time integrators can be uniquely optimal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these benefits extend to certain classes of real-valued stiff systems by coupling complex time steps with the Projective Integration method.</description>

      <title>Phase transition, phase separation and mode softening of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superradiant phase transition in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with distinct atomic detunings, confined in an optical cavity and driven by a transverse pump laser. By combining perturbation theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the phase transition is dominated by the red-detuned component, resulting in a phase diagram completely different from that of a single-component case under blue-detuned condition. The system exhibits spontaneous phase separation between the two components, manifested as alternating stripe patterns in the normal phase and distinct Bragg gratings in the superradiant phase. Furthermore, the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum reveals roton-type mode softening, indicating that the phase transition also corresponds to the superfluid-to-lattice supersolid transition. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between atomic detunings and collective quantum many-body phenomena, offering potential applications in quantum simulation and optical switching technologies.</description>

Abstract: Analog coprocessors are intensively developing nowadays with the aim to optimize energy computations of neural networks. In this work we focus on the possibility of using detection of collective oscillations in optical systems for computational purposes. We show that in a system of coupled resonators, collective oscillations can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a fundamental relation between the structures of physical space and of quantum theory: the set of quantum correlations in a rotational prepare-and-measure scenario can be derived from covariance alone, without assuming quantum physics. To show this, we consider a semi-device-independent randomness generation scheme where one of two spatial rotations is performed on an otherwise uncharacterized preparation device, and one of two possible measurement outcomes is subsequently obtained. An upper bound on a theory-independent notion of spin is assumed for the transmitted physical system. It turns out that this determines the set of quantum correlations and the amount of certifiable randomness in this setup exactly. Interestingly, this yields the basis of a theory-independent protocol for the secure generation of random numbers. Our results support the conjecture that the symmetries of space and time determine at least part of the probabilistic structure of quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing necessitates the transition of worldwide cryptosystems to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which is founded upon the problem of finding short vectors in high-dimensional structured lattices. It is assumed that the structure of these lattices cannot be exploited by quantum or classical algorithms attempting to find short vectors. In this work, we focus on the structure of the lattices used in PQC protocols - nega-cyclic (and cyclic)lattices - and provide a quantum algorithmic framework that efficiently encodes the structured lattices into Hamiltonians by exploiting their underlying symmetries. The efficient encoding substantially reduces the dimension of the corresponding Hilbert space by limiting it to a relevant subspace where short vectors are likely to be found - leading to significant savings in quantum resources (e.g. qubit count and circuit depth) required to implement a quantum algorithm for finding short vectors. We analytically prove the efficient encoding procedure and benchmark the proposed framework using the variational quantum eigensolver, demonstrating improved results with reduced quantum resources.</description>

Abstract: The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</description>

Abstract: Recent research has shown that syndrome-based belief propagation using layered scheduling (sLBP) can not only accelerate the convergence rate but also improve the error rate performance by breaking the quantum trapping sets for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, showcasing a result distinct from classical error correction codes. In this paper, we consider edge-wise informed dynamic scheduling (IDS) for QLDPC codes based on syndrome-based residual belief propagation (sRBP). However, the construction of QLDPC codes and the identical prior intrinsic information assignment will result in an equal residual in many edges, causing a performance limitation for sRBP. Two heuristic strategies, including edge pool design and error pre-correction, are introduced to tackle this obstacle and quantum trapping sets. Then, a novel sRBP equipped with a predict-and-reduce-error mechanism (PRE-sRBP) is proposed, which can provide over one order of performance gain on the considered bicycle codes and symmetric hypergraph (HP) code under similar iterations compared to sLBP.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Quantum Phase Transition in Open Systems: System-Bath Interaction at the Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16514v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.</description>

      <title>Surveying optically addressable spin qubits for quantum information and sensing technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11232v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies offer ways to solve certain tasks more quickly, efficiently, and with greater precision than their classical counterparts. Yet substantial challenges remain in the construction of sufficiently error-free and scalable quantum platforms needed to unlock any real benefits to society. Acknowledging that this hardware can take vastly different forms, our review here focuses on so-called spintronic (\textit{i.e.}~spin-electronic) materials that use electronic or nuclear spins to embody qubits. Towards helping the reader to spot trends and pick winners, we have surveyed the various families of optically addressable spin qubits and attempted to benchmark and identify the most promising ones in each. We go on to reveal further trends that demonstrate how qubit lifetimes depend on the material's synthesis, the concentration/distribution of its embedded qubits, and the experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of quantum entanglement state between photoelectron spin and emitted photon polarization in spin and polarization resolved XEPECS of $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the mechanism of quantum entanglement between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ XEPECS process for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$. In the calculation, we used a realistic $\rm TiO_{6}$-type cluster model with the full multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between the Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. We found that quantum entanglement occurs between the spin of photoelectrons and linear polarization of emitted X-ray photons and that it depends on the angular geometry in the XEPECS process. In addition, we found that the degree of spin and polarization entanglement decreases as the Ti 3$d\ $- O 2$p$ hybridization becomes stronger and as the crystal field modifies the electronic states in terms of the tangle, an index for the degree of entanglement. These results highlight the crucial role of the charge transfer and crystal field effects in determining entanglement properties in real material systems.</description>

      <title>Low-loss Nb on Si superconducting resonators from a dual-use spintronics deposition chamber and with acid-free post-processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used for this purpose; with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (\SI{3}{\micro\meter} gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal. These results will inform nanofabrication for other superconducting materials and the integration of magnetic materials for hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics Simulation of the Advection-Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advection-diffusion equation is simulated on a superconducting quantum computer via several quantum algorithms. Three formulations are considered: (1) Trotterization, (2) variational quantum time evolution (VarQTE), and (3) adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS). These schemes were originally developed for the Hamiltonian simulation of many-body quantum systems. The finite-difference discretized operator of the transport equation is formulated as a Hamiltonian and solved without the need for ancillary qubits. Computations are conducted on a quantum simulator (IBM Qiskit Aer) and an actual quantum hardware (IBM Fez). The former emulates the latter without the noise. The predicted results are compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data with infidelities of the order $10^{-5}$. In the quantum simulator, Trotterization is observed to have the lowest infidelity and is suitable for fault-tolerant computation. The AVQDS algorithm requires the lowest gate count and the lowest circuit depth. The VarQTE algorithm is the next best in terms of gate counts, but the number of its optimization variables is directly proportional to the number of qubits. Due to current hardware limitations, Trotterization cannot be implemented, as it has an overwhelming large number of operations. Meanwhile, AVQDS and VarQTE can be executed, but suffer from large errors due to significant hardware noise. These algorithms present a new paradigm for computational transport phenomena on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Quantum Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) offer a promising approach to combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are scalable and robust, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to diverse real-world problems. To address this, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by GraphSAGE, using quantum models as aggregators. We integrate inductive representation learning techniques with parameterized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, allowing tailored designs for specific tasks. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, our framework, using a single minimal circuit for all aggregation steps, handles molecules with varying numbers of atoms without changing qubits or circuit architecture. While classical GNNs achieve higher training performance, our quantum approach remains competitive and often shows stronger generalization as molecular complexity increases. We also observe faster learning in early training epochs. To mitigate trainability limitations of a single-circuit setup, we extend the framework with multiple quantum aggregators on QM9. Assigning distinct circuits to each hop substantially improves training performance across all cases. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus as qubit numbers increase, suggesting that the proposed model can scale to larger, more complex graph-based problems.</description>

Abstract: We describe our investigations concerning the sonification of measured data from experiments involving various mesoscopic mechanical oscillator systems cooled down close to their quantum ground states, and music generation from a programmed quantum computer that subjects a single quantum bit ("qubit") to various unitary rotations, composed in order to test for the breakdown of macroscopic realism as expressed by the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality. "Listening'' to data via their resulting sonifications facilitates the discovery of signals that might otherwise be hard to detect in common graphic (i.e., visual) representations, and for the quantum computer music experiment provides a complementary way to discern when the measured qubit data violates macroscopic realism with some prior listening training. The resulting soundscapes and music also provide a complementary window into the quantum realm that is accessible to non-experts with open ears.</description>

      <title>Generalized cross-resonance scheme for maximally-entangling two-qutrit gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To utilize higher-dimensional quantum systems, in this Letter, we derive a generalized cross-resonance (GCR) scheme for realizing maximally entangling two-qutrit gates on fixed-frequency transmons beyond the 0-1 subspace. Our two-qutrit gates, namely, $U_{CR}^{01}$ and $U_{CR}^{12}$, acting on the $0{\text -}1$ and $1{\text -}2$ energy transitions of transmons, respectively, directly allow for entanglement on the $1{\text -}2$ levels. Unlike the known works, our gate is parametric in nature, enabling us to construct multiple entangling gates of interest. By performing simulations in Qiskit, we demonstrate two-qutrit generalized controlled-$X$ ($U_{CX}^{01}$ and $U_{CX}^{12}$) and controlled-$H$ ($U_{CH}^{01}$ and $U_{CH}^{12}$) gates, which are instances of the proposed $U_{CR}$ gates, with reported gate fidelities of $86.14\%~(99.73\%),~84.6\%~(97.88\%),~92.35\%~(99.39\%)$, and $91.99\%~(98.99\%)$, respectively with (and without) noise. We also reveal a two-qutrit Bell state with a fidelity of $99.06 \pm 0.01\%$, with a complete Bell state preparation in a $\sim514$ ns pulse sequence, which is less than the gate time of the known scheme by cross-Kerr-based entangling gates.</description>

      <title>Experimental Certification of Quantum Measurements with Maximally Mixed States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: So far, certifying quantum devices from their input-output statistics, under minimal assumptions, required the preparation of specific pure quantum states. Recently, Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 140201 (2024)] have demonstrated that certain sets of quantum observables can be certified using any state of full rank. However, their method is restricted to ideal conditions. Here, we address this problem and present an experimentally robust method that eliminates the need of preparing states with high fidelity with respect to specific pure states. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by experimentally certifying photonic devices implementing Peres' set of 24 ququart observables [J. Phys. A 24, L175 (1991)] and Yu and Oh's set of 13 qutrit observables [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 030402 (2012)], using maximally mixed states as input. This approach offers a crucial advantage for certifying high-dimensional quantum systems, since it works with maximally mixed and thermal states.</description>

Abstract: We examine the two-party perfect quantum teleportation of an unknown 1-qubit state in the case of sharing various 3-qubit entangled states between a sender and a receiver: GHZ state, W state and W-like state. We give an impossibility proof that the W state cannot be used as the sharing state to realize the perfect quantum teleportation for transmitting an arbitrary 1-qubit state, in sharp contrast with the GHZ state which is well known to realize the perfect quantum transportation. Moreover, we give a procedure of obtaining a modified entangled state which we call the W-like state to achieve the perfect quantum transportation under a prescribed measurement basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum advantage schemes probe the boundary between classically simulatable and classically intractable quantum dynamics. We explore the impact of mid-circuit measurements on the computational power of quantum circuits. To this effect, we focus on quantum sampling and introduce a constant-depth measurement-driven approach for efficiently sampling from a broad class of commuting diagonal quantum circuits and associated structured phase states, previously requiring polynomial-depth unitary circuits. By interleaving mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward in randomized "fan-out staircases", our dynamical circuits bypass Lieb-Robinson light-cone constraints, enabling global entanglement with flexible auxiliary qubit usage on bounded-degree lattices (e.g., two-dimensional grids). The generated phase states exhibit random-matrix statistics and anti-concentration comparable to fully random architectures. We further demonstrate measurement-driven feature maps that distinguish phases of an extended SSH model from random eigenstates in a quantum machine-learning benchmark (reservoir computing). Technologically, our results harness mid-circuit measurements to realize quantum advantages on bounded-degree hardware with a favorable topology. Conceptually, they provide complexity-theoretic support for quantum speedups by mid-circuit measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics are a cornerstone of physics. At the nanoscale, where fluctuations and quantum effects matter, there is no unique thermodynamic framework because thermodynamic quantities such as heat and work depend on the accessibility of the degrees of freedom. We derive a thermodynamic framework for coherently driven systems, where the output light is assumed to be accessible. The resulting second law of thermodynamics is strictly tighter than the conventional one and it demands the output light to be more noisy than the input light. We illustrate our framework across several well-established models and we show how the three-level maser can be understood as an engine that reduces the noise of a coherent drive. Our framework opens a new avenue for investigating the noise properties of driven-dissipative quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a low-pass-filter (LPF) feedback control for cooling a trapped particle with a low-pass filter, which utilizes a shift of the potential caused by the feedback operation. By incorporating this shift in the energy cost function, we show that the LPF control can achieve the minimum phonon occupation number that is lower than cold damping with a band-pass filter, that with delayed feedback, and linear--quadratic--Gaussian (LQG) control, the last two of which are the standard methods of ground-state cooling of a levitated nanoparticle. For the detection efficiency of $90\%$, the achievable phonon occupation number with the LPF control is about one third, two fifths and one half of that of cold damping with a band-pass filter, that with delayed feedback, and LQG control, respectively. Thus our method has a decisive advantage to reach the absolute ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary errors, such as those arising from fault-tolerant compilation of quantum algorithms, systematically bias observable estimates. Correcting this bias typically requires additional resources, such as an increased number of non-Clifford gates. In this work, we present an alternative method for correcting bias in the expectation values of observables. The method leverages a decomposition of the ideal quantum channel into a probabilistic mixture of noisy quantum channels. Using this decomposition, we construct unbiased estimators as weighted sums of expectation values obtained from the noisy channels. We provide a detailed analysis of the method, identify the conditions under which it is effective, and validate its performance through numerical simulations. In particular, we demonstrate unbiased observable estimation in the presence of unitary errors by simulating the time dynamics of the Ising Hamiltonian. Our strategy offers a resource-efficient way to reduce the impact of unitary errors, improving methods for estimating observables in noisy near-term quantum devices and fault-tolerant implementation of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked' to the photoelectron's spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality while the latter is reminiscent of the Rashba effect in solids</description>

Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice (FSL) of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the FSL, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the FSL, we introduce a physically motivated and directly measurable topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, computed using a phase-space parameter, is related to the invariant. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected spin states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</description>

      <title>State change via one-dimensional scattering in quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to address the nature of state change, measurement, and probabilistic outcomes in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We consider a pair of particles that interact in a one-dimensional setting via a delta-function potential. One of the particles is confined to a one-dimensional box, and the other particle is free. The free particle is incident from the left with specified energy, and it may cause changes in state of the confined particle before flying away to the left or to the right. We present a formulation and computational scheme that avoids the use of perturbation theory and determines the probability of any such outcome as a function of the initial state of the confined particle and the energy of the incident particle. As demonstrated by a direct comparison, this presented method holds multiple advantages over a standard perturbative method. The problem formulation and corresponding computational scheme may have applications in physical settings which admit one-dimensional scattering, e.g., in the study of quantum wires or quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Analog Circuit-QED Simulator of Quantum Spin Dynamics Through the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and validate a framework for analog simulation of the Heisenberg spin model using a circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit-QED) platform. Our method involves the Dyson-Maleev transformation, for which we develop a procedure to circumvent its inherent non-Hermiticity, yielding the extended Bose-Hubbard (EBH) Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the equivalence of this approach to the Holstein-Primakoff encoding for spin-1/2 systems. For the experimental realization of this EBH model, we design a scalable circuit-QED architecture based on an engineered Josephson junction array. Numerical simulations confirm that the microwave photon dynamics in this simulator accurately reproduces the original spin dynamics. Our work establishes an experimentally accessible method for investigating complex quantum spin dynamics in a highly controllable bosonic setting.</description>

      <title>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</description>

      <title>The spatiotemporal Born rule is quasiprobabilistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrary to general relativity, quantum theory treats space and time in fundamentally different ways. In particular, while joint probabilities associated with spacelike separated measurements are defined in terms of the Born rule, joint probabilities associated with measurements performed in sequence are defined in terms of the state-update rule. In this work, we show that one obtains a more unified perspective of space and time in quantum theory by embracing a quasiprobabilistic description of sequential measurements. More precisely, we show that there exists a unique \emph{pseudo}-density operator encoding canonical quasiprobabilities associated with sequential measurements in precisely the same manner that a density operator encodes joint probabilities associated with spacelike separated measurements, thus providing a natural extension of the Born rule into the temporal domain. As an application, we show how such a spatiotemporal Born rule combined in conjunction with a quantum Bayes' rule yields an operational notion of time-reversal symmetry for sequential measurements on an \emph{open} quantum system.</description>

      <title>Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.</description>

      <title>Entangling Power and Its Deviation: A Quantitative Analysis on Input-State Dependence and Variability in Entanglement Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the entangling capability of quantum operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. Traditionally, this capability is measured by the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated when a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states. However, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of entanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric -- entangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement generated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted nature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework that yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis shows that any nontrivial entangling operation necessarily exhibits input-state dependence: nonzero EP implies a nonzero EPD. By analyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical EP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of entanglement generation can significantly differ depending on the gate functionality. Extending our framework to a class of generalized controlled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimensions, we further analyze the interplay between the entangling strength and uniformity, as quantified by EP and EPD. Moreover, we uncover a subtle dimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone fails to detect. These findings highlight EPD as an indispensable diagnostic tool -- one that, alongside EP, provides a deeper and more complete characterization of the entangling structure.</description>

      <title>Beyond asymptotic reasoning: the practicalities of a quantum ground state projector based on the wall-Chebyshev expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. In a classical setting, this approach is appealing as it guarantees rapid convergence. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and success probabilities of different quantum implementations and provide numerical benchmarks, comparing the performance of the wall-Chebyshev projectors with current state-of-the-art approaches. We find that this approach requires fewer serial applications of the Hamiltonian oracle to achieve a given ground state fidelity, but is severely limited by exponentially decaying success probability. However, we find that some implementations maintain non-trivial success probability in regimes where wall-Chebyshev projection leads to a fidelity improvement over other approaches. As the wall-Chebyshev projector is highly robust to loose known upper bounds on the true ground state energy, it offers a potential resource trade-off, particulary in the early fault-tolerant regime of quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental scalability barriers, primarily due to barren plateaus and sensitivity to quantum noise. To address these challenges, we introduce TensorHyper-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided hypernetwork framework that significantly improves the robustness and scalability of VQC. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Grounded in Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensorHyper-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, including hardware-level validation on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor. These results position TensorHyper-VQC as a scalable and noise-resilient framework for advancing practical quantum machine learning on near-term devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured reservoir acts as a single geometric control that can store, revive, or suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms, offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic driving is used to steer physical systems to unique stationary states or nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), producing enhanced properties inaccessible to non-driven systems. For open quantum systems, characterizing the NESS is challenging and existing results are generally limited to specific types of driving and the Born-Markov approximation. Here we go beyond these limits by studying a generic periodically driven $ N$-level quantum system interacting with a low-density thermal gas. Exploiting the framework of Floquet scattering theory, we establish general Floquet thermalization conditions constraining the nature of the NESS and the transition rates. Moreover, we examine theoretically the structure of the NESS in the high temperature limit, and find out that the NESS complies, rather surprisingly, with an uniform probability distribution (predicted by the Boltzmann law) for any driving. Numerical calculations illustrate our theoretical elaborations for a simple toy model.</description>

      <title>Attaining Quantum Sensing Enhancement from Monitored Dissipative Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum-enhanced parameter estimation through continuous monitoring in open quantum systems that exhibit a dissipative time crystal phase. We first analytically derive the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) rate for boundary time crystals (BTCs), demonstrating that within the time-crystal phase, the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$. We then generalize this finding to a broader class of dynamics, including the transverse collective dephasing (TCD) model, which achieves a time-crystal phase through a closing Liouvillian gap without requiring a dissipative phase transition. We proceed to numerically demonstrate that this maximal global QFI rate is experimentally attainable for both the BTC and TCD models, even at finite system sizes, via continuous homodyne and photodetection. Moving towards practical implementations, we analyze the precision limits under inefficient detection, revealing a critical difference: for BTC dynamics, inefficiencies asymptotically restore a classical scaling, and only a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible. In contrast, for TCD dynamics, a super-classical scaling is still in principle observable, and our numerical simulations confirm its presence, even under inefficient measurement conditions, establishing the TCD model as a highly robust platform for quantum metrology.</description>

Abstract: Existing quantum routing implicitly mimics classical routing principles, with finding the ``best'' path (aka pathfinding), according to a selected routing metric, as a core mechanism for establishing end-to-end entanglement. However, optimal pathfinding is computationally intensive, particularly in complex topologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to quantum routing, which avoids the inherent overhead of conventional quantum pathfinding, by establishing directly entanglement between remote nodes. Our approach exploits graph complement strategies. It allows to improve the flexibility and efficiency of quantum networks, by paving the way for more practical quantum communication infrastructures.</description>

Abstract: The extraction of EPR pairs and n-qubits GHZ states among remote nodes in quantum networks constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand communications. However, the Bell-VM problem, which determines whether a given graph state can be transformed into a set of Bell pairs on specific vertices (not necessarily remote), is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend this problem, not only by focusing on nodes remote within generic graph states, but also by determining the number of extractable n-qubit remote GHZ states -- beside the number of remote EPR pairs. The rationale for tackling the extraction of GHZ states among remote nodes, rather than solely remote EPR pairs, is that a GHZ state enables the dynamic extraction of an EPR pair between any pair of nodes sharing the state. This, in turn, implies the ability of accommodating the traffic requests on-the-fly. Specially, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the aforementioned NP-complete problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively adapt to generic graph states for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.</description>

Abstract: The quantum switch, a process enabling a coherent superposition of different orders of quantum channels, has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable noiseless communications through noisy channels, such as entanglement-breaking channels. However, its practical implementation and scalability remain challenging. In contrast, the spatial superposition of quantum channels is more accessible experimentally and has been shown to enhance channel capacity, although it does not match the performance of the quantum switch. In this work, we present preliminary theoretical results demonstrating that, by applying tools of the quantum random walk framework to the spatial superposition of channels, it is possible to replicate the output of a quantum switch. These findings suggest a promising and more feasible route to emulate the quantum switch, offering both practical advantages and interpretative clarity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework -- Quantum Neural Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (QNODEs and QNPDEs) -- which extends the continuous-time formalism of classical neural ordinary and partial differential equations into quantum machine learning and quantum control. QNODEs denote the evolution of finite-dimensional quantum systems, whereas QNPDEs denote their infinite-dimensional (continuous-variable) counterparts; both are governed by generalised Schr\"odinger-type Hamiltonian dynamics, coupled with a corresponding loss function. This formalism permits gradient estimation via an adjoint-state method, facilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that can be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we present quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time discretisation, achieving efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be intractable on classical devices. We provide detailed resource estimates for these algorithms and investigate the local energy landscape for training. The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state preparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the learning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many cases of interest, the Hamiltonian is composed of a relatively small number of local operators, yet the corresponding classical simulation remains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient estimation. This continuous-time perspective can also serve as a blueprint for designing novel quantum neural network architectures, generalising discrete-layered models into continuous-depth models.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Four-Photon Interference in a Deployed Metropolitan Fiber Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced quantum-networking protocols beyond point-to-point links rely critically on the ability to perform multi-photon interference under realistic operating conditions. Yet experimental validation of such higher-order interference effects in deployed metropolitan fiber networks remains limited. Here, we report a field demonstration of polarization-controlled reconfigurable four-photon interference over a commercially deployed metropolitan fiber network. Using a fully fiber-coupled linear-optical platform, we observe a fusion-type four-photon interference signature in the presence of real-world impairments, including photon loss, polarization drift, and timing uncertainty. By performing polarization-resolved measurements on two locally retained photons, we conditionally select distinct two-photon coincidence channels that exhibit Bell-like and N00N-like behavior under an idealized source model. Rather than pursuing multi-partite entanglement verification, this work focuses on establishing the technical feasibility of multi-photon interference and reconfigurable conditional state preparation in an operational network environment. These results serve as a systems-level validation milestone toward future multi-photon quantum-networking architectures that require robust interference performance outside the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Quantum deliberating machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the familiar circuit-based quantum computational setting, we introduce and analyze a toy model of a quantum physical device capable of internal, self-referential deliberation. The key idea is to represent ``deliberation'' as a coherent iterative branching process, in which competing branch-dependent system evolutions are maintained in superposition, with additional control and memory registers recording branch histories, and the policy register adaptively biasing subsequent development. We provide explicit quantum circuit realizations and carry out detailed step-by-step derivations of the entangled control--memory--system--policy dynamics. We carefully distinguish between internally adaptive and internally reinforced deliberations, proposing the architectures for both, and briefly discuss categorical and controlled--Stinespring reformulations, as well as their conceptual implications. The primary construction models a memory-driven deliberation where the policy update depends on which actions were taken, not on their results. We also present a simple extension that allows for minimalistic, outcome-driven policy updates, implementing a coherent feedback loop that steers the system toward a target state regardless of initial branch-dependent evolution. This loop can be interpreted as a quantum autopilot or search-and-rescue mechanism, illustrating how a device can autonomously correct and optimize its internal strategy in superposition. Finally, we briefly consider various implementations of a dialogue that may take place between two deliberating machines. Taken together, this frames the proposed model as a plausible setting for exploring how such devices may maintain multiple alternatives in parallel, while performing an internal decision-making process through coherent branching, entanglement, adaptive policy updates, and policy-driven self-modifying unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>SQuaD: Smart Quantum Detection for Photon Recognition and Dark Count Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum detectors of single photons are an essential component for quantum information processing across computing, communication and networking. Today's quantum detection system, which consists of single photon detectors, timing electronics, control and data processing software, is primarily used for counting the number of single photon detection events. However, it is largely incapable of extracting other rich physical characteristics of the detected photons, such as their wavelengths, polarization states, photon numbers, or temporal waveforms. This work, for the first time, demonstrates a smart quantum detection system, SQuaD, which integrates a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with a neural network model, and is designed to recognize the features of photons and to eliminate detector dark-count. The SQuaD is a fully integrated quantum system with high timing-resolution data acquisition, onboard multi-scale data analysis, intelligent feature recognition and extraction, and feedback-driven system control. Our \name experimentally demonstrates 1) reliable photon counting on par with the state-of-the art commercial systems; 2) high-throughput data processing for each individual detection events; 3) efficient dark count recognition and elimination; 4) up to 100\% accurate feature recognition of photon wavelength and polarization. Additionally, we deploy the SQuaD to an atomic (erbium ion) photon emitter source to realize noise-free control and readout of a spin qubit in the telecom band, enabling critical advances in quantum networks and distributed quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>PhotonIDs: ML-Powered Photon Identification System for Dark Count Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26315v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2 times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Block-Encoding Tensor Networks and QUBO Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an algorithm that converts any tensor network (TN) into a sequence of local unitaries whose composition block-encodes the network contraction, suitable for Quantum Eigenvalue / Singular Value Transformation (QET/QSVT). The construction embeds each TN as a local isometry and dilates it to a unitary. Performing this step for every site of the tensor, allows the full network to be block-encoded. The theory is agnostic to virtual-bond sizes; for qubit resource counts and examples we assume global power-of-two padding. Further, we present a deterministic sweep that maps Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) / Ising Hamiltonians into Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) and general TN. We provide formal statements, pseudo-code, resource formulae, and a discussion of the use for state preparation and learning of general quantum operators.</description>

      <title>Velocity effects slightly mitigating the quantumness degradation of an Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the velocity effects on information degradation due to the Unruh effect in accelerated quantum systems (with finite interaction time). We consider a detector moving along a spatial trajectory within a two-dimensional plane. The quantum systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and which-path distinguishability circuit. Thus, for non-relativistic velocity regime, we obtained analytical expressions such as transition rates, quantum coherence, visibility, distinguishability, and the complementarity relation. On the other hand, for the ultra-relativistic velocity regime, we saw that the Unruh effect is suppressed and therefore the detector does not respond in this case. Our findings revealed that velocity effects imply mitigation of information degradation, this interesting behaviors happen because of the composite effect of both velocity and acceleration. The results obtained show that the addition of the non-relativistic, transverse and constant motion of an accelerated detector can play a protective role in quantumness in systems at high accelerations, although the effects are very small.</description>

      <title>Simple Quantum Algorithm for Approximate $k$-Mismatch Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $k$-mismatch problem, given a pattern and a text of length $n$ and $m$ respectively, we have to find if the text has a sub-string with a Hamming distance of at most $k$ from the pattern. This has been studied in the classical setting since 1982 and recently in the quantum computational setting by Jin and Nogler and Kociumaka, Nogler, and Wellnitz. We provide a simple quantum algorithm that solves the problem in an approximate manner, given a parameter $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$. It returns an occurrence as a match only if it is a $\left(1+\epsilon\right)k$-mismatch. If it does not return any occurrence, then there is no $k$-mismatch. This algorithm has a time (size) complexity of $\tilde{O}\left( \epsilon^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{mn}{k}} \right)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Filtering at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.</description>

      <title>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer is a fundamental requirement for scalable quantum computation, where fast and reliable communication between distant subsystems is essential. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum state transfer in linear Ising chains. Starting from a perfect state transfer scheme via a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with inhomogeneous couplings, we adapt it for architectures implementing the transverse-field Ising model by encoding the information in domain walls. The resulting linear Ising chain makes quantum transport experiments accessible to many platforms for analog quantum simulation. We test the protocol for 1-, 2-, and 3- spin states, obtaining high transfer fidelities of up to 0.99 and study the accuracy dependence on the domain wall approximation. These results are the first step in paving the way for an experimental implementation of the protocol.</description>

Abstract: The state hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) is a recent generalization of the hidden subgroup problem. We present an algorithm that solves the non-abelian StateHSP over $N$ copies of the dihedral group of order $8$ (the symmetries of a square). This algorithm is of interest for learning non-Pauli stabilizers, as well as related symmetries relevant for the problem of Hamiltonian spectroscopy. Our algorithm is polynomial in the number of samples and computational time, and requires only constant depth circuits. This result extends previous work on the abelian StateHSP and, as a special case, provides a solution for the ordinary hidden subgroup problem on this specific non-abelian group.</description>

      <title>An Information-Minimal Geometry for Qubit-Efficient Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit-efficient optimization studies how large combinatorial problems can be addressed with quantum circuits whose width is far smaller than the number of logical variables. In quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), objective values depend only on one- and two-body statistics, yet standard variational algorithms explore exponentially large Hilbert spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometric question: what is the minimal representation the objective itself requires?
  Focusing on QUBO problems, we show that enforcing mutual consistency among pairwise statistics defines a convex body -- the level-2 Sherali-Adams polytope -- that captures the information on which quadratic objectives depend. We operationalize this geometry in a minimal variational pipeline that separates representation, consistency, and decoding: a logarithmic-width circuit produces pairwise moments, a differentiable information projection enforces local feasibility, and a maximum-entropy ensemble provides a principled global decoder.
  This information-minimal construction achieves near-optimal approximation ratios on large unweighted Max-Cut instances (up to N=2000) at shallow depth, indicating that pairwise polyhedral geometry already captures the relevant structure in this regime. By making the information-minimal geometry explicit, this work establishes a clean baseline for qubit-efficient optimization and sharpens the question of where genuinely quantum structure becomes necessary.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks, the quantum analogue to the classical random walk, have been shown to model fluid dynamics. Neutral atom hardware is a promising choice of platform for implementing quantum walks due to its ability to implement native multiqubit ($\geq\!3$-qubit) gates and to dynamically re-arrange qubits. Using error modelling for multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid passage, we present the gate sequences and predicted final state fidelities for some toy quantum walks, including `lazy' quantum walks. These `lazy' quantum walks include a rest state and therefore provide an integral step towards quantum walks for fluid simulation.</description>

Abstract: Berry monopoles always cancel when summing over a complete set of energy eigenstates. We demonstrate that analogous sum rules exist for geometric phases and their underlying 2-forms in non-adiabatic evolution. Our result has implications for qudit computation as it limits the types of gates that can be implemented by purely geometric means.</description>

Abstract: Photon detection is a cornerstone of quantum technology, traditionally regarded as a static device-level operation constrained by the intrinsic physical properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). Consequently, high-performance detection has been heavily reliant on superconducting technologies, whose requirement for cryogenic temperatures imposes significant infrastructure burdens and limits scalable deployment. To circumvent these constraints, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detection (ESPD) framework, which shifts the photon-detection paradigm from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing (QIP) task. By incorporating state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy decision analysis, we establish a nonlinear dynamical model that reformulates detection as an iteratively enhanced process. This architecture enables systematic performance upgrades through structural design rather than material modification, allowing high-performance detection with exclusively room-temperature hardware. Through analytical approximations, Monte Carlo analysis, and numerical simulations, we show that the ESPD dynamics converge to a high-performance basin of attraction even when initialized by low-performance SPDs. While physical realization requires further component integration efforts, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing detection via architectural QIP principles. It provides not only a blueprint for next-generation room-temperature photon detection but also a general methodology for transcending device-level constraints in broader quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Automated Compilation Including Dropouts: Tolerating Defective Components in Stabiliser Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Symmetry Merging in Pauli Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Error mitigation for logical circuits using decoder confidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Systematic Construction of Time-Dependent Hamiltonians for Microwave-Driven Josephson Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Electrical Control of Optically Active Single Spin Qubits in ZnSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons bound to shallow donors in ZnSe quantum wells are promising candidates for optically addressable spin qubits and single-photon sources. However, their optical coherence and indistinguishability are often limited by spectral broadening arising from charge fluctuations in the local environment. Here, we report electrical control of single donor qubits in ZnSe quantum wells. The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression. Our results identify electrical control as a versatile pathway to significantly improve optical and spin addressability.</description>

      <title>Partial Collapse and Ensemble Invariance under Continuous Quantum Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavefunction collapse is commonly associated with unavoidable physical disturbance of the measured system. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can induce strong trajectory-level collapse while leaving the ensemble-averaged steady state strictly invariant. We identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite pronounced measurement-induced localization in conditioned quantum trajectories. This separation between trajectory-level collapse and ensemble invariance defines a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is continuously counteracted by dissipative dynamics. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and identify Liouvillian symmetry as a concrete dynamical mechanism enforcing it. Our results clarify the distinction between conditional collapse and physical disturbance in open quantum systems and provide a framework for non-invasive continuous monitoring in driven-dissipative settings.</description>

      <title>Casimir Arc Plate Geometry: Computational Analysis of Thickness Constraints for Gold and Silver Nanomembranes in MEMS Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir &gt; U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Entanglement Distillation: Error Exponents via Postselected Quantum Hypothesis Testing Against Separable States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation and entanglement cost are fundamental tasks in quantum entanglement theory. This work studies both in the probabilistic setting and focuses on the asymptotic error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation when the operational model is $\delta$-approximately nonentangling or $\delta$-approximately dually nonentangling quantum instruments. While recent progress has clarified limitations of probabilistic transformations in general resource theories, an analytic formula for the error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation under approximately (dually) nonentangling operations has remained unavailable. Building on the framework of postselected quantum hypothesis testing, we establish a direct connection between probabilistic distillation and postselected hypothesis testing against the set of separable states. In particular, we derive an analytical characterization of the distillation error exponent under $\delta$-approximately nonentangling quantum instruments. Besides, we relate the exponent to postselected hypothesis testing with measurements restricted to be separable. We further investigate probabilistic entanglement dilution and establish a relation between probabilistic entanglement costs under approximately nonentangling and approximately dually nonentangling instruments, together with a bound on the probabilistic entanglement cost under nonentangling instruments.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Data Center Architectures: A Performance and Scalability Perspective</title>

Abstract: Scalable distributed quantum computing (DQC) has motivated the design of multiple quantum data-center (QDC) architectures that overcome the limitations of single quantum processors through modular interconnection. While these architectures adopt fundamentally different design philosophies, their relative performance under realistic quantum hardware constraints remains poorly understood.
  In this paper, we present a systematic benchmarking study of four representative QDC architectures-QFly, BCube, Clos, and Fat-Tree-quantifying their impact on distributed quantum circuit execution latency, resource contention, and scalability. Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance. Across diverse circuit workloads, we evaluate how architectural properties such as path diversity and path length, and shared BSM (Bell State Measurement) resources interact with optical-switch insertion loss and reconfiguration delay. Our results show that distributed quantum performance is jointly shaped by topology, scheduling policies, and physical-layer parameters, and that these factors interact in nontrivial ways. Together, these insights provide quantitative guidance for the design of scalable and high-performance quantum data-center architectures for DQC.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers are inherently noisy, and a crucial challenge for achieving large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing is to implement quantum error correction. A promising direction that has made rapid recent progress is to design hardware that has a specific noise profile, leading to a significantly higher threshold for noise with certain quantum error correcting codes. This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators. We also discuss the differences between implementations; near-term applications using quantum error detection; and the open problems for developing this approach towards early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum Channels in Diamond Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ \Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A= rd_B$, and $\Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon^2 \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A\le rd_B/2$. These lower bounds improve upon the best previous $\Omega(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence, and they are optimal up to logarithmic factors. The proof constructs ensembles of channels that are well separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum system that interacts with an environment generally undergoes nonunitary evolution described by a non-Markovian or Markovian master equation. In this paper, we construct the non-Markovian Redfield master equation for a quantum scalar field that interacts with a second field through a bilinear or nonlinear interaction on a Minkowski background. We use the resulting master equation to set up coupled differential equations that can be solved to obtain the equal-time two-point function of the system field. We show how the equations simplify under various approximations including the Markovian limit and argue that the Redfield equation-based solution provides a perturbative resummation to the standard second-order Dyson series result. For the bilinear interaction, we explicitly show that the Redfield solution is closer to the exact solution compared to the perturbation theory-based one. Further, the environment correlation function is oscillatory and nondecaying in this case, making the Markovian master equation a poor approximation. For the nonlinear interaction, on the other hand, the environment correlation function is sharply peaked and the Redfield solution matches that obtained using a Markovian master equation in the late-time limit.</description>

      <title>CANISIUS The Austrian Neutron Spin Echo Interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The broad band resonant spin echo interferometer, CANISIUS, is presented. CANISIUS is built in a versatile way, such that it can be operated in both a continuous broad band beam or a pulsed Time of Flight beam. This versatility also extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant Spin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent averaging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemical Reactions: Achieving Accuracy with NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a continuous-variable quantum algorithm to compute the projection coefficients of a holomorphic function in the Segal--Bargmann space by leveraging its isometric correspondence with single-mode quantum states. Using CV quantum circuits, we prepare the state $\ket{f}$ associated with $f(z)$ and extract the coefficients $c_n = \braket{n}{f}$ via photon-number-resolved detection, enhanced by interferometric phase referencing to recover full complex amplitudes. This enables direct quantum estimation and visualization of the coefficient sequence -- offering a scalable, measurement-based alternative to classical numerical integration for functional analysis and non-Gaussian state characterization.</description>

      <title>Universal low-depth two-unitary design of programmable photonic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of large-scale, programmable photonic circuits capable of performing generic matrix-vector multiplication is essential for both classical and quantum information processing. However, this goal is hindered by high losses, hardware errors, and difficulties in programmability. We propose an enhanced architecture for programmable photonic circuits that minimizes circuit depth and offers analytical programmability, properties that have not been simultaneously achieved in previous circuit designs. Our proposal exploits a previously overlooked representation of general nonunitary matrices as sums of two unitaries. Furthermore, similar to the traditional singular value decomposition-based circuits, the circuits in our unitary-sum-based architecture inherit the advantages of the constituent unitary circuits. Overall, our proposal provides a significantly improved solution for matrix-vector multiplication compared to the established approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate low-frequency noise in a spin-qubit device made in isotopically purified Si/Si-Ge. Observing sizable cross-correlations among energy fluctuations of different qubits, we conclude that these fluctuations are dominated by charge noise. At low frequencies, the noise spectra are not well described by a power law; instead, they reveal the presence of a few individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs). We demonstrate that the noise cross-correlations allow one to get information on the spatial location of such individual TLFs.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Hole States in Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Approaches: A Time-Domain Generalization of Extended Koopmans' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for resolving electron-hole dynamics within wavefunction-based multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) theory. Central to this framework is a time-domain generalization of the extended Koopmans' theorem, which rigorously defines time-dependent hole states through single-electron removal. From this foundation, we prove the existence of exact equations of motion for time-dependent Dyson orbitals, enabling instantaneous construction of photofragments' reduced density matrices. The formalism further yields a systematic procedure to extract hole-resolved observables, such as channel-resolved photoelectron momentum distributions, directly from time-dependent \textit{ab initio} wavefunctions. As a demonstration, we employ an attosecond $\omega-2\omega$ laser strategy to control hole dynamics, thereby resolving a long-standing challenge in MCTDHF simulations. This advance opens a pathway for exploring correlated multielectron dynamics in atoms and molecules under ultrafast laser fields.</description>

      <title>Three-boson scattering hypervolume for a nonzero orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range interactions. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation asymptotically, we derive two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$ studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and $\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas. The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of interaction.</description>

      <title>Observe novel tricritical phenomena in self-organized Fermi gas induced by higher order Fermi surface nesting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice with dynamically tunable spacing to create and study bright matter-wave solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</description>

      <title>Metaplectic time-frequency representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</description>

      <title>Subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees.
  Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>Advantages and disadvantages of maximally entangled states in dilaton black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.</description>

      <title>Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic-stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection -- whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms -- is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group Is the Principle behind the Holographic Entropy Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every holographic entropy inequality can be recast in the form: "some entanglement wedges reach deeper in the bulk than some other entanglement wedges." When the inequality is saturated, the two sets of wedges reach equally deep. Because bulk depth geometrizes CFT scales, the inequalities enforce and protect the holographic Renormalization Group.</description>
