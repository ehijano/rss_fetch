      <title>On the Reachability Problem for Two-Dimensional Branching VASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vectors addition systems with states (VASS), or equivalently Petri nets, are arguably one of the most studied formalisms for the modeling and analysis of concurrent systems. A central decision problem for VASS is reachability: whether there exists a run from an initial configuration to a final one. This problem has been known to be decidable for over forty years, and its complexity has recently been precisely characterized. Our work concerns the reachability problem for BVASS, a branching generalization of VASS. In dimension one, the exact complexity of this problem is known. In this paper, we prove that the reachability problem for 2-dimensional BVASS is decidable. In fact, we even show that the reachability set admits a computable semilinear presentation. The decidability status of the reachability problem for BVASS remains open in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>From MBQI to Enumerative Instantiation and Back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the relation between model-based quantifier instantiation (MBQI) and enumerative instantiation (EI) in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). MBQI operates at the semantic level and guarantees to find a counterexample to a given a non-model. However, it may lead to weak instantiations. In contrast, EI strives for completeness by systematically enumerating terms at the syntactic level. However, such terms may not be counter-examples. Here we investigate the relation between the two techniques and report on our initial experiments of the proposed algorithm that combines the two.</description>

      <title>Compositional Control-Driven Boolean Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean circuits abstract away from physical details to focus on the logical structure and computational behaviour of digital components. Despite they have been studied for many decades, compositionality has been widely ignored or examined in an informal manner, which is a property for combining circuits without delving into their internal structure, while supporting modularity and formal reasoning. In this paper, we address this longstanding theoretical gap by proposing colimit-based operators for compositional circuit construction. We define separate operators for forming sequential, parallel, branchial and iterative circuits. As composites encapsulate explicit control flow, a new model of computation emerges which we refer to as (families of) control-driven Boolean circuits. We show how this model is at least as powerful as its classical counterpart. In other words, it is able to non-uniformly compute any Boolean function on inputs of arbitrary length.</description>

      <title>Questions as cognitive filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a logico-algebraic framework for modeling decision-making through deliberation in multi-agent settings. The central concept in this framework is that of interrogative agendas, which represent the cognitive stances of agents regarding which features should be considered relevant in the final decision. We formalize an agent's interrogative agenda as an equivalence relation that identifies outcomes differing only in aspects the agent deems irrelevant. Moreover, we characterize the sublattices of the resulting lattice that correspond to relevant interrogative agendas for deliberation scenarios governed by different ``winning rules." We then introduce a two-sorted logico-algebraic structure-comprising the lattice of relevant interrogative agendas and the Boolean algebras of agent coalitions-to model the interaction between agents and agendas during deliberation. Finally, we discuss which interaction conditions can and cannot be defined within this framework.</description>

      <title>Model-theoretic Forcing in Transition Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study L\"owenheim-Skolem and Omitting Types theorems in Transition Algebra, a logical system obtained by enhancing many sorted first-order logic with features from dynamic logic. The sentences we consider include compositions, unions, and transitive closures of transition relations, which are treated similarly to actions in dynamic logics to define necessity and possibility operators. We show that Upward L\"owenheim-Skolem theorem, any form of compactness, and joint Robinson consistency property fail due to the expressivity of transitive closures of transitions. In this non-compact many-sorted logical system, we develop a forcing technique method by generalizing the classical method of forcing used by Keisler to prove Omitting Types theorem. Instead of working within a single signature, we work with a directed diagram of signatures, which allows us to establish Downward L\"owenheim-Skolem and Omitting Types theorems despite the fact that models interpret sorts as sets, possibly empty. Building on a complete system of proof rules for Transition Algebra, we extend it with additional proof rules to reason about constructor-based and/or finite transition algebras. We then establish the completeness of this extended system for a fragment of Transition Algebra obtained by restricting models to constructor-based and/or finite transition algebras.</description>

      <title>One-Parametric Presburger Arithmetic has Quantifier Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a quantifier elimination procedure for one-parametric Presburger arithmetic, the extension of Presburger arithmetic with the function $x \mapsto t \cdot x$, where $t$ is a fixed free variable ranging over the integers. This resolves an open problem proposed in [Bogart et al., Discrete Analysis, 2017]. As conjectured in [Goodrick, Arch. Math. Logic, 2018], quantifier elimination is obtained for the extended structure featuring all integer division functions $x \mapsto \lfloor{\frac{x}{f(t)}}\rfloor$, one for each integer polynomial $f$.
  Our algorithm works by iteratively eliminating blocks of existential quantifiers. The elimination of a block builds on two sub-procedures, both running in non-deterministic polynomial time. The first one is an adaptation of a recently developed and efficient quantifier elimination procedure for Presburger arithmetic, modified to handle formulae with coefficients over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ of univariate polynomials. The second is reminiscent of the so-called "base $t$ division method" used by Bogart et al. As a result, we deduce that the satisfiability problem for the existential fragment of one-parametric Presburger arithmetic (which encompasses a broad class of non-linear integer programs) is in NP, and that the smallest solution to a satisfiable formula in this fragment is of polynomial bit size.</description>

      <title>Querying Attack-Fault-Defense Trees: Property Specification in Smart Grid and Aerospace Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces AFDL, a logic-based framework for reasoning about safety, security, and defense interactions in Attack-Fault-Defense Trees, which is a model that captures all safety, security, and defense domains in a single framework. We showcase both AFDL and propose a structured domain specific query language, LangAFDL, which enables domain experts to express complex analysis goals through intuitive templates. LangAFDL supports both Boolean and quantified queries as well as minimal cut set analysis, capturing the interplay between safety, security, and defensive measures. We illustrate the expressiveness and utility of the approach through representative queries over two different real-world case studies: Gridshield and Ground Segment as a Service. The formalization lays the automated safety-security groundwork for analyses in mission-critical systems and paves the way for future tool development and integration into design workflows.</description>

      <title>Protocol insecurity with finitely many sessions and XOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a different proof of the insecurity problem for XOR, solved in by Chevalier, Kuesters, Rusinowitch and Turuani (2005). Our proof uses the notion of typed terms and well-typed proofs, and removes a restriction on the class of protocols to which the [CKRT05] proof applies, by introducing a slightly different (but very natural) notion of protocols, where honest agent sends are derivable from previous receives in the same session.</description>

      <title>Universal Gluing and Contextual Choice: Categorical Logic and the Foundations of Analytic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new categorical and constructive foundation for analytic approximation based on a Contextual Choice Principle (CCP), which enforces locality and compatibility in the construction of mathematical objects. Central to our approach is the Universal Embedding and Linear Approximation Theorem (UELAT), which establishes that functions in broad spaces -- including C(K), Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Omega), and distributions D'(Omega) -- can be explicitly approximated by finite-rank linear projections, each with a constructive, algorithmically verifiable certificate of accuracy.
  These constructions are governed categorically by a functorial adjunction between local logical probes and analytic models, making analytic existence both formally certifiable and programmatically extractable. As a key result, we prove a uniform certificate stability theorem, ensuring that approximation certificates persist under uniform convergence.
  The CCP avoids classical pathologies (e.g., non-measurable sets, Banach--Tarski paradoxes) by eliminating non-constructive choice and replacing it with a coherent, local-to-global semantic logic. Our framework strengthens the foundations of constructive analysis while contributing tools relevant to formal verification, type-theoretic proof systems, and computational mathematics.</description>

      <title>Resilient-Native and Intelligent Next-Generation Wireless Systems: Key Enablers, Foundations, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Just like power, water, and transportation systems, wireless networks are a crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient. This requires them to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks, unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is based on the understanding that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, as elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents and networks that can flexibly expand their states and hypotheses through real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This situational awareness and active preparedness, adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about potential system failures and the best responses, is a core aspect of resilience. This article will first disambiguate resilience from reliability and robustness, before delving into key mathematical foundations of resilience grounded in abstraction, compositionality and emergence. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the unique characteristics of resilience, as well as their applications through a comprehensive set of use cases. Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to establish a unified foundation for understanding, modeling, and engineering resilience in wireless communication systems, while laying a roadmap for the next-generation of resilient-native and intelligent wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Small Circuit Classes from FAC^0 to FAC^1 via Discrete Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a uniform framework for investigating small circuit classes and bounds through the lens of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Following an approach recently introduced to capture the class of polynomial-time computable functions via ODE-based recursion schemas and later applied to the context of functions computed by unbounded fan-in circuits of constant depth (FAC^0), we study multiple relevant small circuit classes. In particular, we show that natural restrictions on linearity and derivation along functions with specific growth rate correspond to kinds of functions that can be proved to be in various classes, ranging from FAC^0 to FAC^1. This reveals an intriguing link between constraints over linear-length ODEs and circuit computation, providing new tools to tackle the complex challenge of establishing bounds for classes in the circuit hierarchies and possibly enhancing our understanding of the role of counters in this setting. Additionally, we establish several completeness results, in particular obtaining the first ODE-based characterizations for the classes of functions computable in constant depth with unbounded fan-in and Mod 2 gates (FACC[2]) and in logarithmic depth with bounded fan-in Boolean gates (FNC1).</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Dream of Discrete Algorithms?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, enabling natural language interfaces and dynamic orchestration of software components. However, their reliance on probabilistic inference limits their effectiveness in domains requiring strict logical reasoning, discrete decision-making, and robust interpretability. This paper investigates these limitations and proposes a neurosymbolic approach that augments LLMs with logic-based reasoning modules, particularly leveraging Prolog predicates and composable toolsets. By integrating first-order logic and explicit rule systems, our framework enables LLMs to decompose complex queries into verifiable sub-tasks, orchestrate reliable solutions, and mitigate common failure modes such as hallucination and incorrect step decomposition. We demonstrate the practical benefits of this hybrid architecture through experiments on the DABStep benchmark, showing improved precision, coverage, and system documentation in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results indicate that combining LLMs with modular logic reasoning restores engineering rigor, enhances system reliability, and offers a scalable path toward trustworthy, interpretable AI agents across complex domains.</description>

Abstract: We introduce BayesL, a novel logical framework for specifying, querying, and verifying the behaviour of Bayesian networks (BNs). BayesL (pronounced "Basil") is a structured language that allows for the creation of queries over BNs. It facilitates versatile reasoning concerning causal and evidence-based relationships, and permits comprehensive what-if scenario evaluations without the need for manual modifications to the model.</description>

      <title>Higher Catoids, Higher Quantales and their Correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\omega$-catoids as generalisations of
  (strict) $\omega$-categories and in particular the higher path
  categories generated by computads or polygraphs in
  higher-dimensional rewriting. We also introduce $\omega$-quantales
  that generalise the $\omega$-Kleene algebras recently proposed for
  algebraic coherence proofs in higher-dimensional rewriting. We then
  establish correspondences between $\omega$-catoids and convolution
  $\omega$-quantales. These are related to J\'onsson-Tarski-style
  dualities between relational structures and lattices with operators.
  We extend these correspondences to $(\omega,p)$-catoids, catoids
  with a groupoid structure above some dimension, and convolution
  $(\omega,p)$-quantales, using Dedekind quantales above some
  dimension to capture homotopic constructions and proofs in
  higher-dimensional rewriting. We also specialise them to finitely
  decomposable $(\omega, p)$-catoids, an appropriate setting for
  defining $(\omega, p)$-semirings and $(\omega, p)$-Kleene
  algebras. These constructions support the systematic development and
  justification of $\omega$-Kleene algebra and $\omega$-quantale
  axioms, improving on the recent approach mentioned, where axioms for
  $\omega$-Kleene algebras have been introduced in an ad hoc fashion.</description>

      <title>Lov\'asz Theorems for Modal Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A famous result due to Lov\'{a}sz states that two finite relational structures $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic if, and only if, for all finite relational structures $T$, the number of homomorphisms from $T$ to $M$ is equal to the number of homomorphisms from $T$ to $N$. Since first-order logic (FOL) can describe finite structures up to isomorphism, this can be interpreted as a characterization of FOL-equivalence via homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to the class of finite structures. We identify classes of labeled transition systems (LTSs) such that homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to these classes, where "counting" is done within an appropriate semiring structure, captures equivalence with respect to positive-existential modal logic, graded modal logic, and hybrid logic, as well as the extensions of these logics with either backward or global modalities. Our positive results apply not only to finite structures, but also to certain well-behaved infinite structures. We also show that equivalence with respect to positive modal logic and equivalence with respect to the basic modal language are not captured by homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to any class of LTSs, regardless of which semiring is used for counting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12574v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed systems can be subject to various kinds of partial failures, therefore building fault-tolerance or failure mitigation mechanisms for distributed systems remains an important domain of research. In this paper, we present a calculus to formally model distributed systems subject to crash failures with recovery. The recovery model considered in the paper is weak, in the sense that it makes no assumption on the exact state in which a failed node resumes its execution, only its identity has to be distinguishable from past incarnations of itself. Our calculus is inspired in part by the Erlang programming language and in part by the distributed $\pi$-calculus with nodes and link failures (D$\pi$F) introduced by Francalanza and Hennessy. In order to reason about distributed systems with failures and recovery we develop a behavioral theory for our calculus, in the form of a contextual equivalence, and of a fully abstract coinductive characterization of this equivalence by means of a labelled transition system semantics and its associated weak bisimilarity. This result is valuable for it provides a compositional proof technique for proving or disproving contextual equivalence between systems.</description>

      <title>Coslice Colimits in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We contribute to the theory of (homotopy) colimits inside homotopy type theory. The heart of our work characterizes the connection between colimits in coslices of a universe, called coslice colimits, and colimits in the universe (i.e., ordinary colimits). To derive this characterization, we find an explicit construction of colimits in coslices that is tailored to reveal the connection. We use the construction to derive properties of colimits. Notably, we prove that the forgetful functor from a coslice creates colimits over trees. We also use the construction to examine how colimits interact with orthogonal factorization systems and with cohomology theories. As a consequence of their interaction with orthogonal factorization systems, all pointed colimits (special kinds of coslice colimits) preserve $n$-connectedness, which implies that higher groups are closed under colimits on directed graphs. We have formalized our main construction of the coslice colimit functor in Agda. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/PHart3/colimits-agda .</description>

      <title>Games with $\omega$-Automatic Preference Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Nash equilibria (NEs) in multi-player turn-based games on graphs, where player preferences are modeled as $\omega$-automatic relations via deterministic parity automata. Unlike much of the existing literature, which focuses on specific reward functions, our results apply to any preference relation definable by an $\omega$-automatic relation. We analyze the computational complexity of determining the existence of an NE (possibly under some constraints), verifying whether a given strategy profile forms an NE, and checking whether a specific outcome can be realized by an NE. When a (constrained) NE exists, we show that there always exists one with finite-memory strategies. Finally, we explore fundamental properties of $\omega$-automatic relations and their implications in the existence of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Query Algorithms for Relational Structures Based on Homomorphism Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A query algorithm based on homomorphism counts is a procedure to decide membership for a class of finite relational structures using only homomorphism count queries. A left query algorithm can ask the number of homomorphisms from any structure to the input structure and a right query algorithm can ask the number of homomorphisms from the input structure to any other structure. We systematically compare the expressive power of different types of left or right query algorithms, including non-adaptive query algorithms, adaptive query algorithms that can ask a bounded number of queries, and adaptive query algorithms that can ask an unbounded number of queries. We also consider query algorithms where the homomorphism counting is done over the Boolean semiring $\mathbb{B}$, meaning that only the existence of a homomorphism is recorded, not the precise number of them.</description>

      <title>A Formal Analysis of Algorithms for Matroids and Greedoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formal analysis, in Isabelle/HOL, of optimisation algorithms for matroids, which are useful generalisations of combinatorial structures that occur in optimisation, and greedoids, which are a generalisation of matroids. Although some formalisation work has been done earlier on matroids, our work here presents the first formalisation of results on greedoids, and many results we formalise in relation to matroids are also formalised for the first time in this work. We formalise the analysis of a number of optimisation algorithms for matroids and greedoids. We also derive from those algorithms executable implementations of Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, an algorithm for maximum cardinality matching for bi-partite graphs, and Prim's algorithm for computing minimum weight spanning trees.</description>

      <title>Forward and Backward Simulations for Partially Observable Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data refinement is the standard extension of a refinement relation from programs to datatypes (i.e. a behavioural subtyping relation). Forward/backward simulations provide a tractable method for establishing data refinement, and have been thoroughly studied for nondeterministic programs. However, for standard models of mixed probability and nondeterminism, ordinary assignment statements may not commute with (variable-disjoint) program fragments. This (1) invalidates a key assumption underlying the soundness of simulations, and (2) prevents modelling probabilistic datatypes with encapsulated state.
  We introduce a weakest precondition semantics for Kuifje$_\sqcap$, a language for partially observable Markov decision processes, using so-called loss (function) transformers. We prove soundness of forward/backward simulations in this richer setting, modulo healthiness conditions with a remarkable duality: forward simulations cannot leak information, and backward simulations cannot exploit leaked information.</description>

      <title>StepProof: Step-by-step verification of natural language mathematical proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified. Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification, further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.</description>

      <title>Locality in Residuated-Lattice Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-valued models generalise the structures from classical model theory by defining truth values for a model with an arbitrary algebra. Just as algebraic varieties provide semantics for many non-classical propositional logics, models defined over algebras in a variety provide the semantics for the corresponding non-classical predicate logics. In particular models defined over varieties of residuated lattices represent the model theory for first-order substructrual logics.
  In this paper we study the extent to which the classical locality theorems from Hanf and Gaifman hold true in the residuated lattice setting. We demonstrate that the answer is sensitive both to how locality is understood in the generalised context and the behaviour of the truth-defining algebra. In the case of Hanf's theorem, we will show that the theorem fails for the natural understanding of local neighbourhoods, but is recoverable in one special case for well-connected residuated lattices. For Gaifman's theorem, rather than consider Gaifman normal forms directly we focus on the main lemma of the theorem from textbook proofs. We prove that for a number of different understandings of locality, provided the algebra is well-behaved enough to express locality in its syntax, this main lemma can be recovered. In each case we will see that importance of an order-interpreting connective which creates a link between the modelling relation between models and formulas and the valuation function from formulas into the algebra.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Model-Checking Quantum Pushdown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of model-checking quantum pushdown systems from a computational complexity point of view. We arrive at the following equally important, interesting new results:
  We first extend the notions of the {\it probabilistic pushdown systems} and {\it Markov chains} to their quantum analogues and investigate the question of whether it is necessary to define a quantum analogue of {\it probabilistic computational tree logic} to describe the probabilistic and branching-time properties of the {\it quantum Markov chain}. We study its model-checking question and show that model-checking of {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems (qBPA)} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL)} is generally undecidable, i.e., there exists no algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it probabilistic computational tree logic}.
  We then study in which case there exists an algorithm for model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} and show that the problem of model-checking {\it stateless quantum pushdown systems} against {\it bounded probabilistic computational tree logic} (bPCTL) is decidable, and further show that this problem is in $NP$-complete. Our reduction is from the {\it bounded Post Correspondence Problem} for the first time, a well-known $NP$-complete problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non-wellfounded proof system for intuitionistic logic extended with ordinary inductive and co-inductive definitions, based on a syntax in which fixpoint formulas are annotated with explicit variables for ordinals. We explore the computational content of this system, in particular we introduce a notion of computability and show that every valid proof is computable. As a consequence, we obtain a normalization result for proofs of what we call finitary formulas. A special case of this result is that every proof of a sequent of the appropriate form represents a unique function on natural numbers. Finally, we derive a categorical model from the proof system and show that least and greatest fixpoint formulas correspond to initial algebras and final coalgebras respectively.</description>

      <title>WATCHDOG: an ontology-aWare risk AssessmenT approaCH via object-oriented DisruptiOn Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When considering risky events or actions, we must not downplay the role of involved objects: a charged battery in our phone averts the risk of being stranded in the desert after a flat tyre, and a functional firewall mitigates the risk of a hacker intruding the network. The Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER) highlights how the role of objects and their relationships remains pivotal to performing transparent, complete and accountable risk assessment. In this paper, we operationalize some of the notions proposed by COVER -- such as parthood between objects and participation of objects in events/actions -- by presenting a new framework for risk assessment: WATCHDOG. WATCHDOG enriches the expressivity of vetted formal models for risk -- i.e., fault trees and attack trees -- by bridging the disciplines of ontology and formal methods into an ontology-aware formal framework composed by a more expressive modelling formalism, Object-Oriented Disruption Graphs (DOGs), logic (DOGLog) and an intermediate query language (DOGLang). With these, WATCHDOG allows risk assessors to pose questions about disruption propagation, disruption likelihood and risk levels, keeping the fundamental role of objects at risk always in sight.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Dominating Set and Related Problems Using Twin-Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial vertex cover and partial dominating set are two well-investigated optimization problems. While they are $\rm W[1]$-hard on general graphs, they have been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable on many sparse graph classes, including nowhere-dense classes. In this paper, we demonstrate that these problems are also fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the twin-width of a graph. Indeed, we establish a more general result: every graph property that can be expressed by a logical formula of the form $\phi\equiv\exists x_1\cdots \exists x_k \sum_{\alpha \in I} \#y\,\psi_\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y)\ge t$, where $\psi_\alpha$ is a quantifier-free formula for each $\alpha \in I$, $t$ is an arbitrary number, and $\#y$ is a counting quantifier, can be evaluated in time $f(d,k)n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $d$ is the width of a contraction sequence that is part of the input. In addition to the aforementioned problems, this includes also connected partial dominating set and independent partial dominating set.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that no family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits can factorize a constant fraction of all products of two $n$-bit primes, we show that the bounded arithmetic theory $\text{PV}_1$, even when augmented by the sharply bounded choice scheme $BB(\Sigma^b_0)$, cannot prove that every number has some prime divisor. By the completeness theorem, it follows that under this assumption there is a model $M$ of $\text{PV}_1$ that contains a nonstandard number $m$ which has no prime factorization.</description>

      <title>Diophantine Equations over $\mathbb Z$: Universal Bounds and Parallel Formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores multiple closely related themes: bounding the complexity of Diophantine equations over the integers and developing mathematical proofs in parallel with formal theorem provers.
  Hilbert's Tenth Problem (H10) asks about the decidability of Diophantine equations and has been answered negatively by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich. It is natural to ask for which subclasses of Diophantine equations H10 remains undecidable. Such subclasses can be defined in terms of universal pairs: bounds on the number of variables $\nu$ and degree $\delta$ such that all Diophantine equations can be rewritten in at most this complexity. Our work develops explicit universal pairs $(\nu, \delta)$ for integer unknowns, achieving new bounds that cannot be obtained by naive translations from known results over $\mathbb N$.
  In parallel, we have conducted a formal verification of our results using the proof assistant Isabelle. While formal proof verification has traditionally been applied a posteriori to known results, this project integrates formalization into the discovery and development process. In a final section, we describe key insights gained from this unusual approach and its implications for mathematical practice. Our work contributes both to the study of Diophantine equations and to the broader question of how mathematics is conducted in the 21st century.</description>
