      <title>Interpretation of recently discovered single bottom baryons in the relativistic flux tube model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following recent experimental progress in the study of bottom baryons, we systematically calculate the mass spectra of $\Lambda_{b}$, $\Xi_{b}$, $\Sigma_{b}$, $\Xi_{b}^{'}$, and $\Omega_{b}$ baryons with a quark-diquark picture in the framework of a relativistic flux tube model with spin-dependent interactions in the j-j coupling scheme. Furthermore, we calculate the strong decay width of bottom baryons decaying into a bottom baryon and a light pseudoscalar meson. A good agreement is found between the calculated masses and the experimentally available masses of singly bottom baryons. %We interpret $\Sigma_{b}(6097)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state, $\Xi_{b}(6100)$ as $1P(1/2^{-})$ state of $\Xi_{b}$ baryon, $\Xi_{b}(6227)$ as a $1P(1/2^{-})$ or $1P(3/2^{-})$ state of $\Xi_{b}'$ baryon, $\Xi_{b}(6327)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state of $\Xi_{b}'$ baryon, and $\Xi_{b}(6333)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state of $\Xi_{b}'$ baryon. By analysing both mass spectra and strong decay widths, we interpret $\Sigma_{b}(6097)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state and $\Xi_{b}(6100)$ as a $1P(1/2^{-})$ state of $\Xi_{b}$ baryon. The $\Xi_{b}(6227)$ is identified to be an orbital excitation $1P$ of the $\Xi_{b}^{'}$ baryon with $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$. Further, we determine $\Xi_{b}(6327)$ and $\Xi_{b}(6333)$ as a $1P(3/2^{-})$ state and $1P(5/2^{-})$ state, respectively, of $\Xi_{b}^{'}$ baryon. From the obtained mass spectra, we construct the Regge trajectories in the $(J,M^{2})$ plane, which are found to be essentially linear, parallel, and equidistant. Our predictions for higher orbital and radial excited states can help experimentalists identify missing excited states of singly bottom baryons.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Top Quark Polarimetry with ParticleNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision studies for top quark physics are a cornerstone of the Large Hadron Collider program. Polarization, probed through decay kinematics, provides a unique tool to scrutinize the top quark across its various production modes and to explore potential new physics effects. However, the top quark most often decays hadronically, for which unambiguous identification of its decay products sensitive to top quark polarization is not possible. In this Letter, we introduce a jet flavor tagging method to significantly improve spin analyzing power in hadronic decays, going beyond exclusive kinematic information employed in previous studies. We provide parametric estimates of the improvement from flavor tagging with any set of measured observables and demonstrate this in practice on simulated data using a Graph Neural Network (GNN). We find that the spin analyzing power in hadronic decays can improve by approximately 20% (40%) compared to the kinematic approach, assuming an efficiency of 0.5 (0.2) for the network.</description>

      <title>ALP leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel realisation of leptogenesis that relies on the out-of-equilibrium decay of an axion-like particle (ALP) into right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHNs) in the early Universe. With respect to standard thermal leptogenesis, our mechanism lowers by two orders of magnitude the RHN mass, or the tuning in the RHN mass splittings, needed to reproduce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino masses. We find that ALP leptogenesis requires $m_a &gt; 10^{4}$ GeV and $f_a &gt; 10^{11}$ GeV for the ALP mass and decay constant, and predicts an early period of matter domination induced by the ALP in parts of its parameter space. We finally provide a viable supersymmetric realisation of ALP leptogenesis where the ALP is the $R$-axion, which accommodates GeV gravitino dark matter and predicts RHN below 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Raining on DUNE and Other Large Volume Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection is a powerful means of searching for particle physics evidence of dark matter (DM) heavier than about a GeV with $\mathcal O(kiloton)$ volume, low-threshold detectors. In many scenarios, some fraction of the DM may be boosted to large velocities enhancing and generally modifying possible detection signatures. We investigate the scenario where 100% of the DM is boosted at the Earth due to new attractive long-range forces. This leads to two main improvements in detection capabilities: 1) the large boost allows for detectable signatures of DM well below a GeV at large-volume neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and JUNO, as possible DM detectors, and 2) the flux at the Earth's surface is enhanced by a focusing effect. In addition, the model leads to a significant anisotropy in the signal with the DM flowing dominantly vertically at the Earth's surface instead of the typical approximately isotropic DM signal. We develop the theory behind this model and also calculate realistic constraints using a detailed GENIE simulation of the signal inside detectors.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation of Nonrelativistic Scalars: Applications to Pion and Axion Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In studying secondary gamma-ray emissions from Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), the production of scalar particles like pions and axion-like particles (ALPs) via Hawking radiation is crucial. While previous analyses assumed relativistic production, asteroid-mass PBHs, relevant to upcoming experiments like AMEGO-X, likely produce pions and ALPs non-relativistically when their masses exceed 10 MeV. To account for mass dependence in Hawking radiation, we revisit the greybody factors for massive scalars from Schwarzschild black holes, revealing significant mass corrections to particle production rates compared to the projected AMEGO-X sensitivity. We highlight the importance of considering non-relativistic $\pi^0$ production in interpreting PBH gamma-ray signals, essential for determining PBH properties. Additionally, we comment on the potential suppression of pion production due to form factor effects when producing extended objects via Hawking radiation. We also provide an example code for calculating the Hawking radiation spectrum of massive scalar particles.</description>

      <title>Axion Relic Pockets -- a theory of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new theory of dark matter based on axion physics and cosmological phase transitions. We show that theories in which a gauge coupling increases through a first-order phase transition naturally result in `axion relic pockets': regions of relic false vacua stabilised by the pressure from a kinematically trapped, hot axion gas. Axion relic pockets provide a viable and highly economical theory of dark matter: the macroscopic properties of the pockets depend only on a single parameter (the phase transition temperature). We describe the formation, evolution and present-day properties of axion relic pockets, and outline how their phenomenology is distinct from existing dark matter paradigms. We briefly discuss how laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can be used to test the theory, and identify gamma-ray observations of magnetised, dark-matter-dense environments as particularly promising.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes in the Randall-Sundrum model with brane-localized curvature terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the scattering amplitudes of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in Randall-Sundrum models with brane-localized curvature terms. We show that the presence of brane-localized curvature interactions modifies the properties of (4D) scalar fluctuations of the metric, resulting in scattering amplitudes of the massive spin-2 KK states which grow as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ instead of ${\cal O}(s)$. We uncover new constraints on the size of the brane-localized curvature interactions based on the consistency of the Sturm-Liouville mode systems of the spin-2 and spin-0 metric fluctuations. We connect the properties of the scattering amplitudes to the diffeomorphism invariance of the compactified KK theory with brane-localized curvature interactions. We verify that the scattering amplitudes involving brane-localized external sources (matter) are diffeomorphism-invariant, but show that those for matter localized at an arbitrary point in the bulk are not. We demonstrate that, in Feynman gauge, the spin-0 Goldstone bosons corresponding to helicity-0 states of the massive spin-2 KK bosons behave as a tower of Galileons, and that it is their interactions that produce the high-energy behavior of the scattering amplitudes. We also outline the correspondence between our results and those in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. In an appendix we discuss the analogous issue in extra-dimensional gauge theory, and show that the presence of a brane-localized gauge kinetic-energy term does not change the high-energy behavior of corresponding KK vector boson scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Resummation of Glauber Phases in Non-Global LHC Observables for Large $N_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Glauber series for non-global jet observables at hadron colliders simultaneously includes the super-leading logarithms alongside an arbitrary number of Glauber phases. Building on the formalism of arXiv:2405.05305, it is shown that the leading terms in this series for large $N_c$ can be resummed in closed form in renormalization-group improved perturbation theory. This remarkable observation suggests that large-$N_c$ methods might also be helpful to study other aspects of non-global logarithms at hadron colliders, and to combine our analytic results with amplitude-level parton showers.</description>

      <title>Electroweak-Charged Dark Matter and SO(10) Unification with Parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider electroweak-charged dark matter in an $SO(10)$ unified theory that solves the strong $CP$ problem via Parity. Electroweak-charged dark matter has a colored $SO(10)$ partner, whose mass should be much above the dark matter mass to avoid cosmological problems arising from the decay of the colored partner. The mass hierarchy can be naturally achieved by an $SO(10)\times CP$ symmetry breaking Higgs that has a missing vacuum expectation value. The mass hierarchy, via quantum corrections to the gauge coupling constants, lowers the unification scale and enhances the proton decay rate. Hyper-Kamiokande will probe the parameter space with precise gauge coupling unification. We derive the range of the top quark mass and the strong coupling constant preferred by radiative Parity breaking by the Higgs Parity mechanism.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analyze the $\bar KN$ interaction in the framework of a constituent quark model. The near-threshold elastic and charge exchange cross sections are evaluated, finding a good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, the possible existence of $\bar KN$ bound states are explored, finding two poles in the isoscalar $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ sector that can be interpreted as the experimental $\Lambda(1405)$ state.</description>

      <title>Early-Career Researchers' Perspective on Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has significantly advanced particle physics and will continue to do so in the context of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program to collect $3000$ fb$^{-1}$ by the end of 2041. The particle physics community worldwide is discussing which future collider could follow in the footsteps of the LHC and uncover yet inaccessible phenomena.
  To foster the discussion on this important topic among the young particle physicist community, the Early-Career Researchers (ECR) panel of the European Committee for Future Colliders (ECFA) has organized the Future Colliders for Early-Career Researchers workshop at CERN in September 2023. This document aims to summarise this event and present the ECR perspective, outline the key questions that came up during the discussions, and explore how ECRs can influence the decision process of future colliders community and beyond.</description>

      <title>First-order Electroweak phase transition at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Electroweak phase transition with the Standard Model effective field theory at finite temperature and finite density. Utilizing the dimensional reduction approach, we construct the tree dimensional thermal effective field theory at finite density and investigate the phase transition dynamics. We evaluate how the results depend on the renormalization scale and the chemical potential. Our results show that, with the tree dimensional thermal effective potential at 2-loop level, we can effectively reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the calculations of the phase transition parameters due to the renormalization scale dependence, and the new physics scale is restricted to be $\Lambda\lesssim (770-800)$ GeV by the baryon number washout avoidance condition. Meanwhile, the presence of the chemical potential would affect the phase transition parameter and make the constraints from the baryon number washout avoidance condition more strict, especially for weaker first-order phase transition scenarios at higher new physics scales.</description>

      <title>Analysis of short range interactions between $u/d$ quarks in the $NN$, $D_{03}$, and $D_{30}$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic mechanism of short range interaction between $u/d$ quarks is still an open and challenging problem. In order to reveal this quark dynamics, we perform a systematic analysis of $NN$, $D_{03}$, and $D_{30}$ systems in the (extended) chiral SU(3) constituent quark models. By comparing results calculated with different models and different parameter sets, the effects of one gluon exchange and vector meson exchange terms are carefully examined. The results indicate that the vector meson exchange interactions dominate the short range interactions between $u/d$ quarks, while the small residual one gluon exchange coupling strength is also allowed.</description>

      <title>Jet quenching for hadron-tagged jets in $pA$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the medium modification factor $I_{pA}$ for 5.02 TeV $p$+Pb collisions. We use the Monte-Carlo Glauber model to determine the parameters of the quark-gluon plasma fireball in $pA$ jet events. Our calculations show that the jet quenching effect for $I_{pA}$ turns out to be rather small. We have found that the theoretical $I_{pA}$ as a function of the underlying event charged multiplicity density, within errors, agrees with data from ALICE for 5.02 TeV $p$+Pb collisions. However, the experimental errors are too large to draw a firm conclusion on the possible presence of jet quenching.</description>

Abstract: We report on the status of the calculation of the massive Wilson coefficients and operator matrix elements for deep-inelastic scatterung to three-loop order. We discuss both the unpolarized and the polarized case, for which all the single-mass and nearly all two-mass contributions have been calculated. Numerical results on the structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ are presented. In the polarized case, we work in the Larin scheme and refer to parton distribution functions in this scheme. Furthermore, results on the three-loop variable flavor number scheme are presented</description>

      <title>Hard Diffraction in Sherpa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete simulation framework for the simulation of jet production in diffractive events at next-to leading order in QCD, matched to the parton shower. We validate the implementation in the SHERPA event generator with data from the H1 and ZEUS experiments for diffractive DIS and diffractive photoproduction. For the latter, we review different models aiming to explain the observed factorisation breaking and we argue that at NLO the direct component must also be suppressed. We provide predictions for diffractive jet production both in DIS and in photoproduction events for the upcoming EIC.</description>

      <title>Dijet photoproduction and transverse-plane geometry in ultra-peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new NLO pQCD predictions for the inclusive photoproduction of dijets in ultra-peripheral (UPC) lead-lead collisions at 5.02 TeV with a realistic impact-parameter dependent effective photon flux obtained through the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile. For the first time in NLO inclusive UPC dijet predictions, we take into account also the modelling of the forward-neutron event class required in the experimental measurements. We show that since the dijet photoproduction at forward rapidities requires an energetic photon in the initial state, this biases the cross section to be dominated by events with relatively small impact parameters between the nuclei, of the order of a few nuclear radii. This leads to a sensitivity to the transverse-plane collision geometry, which we take properly into account by including effects from the finite extent of both the photon-emitting and the target nucleus. We also test the potential sensitivity to the spatial dependence of nuclear parton distribution functions in connection with this finding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize our efforts to create a numerical implementation of the Local Analytical Subtraction Scheme (LASS) for obtaining NNLO QCD predictions in electron-positron collisions. We focus on the regularization of double-real radiation contributions, which are typically the most computationally intensive part of NNLO calculations. We describe the structure of the subtraction terms in LASS and our approach to numerically validate them. Using arbitrary precision arithmetic, we demonstrate the proper convergence of individual subtraction terms, overlap removal terms, and spurious singularity cancellations in various singular limits. We show results for the specific case of three-jet production in $e^+e^-$ collisions. Our results validate the correctness of both the LASS formalism and our numerical implementation, setting the stage for full NNLO calculations using this method.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $(n+1)$ and $n$-parton contributions for computing QCD jet cross sections in the local analytic subtraction scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze and implement the Local Analytic Sector Subtraction (LASS) scheme for handling infrared singularities in next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations in perturbative QCD. We examine the key aspects of the scheme including sector function construction, singular limit parametrization, subtraction counterterm derivation, and integration techniques. As a proof-of-concept, we numerically implement LASS for the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow 3$ jets. In this study we examine the limiting behavior of subtraction terms for real-virtual contribution and explicitly demonstrate the pole cancellation of the double-virtual contribution. Differential cross sections are computed for several event shape observables, showing the stability and efficiency of LASS scheme. This work lays the foundation for developing an automated tool for NNLO QCD calculations using this promising scheme.</description>

      <title>Coherent photo- and electroproduction of charmonia on nuclear targets revisited: Green function formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study for the first time the production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions based on a rigorous Green function formalism. Such formalism allows to incorporate properly formation effects (color transparency), as well as the quantum coherence inherent in higher twist shadowing corrections related to the $|Q \bar{Q}\rangle$ Fock component of the photon. The leading twist gluon shadowing associated with multi-gluon photon fluctuations is also included within the same formalism. The later effect represents the dominant source of shadowing at mid rapidities in the LHC kinematic region, while the reduced effect of quark shadowing leads to a significant modification of differential cross sections $d\sigma/dy$ at forward and/or backwards rapidities. Model calculations for $d\sigma/dy$ are in a good agreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and the LHC. In addition, we also perform predictions for nuclear effects in the electroproduction of charmonia, which can be verified by new data from electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Dark symmetry implication for right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the long-standing issues of neutrino mass and dark matter can be manifestly solved in a dark gauge symmetry $U(1)_D$ that transforms nontrivially only for three right-handed neutrinos $\nu_{1,2,3R}$ -- the counterparts of known left-handed neutrinos. This theory assigns $\nu_{1,2,3R}$ dark charge to be $D=0$, $-1$, and $+1$, respectively, in order for anomaly cancelation. Additionally, it imposes an inert Higgs doublet $\eta$ and two Higgs singlets $\xi,\phi$ with dark charge $D=+1$, $-1$, and $+2$, respectively. That said, the dark symmetry is broken by $\phi$ (by two units) down to a dark parity $P_D=(-1)^D$, for which $\nu_{2,3R}$ and $\eta,\xi$ are odd, whereas all other fields are even due to $D=0$. The lightest of these odd fields is stabilized by $P_D$, responsible for dark matter. Neutrino masses are generated by a scotoseesaw scheme, in which the seesaw part is mediated by $\nu_{1R}$, while the scotogenic part is mediated by $\nu_{2,3R}$, for which the hierarchy of atmospheric and solar neutrino mass splittings is explained.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model Higgs potential is known to be metastable, therefore Higgs Inflation requires an extension in order to stabilise the potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$: $T$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, 2/3)$ and $B$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, -1/3)$. Requiring stability of the finite-temperature effective potential, and assuming $m_{t}$ equals its mean value, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The corresponding absolute stability upper bounds are 4.4 TeV and 29 TeV. Small upper bounds are obtained for $B$ quarks. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger constraint on $m_{Q}$, with the $T$ quark upper bound equal to 2.4 TeV for $n_{Q} = 2$ and 13 TeV for $n_{Q} = 3$. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility to reanalyse data taken by the HERA experiments offers the chance to study modern QCD jet and event-shape observables in deep-inelastic scattering production. In this contribution we present resummed and matched predictions for the groomed invariant-mass event shape in neutral-current DIS including the effect of grooming the hadronic final state using the soft-drop technique. Non-perturbative corrections from hadronisation are taken into account through parton-to-hadron level transfer matrices extracted from dedicated Monte Carlo simulations with SHERPA, including uncertainties extracted from replica tunes to data from the HERA experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos with refractive masses and the DESI BAO results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to interactions with dark matter, neutrinos can acquire refractive masses which explain the data from oscillation experiments. We study the effects of relic neutrinos with refractive masses on structure formation in the Universe. In the model with a light fermionic mediator, above the resonance energy, $E_R$, associated with the mass of the mediator, refractive masses have all the properties identical to the usual vacuum masses. Below the resonance, refractive masses decrease with neutrino energy, however, they cannot be used in the same way as usual masses. We study the dispersion relations and group velocities of such neutrinos and their dependence on redshift. We show that in the epoch of structure formation, relic neutrinos were ultrarelativistic and essentially massless particles for $E_R = (10 - 10^5)\,$eV. This allows to reconcile the values of masses extracted from oscillation experiments with the stringent bounds on sum of neutrino masses from cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Mixing effects on spectroscopy and partonic observables of mesons with logarithmic confining potential in a light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the variational principle, we systematically investigate the mass spectra and wave functions of both $1S$ and $2S$ state heavy pseudoscalar $(P)$ and vector $(V)$ mesons within the light-front quark model. This approach incorporates a Coulomb plus logarithmic confinement potential to accurately describe the constituent quark and antiquark dynamics. Additionally, spin hyperfine interactions are introduced perturbatively to compute the masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons. The present analyses of the $1S$ and $2S$ states require the consideration of mixing between them to account for empirical constraints. These constraints include the mass gap $\Delta M_{P} &gt; \Delta M_{V}$, where $\Delta M_{P(V)} = M^{2S}_{P(V)} - M^{1S}_{P(V)}$ and the hierarchy of the decay constants $f_{1S} &gt; f_{2S}$. We find the optimal value of the mixing angle to be $\theta = 18^{\circ}$, significantly enhancing the consistency between our spectroscopic predictions and the experimental data compiled by the Particle Data Group (PDG). Furthermore, based on the predicted mass, the newly observed resonance $B_J(5840)$ could be assigned as a $2^1S_0$ state in the $B$ meson family. The study also reports various pertinent observables, including twist-2 distribution amplitudes, electromagnetic form factors, charge radii, $\xi$ moments, and transition form factors which are found to be consistent with both available lattice simulations and experimental data. In addition, our predicted branching ratios for the channels of $B^+ \rightarrow \tau^+ \nu_{\tau}$ as well as rare decays of $B^0$ and $B_s^0$ appear in accordance with experimental data.</description>

      <title>On quark-lepton mixing and the leptonic CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of a Grand Unified Theory framework, connecting the values of the mixing parameters in the quark and lepton sector is a difficult task, unless one introduces ad-hoc relations among the matrices that diagonalize such different kinds of fermions. In this paper, we discuss in detail the possibility that the PMNS matrix is given by the product U_{PMNS}=V^\ast_{CKM} T^\ast where T comes from the diagonalization of a see-saw like mass matrix that can be of a Bimaximal (BM), Tri-Bimaximal (TBM) and Golden Ratio (GR) form, and identify the leading corrections to such patterns that allow a good fit to the leptonic mixing matrix as well as to the CP phase. We also show that the modified versions of BM, TBM and GR can easily accommodate the solar and atmospheric mass differences</description>

      <title>Polyadic supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a polyadic analog of supersymmetry by considering the polyadization procedure (proposed by the author) applied to the toy model of one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The supercharges are generalized to polyadic ones using the $n$-ary sigma matrices defined in earlier work. In this way, polyadic analogs of supercharges and Hamiltonians take the cyclic shift block matrix form, and they can describe multidegenerated quantum states in a way that is different from the $N$-extended and multigraded SQM. While constructing the corresponding supersymmetry as an $n$-ary Lie superalgebra ($n$ is the arity of the initial associative multiplication), we have found new brackets with a reduced arity of $2\leq m&lt;n$ and a related series of $m$-ary superalgebras (which is impossible for binary superalgebras). In the case of even reduced arity $m$ we obtain a tower of higher order (as differential operators) even Hamiltonians, while for $m$ odd we get a tower of higher order odd supercharges, and the corresponding algebra consists of the odd sector only.</description>

      <title>Spectral evolution of RX J0440.9+4431 during the 2022-2023 giant outburst observed with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022-2023, the X-ray pulsar RX J0440.9+4431 underwent a Type II giant outburst, reaching a peak luminosity L_x ~ 4*10^{37} erg/s. In this work, we utilize Insight-HXMT data to analyze the spectral evolution of RX J0440.9+4431 during the giant outburst. By analysing the variation of the X-ray spectrum during the outburst using standard phenomenological models, we find that as the luminosity approaches the critical luminosity, the spectrum became flatter, with the photon enhancement predominantly concentrated around ~ 2 keV and 20-40 keV. The same behavior has also been noted in Type II outbursts from other sources. While the phenomenological models provide good fits to the spectrum, this approach is sometimes difficult to translate into direct insight into the details of the fundamental accretion physics. Hence we have also analyzed spectra obtained during high and low phases of the outburst using a new, recently-developed physics-based theoretical model, which allows us to study the variations of physical parameters such as temperature, density, and magnetic field strength during the outburst. Application of the theoretical model reveals that the observed spectrum is dominated by Comptonized bremsstrahlung emission emitted from the column walls in both the high and low states. We show that the spectral flattening observed at high luminosities results from a decrease in the electron temperature, combined with a compactification of the emission zone, which reduces the efficiency of bulk Comptonization. We also demonstrate that when the source is at maximum luminosity, the spectrum tends to harden around the peak of the pulse profile, and we discuss possible theoretical explanations for this behavior. We argue that the totality of the behavior in this source can be explained if the accretion column is in a quasi-critical state when at the maximum luminosity observed during the outburst.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic instability in rapidly accreting supermassive stars in the presence of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) via the general-relativistic (GR) instability would provide a natural explanation to the existence of the most extreme quasars. The presence of dark matter in SMSs is thought to potentially impact their properties, in particular their mass at collapse. Dark matter might be made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that can be captured by the gravitational potential well of SMSs due to interaction with the baryonic gas. The annihilation of WIMPs can provide fuel to support the star before H-burning ignition, favouring low densities of baryonic gas, long stellar lifetimes and high final masses. Here, we estimate the impact of dark matter on the GR dynamical stability of rapidly accreting SMSs. We add a dark matter term to the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations and apply it to hylotropic structures in order to determine the onset point of the GR instability. We find that, in principle, the dark matter gravitational field can remove completely the GR instability. However, for SMSs fuelled by H-burning, the dark matter densities required to stabilise the star against GR are orders of magnitude above the values that are expected for the dark matter background. On the other hand, for SMSs fuelled by WIMP annihilation, we find that the low densities of baryonic gas inhibit the destabilising GR corrections, which shifts the stability limit by typically an order of magnitude towards higher masses. As long as central temperatures $\lesssim10^7$ K are maintained by WIMP annihilation, the GR instability is reached only for stellar masses $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$. Dark matter can impact the GR dynamical stability of SMSs only in the case of energetically significant WIMP annihilation. The detection of a SMS with mass $&gt;10^6$ M$_\odot$ in an atomically cooled halo can be interpreted as an evidence of WIMP annihilation in the star's core.</description>

      <title>A central degeneracy induced outer core in fermionic dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several galaxy-scale observations challenge the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm based on cosmological simulations. The cusp-core problem is one of the most outstanding. However, current simulations are unable to consider quantum statistical effects. For a fermionic dark matter halo, a degenerate inner core induces an extended outer core that dominates in gravity in the region relevant for rotation curve observation. We study the properties of this outer core and show that its density and radius are correlated. The prediction remarkably agrees with the measured scaling relation in both the slope and the magnitude. Such consistency suggests that the observed cored profiles do not contradict massive dark matter but indicate its fermionic nature.</description>

      <title>Extended Uncertainty Principle: A Deeper Insight into the Hubble Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, known as the LambdaCDM model, has been successful in many respects, but it has some significant discrepancies, some of which have not been resolved yet. In measuring the Hubble-Lematre parameter, there is an apparent discrepancy which is known as the Hubble tension, defined as differences in values of this parameter measured by the Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) data (a model-independent method) and by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation maps (a model-dependent method). Although many potential solutions have been proposed, the issue still remains unresolved. Recently, it was observed that the Hubble tension can be due to the concept of uncertainty in measuring cosmological parameters at large distance scales through applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) in cosmological setups. Extending this pioneering idea, in the present study we plan to incorporate the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) containing a minimal fundamental measurable momentum (or equivalently, a maximal fundamental measurable length) as a candidate setup for describing large-scale effects of Quantum Gravity (QG) to address the Hubble tension and constrain the EUP length scale. In this regard, by finding a relevant formula for the effective photon rest mass in terms of the present-time value of the Hubble-Lematre parameter, we see that discrepancies in the value of photon rest mass associated with the Hubble-Lematre parameter values estimated from model-independent and model-dependent methods perhaps is the cause of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>PT symmetric fermionic particle oscillations in even dimensional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel class of quantum mechanical particle oscillations in both relativistic and nonrelativistic systems based on $PT$ symmetry and $T^2=-1$, where $P$ is parity and $T$ is time reversal. The Hamiltonians are chosen at the outset to be self-adjoint with respect to a PT inner product. The quantum mechanical time evolution is based on a modified CPT inner product constructed in terms of a suitable C operator. The resulting quantum mechanical evolution is shown to be unitary and probability is conserved by the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Conversations in the dark: cross-correlating birefringence and LSS to constrain axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unveiling the dark sector of the Universe is one of the leading efforts in theoretical physics. Among the many models proposed, axions and axion-like particles stand out due to their solid theoretical foundation, capacity to contribute significantly to both dark matter and dark energy, and potential to address the small-scale crisis of $\Lambda$CDM. Moreover, these pseudo-scalar fields couple to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons parity-violating term, leading to a rotation of the plane of linearly polarized waves, namely cosmic birefringence. We explore the impact of the axion-parameters on anisotropic birefringence and study, for the first time, its cross-correlation with the spatial distribution of galaxies, focusing on ultralight axions with masses $10^{-33}\,{\rm eV}\le m_\phi\le10^{-28}\,{\rm eV}$. Through this novel approach, we investigate the axion-parameter space in the mass $m_\phi$ and initial misalignment angle $\theta_i$, within the framework of early dark energy models, and constrain the axion-photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma}$ required to achieve unity in the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying cross-correlation, computed with the instrument specifications of Euclid and forthcoming CMB-polarization data. Our findings reveal that for masses below $10^{-32}\,{\rm eV}$ and initial misalignment angles greater in absolute value than $\pi/4$, the signal-to-noise ratio not only exceeds unity but also surpasses that achievable from the auto-correlation of birefringence alone (up to a factor 7), highlighting the informative potential of this new probe. Additionally, given the late-time evolution of these low-mass axions, the signal stems from the epoch of reionization, providing an excellent tool to single out the birefringence generated during this period.</description>

      <title>Vortex Rings in Event-by-Event Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present event-by-event simulations for central asymmetric light+heavy and Au+Au collisions to investigate the formation and evolution of vortex-ring structures in the longitudinal flow velocity profile. The production-plane polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons, defined w.r.t. the $\Lambda$ momentum and the beam, can track the "vortex-ring" feature in the event, a characteristic vortical structure generated by longitudinal flow gradients. We make comprehensive model predictions for the rapidity-dependent vortex-ring observables for different collision system sizes at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ and 72 GeV. Our predictions at the latter energy can be explored in the future LHCb fixed-target experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>New insight into the exotic states strongly coupled with the $D\bar{D}^*$ from the $T^+_{cc}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the internal structure of the open- and hidden-charmed ($DD^*$/$\bar DD^*$) molecules in the unified framework. We first fit the experimental lineshape of the $T^+_{cc}$ state and extract the $DD^*$ interaction, from which the $T^+_{cc}$ is assumed to arise solely. Then we obtain the $D\bar{D}^*$ interaction by charge conjugation. Our results show that the $D\bar{D}^*$ interaction is attractive but insufficient to form $X(3872)$ as a bound state. Instead, its formation requires the crucial involvement of the coupled channel effect between the $D\bar D^*$ and $c\bar c$ components, although the $c\bar c$ accounts for approximately $1\%$ only. Besides $X(3872)$, we have obtained a higher-energy state around $3957.9$ MeV with a width of $16.7$ MeV, which may be a potential candidate for the $X(3940)$. In $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ sector, we have found two states related to the iso-scalar $\tilde X(3872)$ and $h_c(2P)$, respectively. Our combined study provides valuable insights into the nature of these $DD^*$/$D\bar D^*$ exotic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dynamical scoto-seesaw mechanism using a gauged $B-L$ symmetry. Dark matter is reconciled with neutrino mass generation, in such a way that the atmospheric scale arises \textit{a la seesaw}, while the solar scale is \textit{scotogenic}, arising radiatively from the exchange of ``dark'' states. This way we ``explain'' the solar-to-atmospheric scale ratio. The TeV-scale seesaw mediator and the two dark fermions carry different $B-L$ charges. Dark matter stability follows from the residual matter parity that survives $B-L$ breaking. Besides having collider tests, the model implies sizeable charged lepton flavour violating (cLFV) phenomena, including Goldstone boson emission processes.</description>

      <title>The Anatomy of $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excellent experimental prospects to measure the invisible mass spectrum of the $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ decay opens a new path to test generalised quark--neutrino interactions with flavour changing $s\to d$ transitions and as such to novel probes of Physics beyond the Standard Model. Such signals can be a consequence of new lepton-number violating or lepton-number conserving interactions, with their interpretations depending on the Majorana versus Dirac nature of the neutrinos. Furthermore, the possible existence of new massive sterile neutrinos can be tested via their distinctive imprints in the invariant mass spectrum. Within the model-independent framework of the weak effective theory at dimension-six, we study the New Physics effects of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos on the differential distribution of $K^+\rightarrow \pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ allowing for lepton-number violating interactions and potential new sterile neutrinos. We determine the current and expected future sensitivity on the corresponding $\Delta S=1$ neutral-current Wilson coefficients using the distribution measured by the NA62 collaboration and accounting for expected improvements based on the HIKE experiment. We present single-operator fits and also determine correlations among different type of operators. Even though we focus on $s\to d\nu\nu$ transitions, the operator bases for Majorana and Dirac and the classification of lepton-number-violating/conserving interactions is applicable also for the study of $b\to s/d\nu\nu$ and $c\to u\nu\nu$ transitions relevant in current phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use open charm production to estimate how far we can see back in time in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions. We analyze the transverse momentum distributions of the identified D mesons from pp, p--Pb and A--A collisions at the ALICE and STAR experiments covering the energy range from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$~GeV up to 7~TeV. Within a non-extensive statistical framework, the common Tsallis parameters for D mesons represent higher temperature and more degrees of freedom than that of light-flavour hadrons. Assuming Bjorken-expansion, the production of D mesons corresponds to a significantly earlier proper time, $\tau_{\rm D} = (0.18 \pm 0.06) \tau_{\rm LF}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flavor deconstruction refers to ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model where the gauge group is split into multiple factors under which fermions transform non-universally. We propose a mechanism for charging same-family fermions into different factors of a deconstructed gauge theory in a way that gauge anomalies are avoided. The mechanism relies in the inclusion of a strongly-coupled sector, responsible of both anomaly cancellation and the breaking of the non-universal gauge symmetry. As an application, we propose different flavor deconstructions of the Standard Model that, instead of complete families, uniquely identify specific third-family fermions. All these deconstructions allow for a new physics scale that can be as low as few TeV and provide an excellent starting point for the explanation of the Standard Model flavor hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Classifier Surrogates: Sharing AI-based Searches with the World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, neural network-based classification has been used to improve data analysis at collider experiments. While this strategy proves to be hugely successful, the underlying models are not commonly shared with the public and rely on experiment-internal data as well as full detector simulations. We show a concrete implementation of a newly proposed strategy, so-called Classifier Surrogates, to be trained inside the experiments, that only utilise publicly accessible features and truth information. These surrogates approximate the original classifier distribution, and can be shared with the public. Subsequently, such a model can be evaluated by sampling the classification output from high-level information without requiring a sophisticated detector simulation. Technically, we show that Continuous Normalizing Flows are a suitable generative architecture that can be efficiently trained to sample classification results using Conditional Flow Matching. We further demonstrate that these models can be easily extended by Bayesian uncertainties to indicate their degree of validity when confronted with unknown inputs by the user. For a concrete example of tagging jets from hadronically decaying top quarks, we demonstrate the application of flows in combination with uncertainty estimation through either inference of a mean-field Gaussian weight posterior, or Monte Carlo sampling network weights.</description>

Abstract: We argue that measurements of forward neutrons from nuclear breakup in inclusive high energy photon-nucleus ($\gamma A$) scattering provide a novel way to study small-$x$ dynamics of QCD in heavy-ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs). Using models for hadronic fluctuations of the real photon and neutron emission in nuclear fragmentation, we calculate the distribution over the number of evaporation neutrons produced in $\gamma Pb$ collisions at the LHC. We show that it is correlated with the number of wounded nucleons (inelastic collisions) and, hence, can constrain the mechanism of nuclear shadowing and its $x$ dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present simple effective theory of quark masses, mixing and CP violation with level $N=3$ ($A_4$) modular symmetry, which provides solution to the strong CP problem without the need for an axion. The vanishing of the strong CP-violating phase $\bar \theta$ is ensured by assuming CP to be a fundamental symmetry of the Lagrangian of the theory. The CP symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the modulus $\tau$. This provides the requisite large value of the CKM CP-violating phase while the strong CP phase $\bar \theta$ remains zero or is tiny. Within the considered framework we discuss phenomenologically viable quark mass matrices with three types of texture zeros, which are realized by assigning both the left-handed and right-handed quark fields to $A_4$ singlets ${\bf 1}$, ${\bf 1'}$ and ${\bf 1''}$ with appropriate weights. The VEV of $\tau$ is restricted to reproduce the observed CKM parameters. We discuss cases in which the modulus VEV is close to the fixed points $i$, $\omega$ and $i\infty$. In particular, we focus on the VEV of $\tau$, which gives the absolute minima of the supergravity-motivated modular- and CP-invariant potentials for the modulus $\tau$, so called, modulus stabilisation. We present a successful model, which is consistent with the modulus stabilisation close to $\tau=\omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a general framework for the evaluation of the gluonic form factors in light hadrons at low momentum transfer, in the QCD instanton vacuum. At medium resolution of the order of the inverse mean instanton size, the glue is mostly localized in single or pair of pseudoparticles, and globally constrained by the fluctuations of their topological charges. These pseudoparticles trap light quarks, giving rise to emerging multiflavor 't Hooft interactions. We explicitly evaluate the gluonic scalar, pseudoscalar, energy-momentum tensor (EMT), and the leading C-odd and C-even three gluons hadronic form factors, at next to leading order (NLO) in the instanton density, including molecular clusters of like and unlike instantons. We use the results for the EMT to address the contribution of the gluons in Ji$^\prime$s mass and spin sum rules, at low resolution. When evolved, our results for the mass and spin composition of the nucleon, are shown to be in good agreement with the recently reported lattice results at higher resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a Bayesian methodology for the solution of the inverse problem underlying the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs). In our approach, Gaussian Processes (GPs) are used to model the PDF prior, while Bayes theorem is used in order to determine the posterior distribution of the PDFs given a set of data. We discuss the general formalism, the Bayesian inference at the level of both parameters and hyperparameters, and the simplifications which occur when the observable entering the analysis is linear in the PDF. We benchmark the new methodology in two simple examples for the determination of a single PDF flavor from a set of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) data and from a set of equal-time correlators computed using lattice QCD. We discuss our results, showing how the proposed methodology allows for a well-defined statistical interpretation of the different sources of errors entering the PDF uncertainty, and how results can be validated a posteriori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) describes the long distance behavior of certain confining, near-conformal gauge theories that have been studied via lattice computation. Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), emerging from the breaking of approximate, continuous, internal symmetries, are coupled to an additional scalar particle, the dilaton, arising from the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This effective theory has been employed to study possible extensions of the standard model. In this paper, we propose a complementary role for dEFT, as a description of the dark matter of the universe, with the pNGBs identified as the dark-matter particles. We show that this theory provides a natural implementation of the "forbidden" dark matter mechanism, and we identify regions of parameter space for which the thermal history of dEFT yields the measured dark matter relic density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) are absent in the Standard Model (SM) and at the dimension-6 level in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), arising first from dimension-8 operators. As such, they provide a unique window for probing new physics beyond the SM. These dimension-8 operators can be mapped to nTGC form factors whose structure is consistent with the spontaneously-broken electroweak gauge symmetry of the SM. In this work, we study the probes of nTGCs in the reaction $e^+e^-\to Z\gamma$ with $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-\,(\ell =e,\mu)$ at an $e^+e^-$ collider. We perform a detector-level simulation and analysis of this reaction at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) with collision energy $\sqrt{s} = 240$ GeV and an integrated luminosity of 20 ab$^{-1}$. We present the sensitivity limits on probing the new physics scales of dimension-8 nTGC operators via measurements of the corresponding nTGC form factors.</description>

  The decays $\psi(3686) \to \Lambda +\bar \Lambda$ and $\Xi^0 +\bar \Xi^0$ show the same violation but with less significance. The decay $\psi(3686) \to \Omega^- + \bar \Omega^+$ displays entanglement. These results firmly establish the presence of entanglement and quantum non-separability at high energies, in a setting with particles of different spins and interacting through electroweak and strong interactions. In addition, the relatively long lifetime of some of the strange baryons produced in the decays provides a natural probe to test whether quantum spin correlations remain after the particles have interacted with the beam pipe and the first few layers of the detector.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, can probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis in a distinctive way.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we review the application of modern machine-learning (ML) techniques to boost the search for processes involving the top quarks at the LHC. We revisit the formalism of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Attention Mechanisms. Based on recent studies, we explore their applications in designing improved top taggers, top reconstruction, and event classification tasks. We also examine the ML-based likelihood-free inference approach and generative unfolding models, focusing on their applications to scenarios involving top quarks.</description>

      <title>Bounds to strong gravity from electron-positron annihilations near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss bounds to strong gravity arising from annihilation of electron and positrons and the corresponding enhancement of the cross section for the production of massive particles. Two complementary examples are discussed, the case of the $e^+e^- \to W^+ W^-$ processes, with maximum mass and short lifetime for the particle pairs in the final state, and the case of electron positron annihilation into heavier charged lepton pairs, $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to \tau^+ \tau^-$. These bounds may be improved by the next generation of electron-positron colliders, and are complementary to bounds arising from direct graviton searches.</description>

      <title>SKA sensitivity for possible radio emission from dark matter in Omega Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14117v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Omega Centauri, the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way, is believed to be the remains of a dwarf galaxy's core. Giving its potential abundance of dark matter (DM), it is an attractive target for investigating the nature of this elusive substance in our local environment. Our study demonstrates that by observing Omega Centauri with the SKA for 1000 hours, we can detect synchrotron radio or Inverse Compton (IC) emissions from the DM annihilation products. It enables us to constrain the cross-section of DM annihilation down to $\sim {\rm 10^{-30}~cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for DM mass from several $\rm{GeV}$ to $\rm{100~GeV}$, which is much stronger compared with other observations. Additionally, we explore the axion, another well-motivated DM candidate, and provide stimulated decay calculations. It turns out that the sensitivity can reach $g_{\rm{a\gamma\gamma}} \sim 10^{-10} ~\rm{GeV^{-1}}$ for $2\times 10^{-7} ~\rm{eV} &lt; m_a &lt; 2\times 10^{-4} ~\rm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Arrow of Time in Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that time's arrow is naturally induced by quantum mechanical evolution, whenever the systems have a very large number ${\cal N}$ of non-degenerate states and a Hamiltonian bounded from below. When ${\cal N}$ is finite, the arrow is imperfect, since evolution can resurrect past states. In the limit ${\cal N} \rightarrow \infty$ the arrow is fixed by the "tooth of time": the decay of excited states induced by {\it spontaneous emission} to the ground state, mediated by interactions and a large number of decay products which carry energy and information to infinity. This applies to individual isolated atoms, and does not require a coupling to a separate large heath bath.</description>

      <title>Mirror QCD phase transition as the origin of the nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently provided strong evidence for a nHz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). Here we investigate the implications of a first-order phase transition occurring within the early universe's dark quantum chromodynamics (dQCD) epoch, specifically within the framework of the mirror twin Higgs dark sector model. Our analysis indicates a distinguishable SGWB signal originating from this phase transition, which can explain the measurements obtained by PTAs. Remarkably, a significant portion of the parameter space for the SGWB signal also effectively resolves the existing tensions in both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ measurements in Cosmology. This intriguing correlation suggests a possible common origin of these three phenomena for $0.2 &lt; \Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0.5$, where the mirror dark matter component constitutes about $30\%$ of the total dark matter abundance. Next generation CMB experiment such as CMB-S4 is able to test this parameter region.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference for stochastic gravitational wave background data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of space- and ground-based facilities promise to reveal an entirely new picture of the gravitational wave sky: thousands of galactic and extragalactic binary signals, as well as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) of unresolved astrophysical and possibly cosmological signals. These will need to be disentangled to achieve the scientific goals of experiments such as LISA, Einstein Telescope, or Cosmic Explorer. We focus on one particular aspect of this challenge: reconstructing an SGWB from (mock) LISA data. We demonstrate that simulation-based inference (SBI) - specifically truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE) - is a promising avenue to overcome some of the technical difficulties and compromises necessary when applying more traditional methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). To highlight this, we show that we can reproduce results from traditional methods both for a template-based and agnostic search for an SGWB. Moreover, as a demonstration of the rich potential of SBI, we consider the injection of a population of low signal-to-noise ratio supermassive black hole transient signals into the data. TMNRE can implicitly marginalize over this complicated parameter space, enabling us to directly and accurately reconstruct the stochastic (and instrumental noise) contributions. We publicly release our TMNRE implementation in the form of the code saqqara.</description>

      <title>Simulations of galaxy cluster mergers with velocity-dependent, rare and frequent self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) has been proposed to solve small-scale problems in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In previous work, constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter have been derived assuming that the self-interaction cross-section is independent of velocity. However, a velocity-dependent cross-section is more natural in most theories of SIDM. Using idealized $N$-body simulations without baryons, we study merging clusters with velocity-dependent SIDM. In addition to the usual rare scattering in the isotropic limit, we also simulate these systems with anisotropic, small-angle (frequent) scatterings. We find that the collision-less brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) has an offset from the DM peak that grows at later stages. Finally, we also extend the existing upper bounds on the velocity-independent, isotropic self-interaction cross-section to the parameter space of rare and frequent velocity-dependent self-interactions by studying the central densities of dark matter-only isolated haloes. For these upper-bound parameters, the DM-BCG offsets just after the first pericentre in the dark matter-only simulations are found to be $\leq$ 10 kpc. On the other hand, because of BCG oscillations, we speculate that the distribution of BCG offsets in a relaxed cluster is a statistically viable probe. Therefore, this motivates further studies of BCG off-centring in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Experimental search for invisible dark matter axions around 22 {\mu}eV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The axion has emerged as the most attractive solution to two fundamental questions in modern physics related to the charge-parity invariance in strong interactions and the invisible matter component of our universe. Over the past decade, there have been many theoretical efforts to constrain the axion mass based on various cosmological assumptions. Interestingly, different approaches from independent groups produce good overlap between 20 and 30 {\mu}eV. We performed an experimental search to probe the presence of dark matter axions within this particular mass region. The experiment utilized a multi-cell cavity haloscope embedded in a 12 T magnetic field to seek for microwave signals induced by the axion-photon coupling. The results ruled out the KSVZ axions as dark matter over a mass range between 21.86 and 22.00 {\mu}eV at a 90% confidence level. This represents a sensitive experimental search guided by specific theoretical predictions</description>

      <title>Realisation of the ultra-slow roll phase in Galileon inflation and PBH overproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the explicit realisation of the ultra-slow roll phase in the framework of the effective field theory of single-field Galileon inflation. The pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration hints at the scalar-induced gravity waves (SIGW) from the early universe as an explanation for the origin of the observed signal, which, however, leads to an enhancement in the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum giving rise to the overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). In the setup under consideration, we examine the generation of SIGW consistent with PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) data, in addition to which we also consider the impact from QCD crossover at the nHz frequencies and address the PBH overproduction issue assuming linear approximations for the over-density without incorporating non-Gaussian effects from the comoving curvature perturbation. The framework is shown to give rise to SIGWs well consistent with the PTA signal with comfortable PBH abundance, $10^{-3} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 1$, of near solar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Contribution to differential $\pi^0$ and $\gamma_\mathrm{dir}$ modification in small systems from color fluctuation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major complication in the search for jet quenching in proton- or deuteron-nucleus collision systems is the presence of physical effects which influence the experimental determination of collision centrality in the presence of a hard process. For example, in the proton color fluctuation picture, protons with a large Bjorken-$x$ ($x \gtrsim 0.1$) parton interact more weakly with the nucleons in the nucleus, leading to a smaller (larger) than expected yield in large (small) activity events. A recent measurement by PHENIX compared the yield of neutral pion and direct photon production in $d$+Au collisions, under the argument that the photon yields correct for such biases, and the difference between the two species is thus attributable to final-state effects (i.e., jet quenching). The main finding suggests a significant degree of jet quenching for hard processes in small systems. In this paper, I argue that the particular photon and pion events selected by PHENIX arise from proton configurations with significantly different Bjorken-$x$ distributions, and thus are subject to different magnitudes of modification in the color fluctuation model. Using the results of a previous global analysis of RHIC and LHC data, I show that potentially all of the pion-to-photon difference in PHENIX data can be described by a proton color fluctuation picture at a quantitative level before any additional physics from final-state effects is required. This finding reconciles the interpretation of the PHENIX measurement with others at RHIC and LHC, which have found no observable evidence for jet quenching in small systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our universe is permeated with interstellar plasma, which prevents propagation of low-frequency electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that two dramatic consequences arise out of such suppression; (i) if plasma permeates the light ring of a black hole, electromagnetic modes are screened entirely from the gravitational-wave signal, changing the black hole spectroscopy paradigm; (ii) if a near vacuum cavity is formed close to a charged black hole, as expected for near equal-mass mergers, ringdown "echoes" are excited. The amplitude of such echoes decays slowly and could thus serve as a silver bullet for plasmas near charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Interactions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA: from Constructive and BCFW to KLT formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the coupling of the gravity supermultiplet (graviton and gravitino) of minimal $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA following a constructive approach. Firstly, we use the master formulae that follows from considering the scaling behavior of the spinor variables under the little group. Secondly, we derive the 4-point couplings using BFCW. Then, we verify these results for the general 3-point interactions that can be derived using the KLT-type relations, i.e., they can be written as the square of the coupling of the gluons and gluinos. Finally, we consider SUGRA Compton effect for graviton-gravitino. For completeness, we present in the appendix the $\mathcal{N}=1$ Sugra lagrangian in the 2-component Weyl formalism, including the proofs of SUSY and gauge invariance.</description>
