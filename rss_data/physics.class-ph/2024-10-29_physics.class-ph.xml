      <title>Crystal melting influenced by particle cooperativity of the liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a universal relation between the thermal expansion coefficient of glasses $\alpha_g$, their glass-transition temperature Tg, and the so-called fragility index m of the corresponding supercooled liquid state was found to be valid for more than 200 glass formers, namely $\alpha_g/m\propto 1/T_g$ [P. Lunkenheimer et al., Nat. Phys. 19, 694 (2023)]. Here we show that this could also have far-reaching consequences for our understanding of crystal melting. Namely, when considering the empirically founded 2/3-rule, stating that the ratio of Tg and the melting temperature Tm is about 2/3 for almost all materials, for crystals a similar relation, $\alpha_c/m\propto 1/T_m$, should apply. Indeed, we find that the available experimental data are well consistent with such a relation. This implies that the melting of a crystal into an ordinary (non-supercooled) liquid is influenced by the fragility, a property quantifying the non-Arrhenius dynamics in the supercooled-liquid state of the material. We argue that this can be explained by a significant enhancement of the "ideal" (non-cooperative) melting temperature arising from the cooperativity of the particle motion in the liquid state above Tm. Therefore, a reassessment of the currently widely accepted microscopic understanding of crystal melting, still founded on the general ideas that lead to the time-honored Lindemann melting criterion, may be necessary.</description>

      <title>Neural Hamilton: Can A.I. Understand Hamiltonian Mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework based on neural network that reformulates classical mechanics as an operator learning problem. A machine directly maps a potential function to its corresponding trajectory in phase space without solving the Hamilton equations. Most notably, while conventional methods tend to accumulate errors over time through iterative time integration, our approach prevents error propagation. Two newly developed neural network architectures, namely VaRONet and MambONet, are introduced to adapt the Variational LSTM sequence-to-sequence model and leverage the Mamba model for efficient temporal dynamics processing. We tested our approach with various 1D physics problems: harmonic oscillation, double-well potentials, Morse potential, and other potential models outside the training data. Compared to traditional numerical methods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) algorithm, our model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy.

      <title>Electromagnetic field near the common edge of a perfectly conducting wedge and a resistive half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of the electromagnetic field near a common edge of a resistive half-plane and a perfectly conducting wedge is investigated. The possible appearance besides power terms also of logarithmic functions in the field expansions at specific angles between a resistive plane and the sides of the wedge is indicated. It is shown that in the main terms of the electric or magnetic field components perpendicular to the edge, logarithmic functions appear only in two particular cases: when a half-plane forms a straight angle with one of the sides of the conducting wedge, or when the external angle of the conducting wedge is a right one. Otherwise, the main terms of all components have a purely power character and can be determined by the Meixner method. To confirm the efficiency of accounting for the found field distribution law, transversal wave numbers of the dominant mode of a rectangular waveguide with a resistive film in the diagonal plane is calculated.</description>

      <title>The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the values of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between experimental data and numerical approximations of the behavior of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations of the models that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>
