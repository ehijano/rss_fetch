      <title>The variety of complemented lattices where the Sasaki operations form an adjoint pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sasaki projection was introduced as a mapping from the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space onto one of its segments. To use this projection and its dual so-called Sasaki operations were introduced by the second two authors. In a previous paper there are described several classes of lattices, $\lambda$-lattices and semirings where the Sasaki operations form an adjoint pair. In the present paper we prove that the class of complemented lattices with this property forms a variety and we explicitly state its defining identities. Moreover, we prove that this variety V is congruence permutable and regular. Hence every ideal I of some member L of V is a kernel of some congruence on L. Finally, we determine a finite basis of so-called ideal terms and describe the congruence $\Theta_I$ determined by the ideal I.</description>

      <title>Good Scales and Non-Compactness of Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cummings, Foreman, and Magidor investigated the extent to which square principles are compact at singular cardinals. The first author proved that if $\kappa$ is a singular strong limit of uncountable cofinality, all scales on $\kappa$ are good, and $\square^*_\delta$ holds for all $\delta&lt;\kappa$, then $\square_\kappa^*$ holds. In this paper we will present a strongly contrasting result for $\aleph_\omega$. We construct a model in which $\square_{\aleph_n}$ holds for all $n&lt;\omega$, all scales on $\aleph_\omega$ are good, but in which $\square_{\aleph_\omega}^*$ fails and some weak forms of internal approachability for $[H(\aleph_{\omega+1})]^{\aleph_1}$ fail. This requires an extensive analysis of the dominating and approximation properties of a version of Namba forcing. We also prove some supporting results.</description>

      <title>A vector logic for extensional formal semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves a homomorphism between extensional formal semantics and distributional vector space semantics, demonstrating structural compatibility. Formal semantics models meaning as reference, using logical structures to map linguistic expressions to truth conditions, while distributional semantics represents meaning through word vectors derived from contextual usage. By constructing injective mappings that preserve semantic relationships, we show that every semantic function in an extensional model corresponds to a compatible vector space operation. This result respects compositionality and extends to function compositions, constant interpretations, and $n$-ary relations. Rather than pursuing unification, we highlight a mathematical foundation for hybrid cognitive models that integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning and semantics. These findings support multimodal language processing, aligning `meaning as reference' (Frege, Tarski) with `meaning as use' (Wittgenstein, Firth).</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Normal Modal Logics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article initiates the semantic study of distribution-free normal modal logic systems, laying the semantic foundations and anticipating further research in the area. The article explores roughly the same area, though taking a different approach, with a recent article by Bezhanishvili, de Groot, Dmitrieva and Morachini, who studied a distribution-free version of Dunn's Positive Modal Logic (PML). Unlike PML, we consider logics that may drop distribution and which are equipped with both an implication connective and modal operators. We adopt a uniform relational semantics approach, relying on recent results on representation and duality for normal lattice expansions. We prove canonicity and completeness in the relational semantics of the minimal distribution-free normal modal logic, assuming just the K-axiom, as well as of its axiomatic extensions obtained by adding any of the D, T, B, S4 or S5 axioms. Adding distribution can be easily accommodated and, as a side result, we also obtain a new semantic treatment of Intuitionistic Modal Logic.</description>

      <title>Continuity of heights in families and complete intersections in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the variation of heights of cycles in flat families over number fields or, more generally, globally valued fields. To a finite type scheme over a GVF we associate a locally compact Hausdorff space which we refer to as its GVF analytification. For a flat projective family, we prove that the height of fibres is a continuous function on the GVF analytification of the base. As an application, we prove Roberto Gualdi's conjecture on limit heights of complete intersections in toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Sometimes tame, sometimes wild: weak continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuity is one of the most central notions in mathematics, physics, and computer science. An interesting associated topic is decompositions of continuity, where continuity is shown to be equivalent to the combination of two or more weak continuity notions. In this paper, we study the logical properties of basic theorems about weakly continuous functions, like the supremum principle for the unit interval. We establish that most weak continuity notions are as tame as continuity, i.e. the supremum principle can be proved from the relatively weak arithmetical comprehension axiom only. By contrast, for seven 'wild' weak continuity notions, the associated supremum principle yields rather strong axioms, including Feferman's projection principle, full second-order arithmetic, or Kleene's associated quantifier $(\exists^3)$. Working in Kohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics, we also obtain elegant equivalences in various cases and obtain similar results for e.g. Riemann integration. We believe these results to be of interest to mainstream mathematics as they cast new light on the distinction of 'ordinary mathematics' versus 'foundations of mathematics/set theory'.</description>

      <title>The Lattice Problem for Models of $\mathsf{PA}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lattice problem for models of Peano Arithmetic ($\mathsf{PA}$) is to determine which lattices can be represented as lattices of elementary submodels of a model of $\mathsf{PA}$, or, in greater generality, for a given model $\mathcal{M}$, which lattices can be represented as interstructure lattices of elementary submodels $\mathcal{K}$ of an elementary extension $\mathcal{N}$ such that $\mathcal{M} \preccurlyeq \mathcal{K} \preccurlyeq \mathcal{N}$. The problem has been studied for the last 60 years and the results and their proofs show an interesting interplay between the model theory of PA, Ramsey style combinatorics, lattice representation theory, and elementary number theory. We present a survey of the most important results together with a detailed analysis of some special cases to explain and motivate a technique developed by James Schmerl for constructing elementary extensions with prescribed interstructure lattices. The last section is devoted to a discussion of lesser-known results about lattices of elementary submodels of countable recursively saturated models of PA.</description>

      <title>An almost Kurepa Suslin tree with strongly non-saturated square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For uncountable downwards closed subtrees $U$ and $W$ of an $\omega_1$-tree $T$, we say that $U$ and $W$ are strongly almost disjoint if their intersection is a finite union of countable chains. The tree $T$ is strongly non-saturated if there exists a strongly almost disjoint family of $\omega_2$-many uncountable downwards closed subtrees of $T$. In this article we construct a Knaster forcing which adds a Suslin tree together with a family of $\omega_2$-many strongly almost disjoint automorphisms of it (and thus the square of the Suslin tree is strongly non-saturated). To achieve this goal, we introduce a new idea called $\rho$-separation, which is an adaptation to the finite context of the notion of separation which was recently introduced by Stejskalov\'{a} and the first author for the purpose of adding automorphisms of a tree with a forcing with countable conditions.</description>

      <title>Ajtai's theorem for $T^2_2(R)$ and pebble games with backtracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a pebble game extended by backtracking options for one of the two players (called Prover) and reduce the provability of the pigeonhole principle for a generic predicate $R$ in the bounded arithmetic $T^2_2(R)$ to the existence of a particular kind of winning strategy (called oblivious) for Prover in the game. While the unprovability of the said principle in $T^2_2(R)$ is an immediate consequence of a celebrated theorem of Ajtai (which deals with a stronger theory $T_2(R)$), up-to-date no methods working for $T^2_2(R)$ directly (in particular without switching lemma) are known. Although the full analysis of the introduced pebble game is left open, as a first step towards resolving it, we restrict ourselves to a simplified version of the game. In this case, Prover can use only two pebbles and move in an extremely oblivious way. Besides, a series of backtracks can be made only once during a play. Under these assumptions, we show that no strategy of Prover can be winning.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of positive branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, just like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) NL, rather than P or NC1, respectively.
  The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system eLNDT. Our system eLNDT+ is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the 'monotone sequent calculus' MLK is obtained from the usual sequent calculus LK by restricting to negation-free formulas.
  Our main result is that eLNDT+ polynomially simulates eLNDT over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for MLK by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Je\v{r}\'abek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck\'y. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within eLNDT+ by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</description>

      <title>Semantic Foundations of Reductive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of logic has largely been through the 'deductive' paradigm: conclusions are inferred from established premisses. However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</description>
