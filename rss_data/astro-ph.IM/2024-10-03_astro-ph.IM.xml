      <title>GPI 2.0: Exploring The Impact of Different Readout Modes on the Wavefront Sensor's EMCCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is a high contrast imaging instrument that aims to detect and characterize extrasolar planets. GPI is being upgraded to GPI 2.0, with several subsystems receiving a re-design to improve its contrast. To enable observations on fainter targets and increase performance on brighter ones, one of the upgrades is to the adaptive optics system. The current Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS) is being replaced by a pyramid WFS with an low-noise electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD). EMCCDs are detectors capable of counting single photon events at high speed and high sensitivity. In this work, we characterize the performance of the HN\"u 240 EMCCD from N\"uv\"u Cameras, which was custom-built for GPI 2.0. Through our performance evaluation we found that the operating mode of the camera had to be changed from inverted-mode (IMO) to non-inverted mode (NIMO) in order to improve charge diffusion features found in the detector's images. Here, we characterize the EMCCD's noise contributors (readout noise, clock-induced charges, dark current) and linearity tests (EM gain, exposure time) before and after the switch to NIMO.</description>

      <title>The calibrations of DAMPE $\gamma$-ray effective area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a cosmic-ray detector as well as a pair-converting $\gamma$-ray telescope. The effective area, reflecting the geometrical cross-section area, the $\gamma$-ray conversion probability and the photon selection efficiency, is important in the $\gamma$-ray analyses. In the work, we find a significant time variation in the effective area, as large as $\sim -4\%/{\rm yr}$ at 2 GeV for the high-energy trigger. We derive the data-based correction factors to the effective areas and apply corrections to both the effective areas and the exposure maps. The calibrated exposure can be $\sim 12\%$ smaller than the Monte Carlo one on average at 2 GeV. The calibration is further verified using the observation of the Vela pulsar, showing the spectral parameters with the correction are more consistent with those in the Fermi-LAT catalog than the ones without correction. All the corrections are now implemented in the latest version of the DAMPE $\gamma$-ray analysis toolkit DmpST.</description>

      <title>Optimising the Processing and Storage of Radio Astronomy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of radio astronomy telescopes are challenging existing data analysis paradigms, as they have an order of magnitude larger collecting area and bandwidth. The two primary problems encountered when processing this data are the need for storage and that processing is primarily I/O limited. An example of this is the data deluge expected from the SKA-Low Telescope of about 300 PB per year. To remedy these issues, we have demonstrated lossy and lossless compression of data on an existing precursor telescope, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), using MGARD and ADIOS2 libraries. We find data processing is faster by a factor of 7 and give compression ratios from a factor of 7 (lossless) up to 37 (lossy with an absolute error bound of 1e-3). We discuss the effectiveness of lossy MGARD compression and its adherence to the designated error bounds, the trade-off between these error bounds and the corresponding compression ratios, as well as the potential consequences of these I/O and storage improvements on the science quality of the data products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper traces the 37 years of my career dedicated to the development of integral field spectroscopy (IFS), highlighting significant milestones and advancements. This extensive journey encompasses three generations of IFS: the initial prototype TIGER at CFHT, the first generation including OASIS at CFHT and SAURON at WHT, the second generation with MUSE at VLT, and the potential third generation represented by the Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) project. Throughout, I discuss the lessons learned at each stage and provide my perspective on the future of IFS.</description>

      <title>The 2023 Balloon Flight of the ComPair Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ComPair balloon instrument is a prototype gamma-ray telescope that aims to further develop technology for observing the gamma-ray sky in the MeV regime. ComPair combines four detector subsystems to enable parallel Compton scattering and pair-production detection, critical for observing in this energy range. This includes a 10 layer double-sided silicon strip detector tracker, a virtual Frisch grid low energy CZT calorimeter, a high energy CsI calorimeter, and a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence detector. The inaugural balloon flight successfully launched from the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility site in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, in late August 2023, lasting approximately 6.5 hours in duration. In this proceeding, we discuss the development of the ComPair Since balloon payload, the performance during flight, and early results.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics using high precision absorption spectroscopy; continuum placement uncertainties and the fine structure constant in strong gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for variations of fundamental constants require a comprehensive understanding of measurement errors. This paper examines a source of error that is usually overlooked: the impact of continuum placement error. We investigate the problem using a high resolution, high signal to noise spectrum of the white dwarf G191$-$B2B. Narrow photospheric absorption lines allow us to search for new physics in the presence of a gravitational field approximately $10^4$ times that on Earth. Modelling photospheric lines requires knowing the underlying spectral continuum level. We describe the development of a fully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method. Measurements of the fine structure constant are produced using several continuum models. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small systematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines which impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect should therefore be included in the error budgets of future measurements. Our results suggest that continuum placement variations should be investigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements in stars other than white dwarfs. The analysis presented here is based on NiV absorption lines in the photosphere of G191$-$B2B. Curiously, the inferred measurement of the fine structure constant obtained in this paper using NiV (the least negative of our measurements is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = -1.462 \pm 1.121 \times 10^{-5}$) is inconsistent with the most recent previous G191$-$B2B photospheric measurement using FeV ($\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 6.36 \pm 0.35_{stat} \pm 1.84_{sys} \times 10^{-5}$). Given both measurements are derived from the same spectrum, we presume (but in this work are unable to check) that this 3.2$\sigma$ difference results from unknown laboratory wavelength systematics.</description>

      <title>Explanation to the article "On the calibration of ultra-high energy EASs at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed commentary on the energy calibration of the TA experiment described in our paper (arXiv:2404.16948 [astro-ph.HE]). That paper concludes that the TA energy estimation, which is tied to optical measurements, might be incorrect. A response from members of the TA Collaboration (arXiv:2407.12892 [astro-ph.HE]) states that this conclusion is wrong and "stems from a misinterpretation and an incorrect application of the TA energy deposit formula". Here we demonstrate that our formula for energy deposit is not in fact a rescaled modification of the TA equation, but follows from description of the processes occurring during the passage of charged particles through 1.2 cm thick scintillator. Our estimation of the TA detector response implies the correctness of the cosmic ray spectrum derived from readings of surface detectors of the array.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Method for Characterizing 21-cm Power Spectrum Signal Loss from Temporal Filtering of Drift-scanning Visibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A successful detection of the cosmological 21-cm signal from intensity mapping experiments (for example, during the Epoch of Reioinization or Cosmic Dawn) is contingent on the suppression of subtle systematic effects in the data. Some of these systematic effects, with mutual coupling a major concern in interferometric data, manifest with temporal variability distinct from that of the cosmological signal. Fringe-rate filtering -- a time-based Fourier filtering technique -- is a powerful tool for mitigating these effects; however, fringe-rate filters also attenuate the cosmological signal. Analyses that employ fringe-rate filters must therefore be supplemented by careful accounting of the signal loss incurred by the filters. In this paper, we present a generalized formalism for characterizing how the cosmological 21-cm signal is attenuated by linear time-based filters applied to interferometric visibilities from drift-scanning telescopes. Our formalism primarily relies on analytic calculations and therefore has a greatly reduced computational cost relative to traditional Monte Carlo signal loss analyses. We apply our signal loss formalism to a filtering strategy used by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and compare our analytic predictions against signal loss estimates obtained through a Monte Carlo analysis. We find excellent agreement between the analytic predictions and Monte Carlo estimates and therefore conclude that HERA, as well as any other drift-scanning interferometric experiment, should use our signal loss formalism when applying linear, time-based filters to the visibilities.</description>

      <title>All the Little Things in Abell 2744: $&gt;$1000 Gravitationally Lensed Dwarf Galaxies at $z=0-9$ from JWST NIRCam Grism Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies hold the key to crucial frontiers of astrophysics, however, their faintness renders spectroscopy challenging. Here we present the JWST Cycle 2 survey, All the Little Things (ALT, PID 3516), which is designed to seek late-forming Pop III stars and the drivers of reionization at $z\sim6-7$. ALT has acquired the deepest NIRCam grism spectroscopy yet (7-27 hr), at JWST's most sensitive wavelengths (3-4 $\mu$m), covering the powerful lensing cluster Abell 2744. Over the same 30 arcmin$^2$, ALT's ultra-deep F070W+F090W imaging ($\sim$30 mag) enables selection of very faint sources at $z&gt;6$. We demonstrate the success of ALT's novel ``butterfly" mosaic to solve spectral confusion and contamination, and introduce the ``Allegro" method for emission line identification. By collecting spectra for every source in the field of view, ALT has measured precise ($R\sim1600$) redshifts for 1630 sources at $z=0.2-8.5$. This includes one of the largest samples of distant dwarf galaxies: [1015, 475, 50] sources less massive than the SMC, Fornax, and Sculptor with $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&lt;$[8.5, 7.5, 6.5]. We showcase ALT's discovery space with: (i) spatially resolved spectra of lensed clumps in galaxies as faint as $M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-15$; (ii) large-scale clustering -- overdensities at $z$=[2.50, 2.58, 3.97, 4.30, 5.66, 5.77, 6.33] hosting massive galaxies with striking Balmer breaks; (iii) small-scale clustering -- a system of satellites around a Milky Way analog at $z\sim6$; (iv) spectroscopically confirmed multiple images that help constrain the lensing model underlying all science in this legacy field; (v) sensitive star-formation maps based on dust-insensitive tracers such as Pa$\alpha$; (vi) direct spectroscopic discovery of rare sources such as AGN with ionized outflows. These results provide a powerful proof of concept for how grism surveys maximize the potential of strong lensing fields.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of Transition-Edge Sensors with Scanning SQUID Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in understanding the physics of transition-edge sensors (TESs) over the past decade. However, key questions remain, particularly a detailed understanding of the current-dependent resistance of these detectors when biased within their superconducting transition. We use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy (SSM) to image the local diamagnetic response of aluminum-manganese alloy (Al-Mn) transition-edge sensors (TESs) near their critical temperature of approximately 175 mK. By doing so, we gain insights into how the device dimensions influence TES transition width, which in turn affects device operation and informs optimal device design. Our images reveal that the Al-Mn thin film near the niobium (Nb) leads exhibits an excess diamagnetic response at temperatures several milli-Kelvin (mK) higher than the bulk of the film farther from the contacts. A possible origin of this behavior is a longitudinal proximity effect between the Nb and Al-Mn where the TES acts as a weak link between superconducting leads. We discuss how this effect shapes the temperature dependence of the resistance as the spacing between the leads decreases. This work demonstrates that magnetic imaging with SSM is a powerful tool for local characterization of superconducting detectors.</description>

      <title>Study of magnetic reconnection at low-$\beta$ using laser-powered capacitor coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that rapidly converts magnetic energy into some combination of flow energy, thermal energy, and non-thermal energetic particles. Over the past decade, a new experimental platform has been developed to study magnetic reconnection using strong coil currents powered by high power lasers at low plasma beta, typical conditions under which reconnection is energetically important in astrophysics. KJ-class lasers were used to drive parallel currents to reconnect MG-level magnetic fields in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry, similar to the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment or MRX, and thus this platform is named micro-MRX. This presentation summarizes two major findings from micro-MRX: direct measurement of accelerated electrons and observation of ion acoustic waves during anti-parallel reconnection. The angular dependence of the measured electron energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that direct acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work. Furthermore, a sudden onset of ion acoustic bursts has been measured by collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of magnetic reconnection, followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk acceleration. These results demonstrate that the micro-MRX platform offers a novel and unique approach to study magnetic reconnection in the laboratory in addition to the capabilities provided by traditional magnetized plasma experiments such as MRX and the upcoming FLARE (Facility for Laboratory Reconnection experiments). Future approaches to study other particle acceleration mechanisms and ion acoustic waves from magnetic reconnection are also discussed.</description>

      <title>eDIG-CHANGES III: the lagging eDIG revealed by multi-slit spectroscopy of NGC 891</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinematic information of the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) around galaxies provides clues to the origin of the gas. The eDIG-CHANGES project studies the physical and kinematic properties of the eDIG around the CHANG-ES sample of nearby edge-on disk galaxies. We use a novel multi-slit narrow-band spectroscopy technique to obtain the spatial distribution of spectral properties of the ionized gas around NGC 891, which is often regarded as an analog of the Milky Way. We developed specific data reduction procedures for the multi-slit narrow-band spectroscopy data taken with the MDM 2.4m telescope. The data presented in this paper covers the H$\alpha$ and [N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6583\AA emission lines. The eDIG traced by the H$\alpha$ and [N II] lines shows an obvious asymmetric morphology, being brighter in the northeastern part of the galactic disk and extending a few kpc above and below the disk. Global variations in the [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio suggest additional heating mechanisms for the eDIG at large heights beyond photoionization. We also construct position-velocity (PV) diagrams of the eDIG based on our optical multi-slit spectroscopy data and compare them to similar PV diagrams constructed with the H I data. The dynamics of the two gas phases are generally consistent with each other. Modeling the rotation curves at different heights from the galactic mid-plane suggests a vertical negative gradient in turnover radius and maximum rotation velocity, with magnitudes of approximately $3$ kpc kpc$^{-1}$ and $22-25$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. Measured vertical gradients of the rotation curve parameters suggest significant differential rotation of the ionized gas in the halo, or often referred to as the lagging eDIG. Systematic study of the lagging eDIG in our eDIG-CHANGES project, will help us to better understand the dynamics of the ionized gas in the halo.</description>

      <title>BEBOP VI. Enabling the detection of circumbinary planets orbiting double-lined binaries with the DOLBY method of radial-velocity extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets - planets that orbit both stars in a binary system - offer the opportunity to study planet formation and orbital migration in a different environment compare to single stars. However, despite the fact that &gt; 90% of binary systems in the solar neighbourhood are spectrally resolved double-lined binaries, there has been only one detection of a circumbinary planet orbitting a double-lined binary using the radial velocity method so far. Spectrally disentangling both components of a binary system is hard to do accurately. Weak spectral lines blend with one another in a time-varying way, and inaccuracy in spectral modelling can lead to an inaccurate estimation of the radial-velocity of each component. This inaccuracy adds scatter to the measurements that can hide the weak radial-velocity signature of circumbinary exoplanets. We have obtained new high signal-to-noise and high-resolution spectra with the SOPHIE spectrograph, mounted on the 193cm telescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP) for six, bright, double-lined binaries for which a circumbinary exoplanet detection has been attempted in the past. To extract radial-velocities we use the DOLBY code, a recent method of spectral disentangling using Gaussian processes to model the time-varying components. We analyse the resulting radial-velocities with a diffusive nested sampler to seek planets, and compute sensitivity limits.
  We do not detect any new circumbinary planet. However, we show that the combination of new data, new radial-velocity extraction methods, and new statistical methods to determine a dataset's sensitivity to planets leads to an approximately one order of magnitude improvement compared to previous results. This improvement brings us into the range of known circumbinary exoplanets and paves the way for new campaigns of observations targeting double-lined binaries.</description>

      <title>Analyzing black-hole ringdowns II: data conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data from observations of black hole ringdown gravitational waves are often analyzed in the time domain by using damped sinusoid models with acyclic boundary conditions. Data conditioning operations, including downsampling, filtering, and the choice of data segment duration, reduce the computational cost of such analyses and can improve numerical stability. Here we analyze simulated damped sinsuoid signals to illustrate how data conditioning operations, if not carefully applied, can undesirably alter the analysis' posterior distributions. We discuss how currently implemented downsampling and filtering methods, if applied too aggressively, can introduce systematic errors and skew tests of general relativity. These issues arise because current downsampling and filtering methods do not operate identically on the data and model. Alternative downsampling and filtering methods which identically operate on the data and model may be achievable, but we argue that the current operations can still be implemented safely. We also show that our preferred anti-alias filtering technique, which has an instantaneous frequency-domain response at its roll-off frequency, preserves the structure of posterior distributions better than other commonly used filters with transient frequency-domain responses. Lastly, we highlight that exceptionally long data segments may need to be analyzed in cases where thin lines in the noise power spectral density overlap with central signal frequencies. Our findings may be broadly applicable to any analysis of truncated time domain data with acyclic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>REXPACO ASDI: Joint unmixing and deconvolution of the circumstellar environment by angular and spectral differential imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular and spectral differential imaging is an observational technique of choice to investigate the immediate vicinity of stars. The relative angular motion and spectral scaling between on-axis and off-axis sources are exploited by post-processing techniques to separate two components: the residual star light and the light coming from surrounding objects such as circumstellar disks or point-like objects. This paper introduces a new algorithm to jointly unmix these two components and deconvolve disk images. The proposed algorithm is based on a statistical modeling of the residual star light, accounting for its spatial and spectral correlations. While critical, these correlations are not modeled and compensated for by existing reconstruction algorithms. We leverage dedicated shrinkage techniques to estimate the large number of parameters of our model of correlations in a data-driven fashion. We show that the resulting separable model of the spatial and spectral covariances captures very accurately the star light, thus allowing its efficient suppression. We apply our method on several datasets from the VLT/SPHERE instrument and compare the performances against standard algorithms of the field (cADI, PCA). We show that accounting for the multiple correlations of the data significantly enhances the reconstruction quality, leading to better preservation of both the disk morphology and photometry. Thanks to its unique joint spectral modeling of the data, the proposed algorithm can reconstruct disks having a circular symmetry (e.g., rings, spirals) at intensities one million times fainter than the star, without resorting to additional reference datasets free from the off-axis objects.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Noisy Data With Negative Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04855v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.</description>

      <title>Development of the cadmium zinc TElluride Radiation Imager (TERI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cadmium zinc TElluride Radiation Imager, or TERI, is an instrument to space qualify large-volume $4 \times 4 \times 1.5 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ pixelated CdZnTe (CZT) detector technology. The CZT's anode is composed of a $22 \times 22$ array of pixels while the cathode is planar. TERI will contain four of those crystals with each pixel having an energy range of $40 \ \mathrm{keV}$ up to $3 \ \mathrm{MeV}$ with a resolution of $1.3 \%$ full-width-at-half maximum at $662 \ \mathrm{keV}$ all while operating in room temperature. As the detectors are 3D position sensitive, TERI can Compton image events. TERI is fitted with a coded-aperture mask which permits imaging low energy photons in the photoelectric regime. TERI's primary mission is to space-qualify large-volume CZT and measure its degradation due to radiation damage in a space environment. Its secondary mission includes detecting and localizing astrophysical gamma-ray transients. TERI is manifested on DoD's STP-H10 mission for launch to the International Space Station in early 2025.</description>

      <title>Application of convolutional neural networks for extensive air shower separation in the SPHERE-3 experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new SPHERE-3 telescope is being developed for cosmic rays spectrum and mass composition studies in the 5--1000 PeV energy range. Registration of extensive air showers using reflected Cherenkov light method applied in the SPHERE detector series requires a good trigger system for accurate separation of events from the background produced by starlight and airglow photons reflected from the snow. Here we present the results of convolutional networks application for the classification of images obtained from Monte Carlo simulation of the detector. Detector response simulations include photons tracing through the optical system, silicon photomultiplier operation and electronics response and digitization process. The results are compared to the SPHERE-2 trigger system performance.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Variables in TESS Full-Frame Image Light Curves Identified via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission measured light from stars in ~85% of the sky throughout its two-year primary mission, resulting in millions of TESS 30-minute cadence light curves to analyze in the search for transiting exoplanets. To search this vast dataset, we aim to provide an approach that is both computationally efficient, produces highly performant predictions, and minimizes the required human search effort. We present a convolutional neural network that we train to identify short period variables. To make a prediction for a given light curve, our network requires no prior target parameters identified using other methods. Our network performs inference on a TESS 30-minute cadence light curve in ~5ms on a single GPU, enabling large scale archival searches. We present a collection of 14156 short-period variables identified by our network. The majority of our identified variables fall into two prominent populations, one of short-period main sequence binaries and another of Delta Scuti stars. Our neural network model and related code is additionally provided as open-source code for public use and extension.</description>

      <title>How much information can be extracted from galaxy clustering at the field level?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optimal Bayesian field-level cosmological constraints from nonlinear tracers of the large-scale structure, specifically the amplitude $\sigma_8$ of linear matter fluctuations inferred from rest-frame simulated dark matter halos in a comoving volume of $8\,(h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc})^3$. Our constraint on $\sigma_8$ is entirely due to nonlinear information, and obtained by explicitly sampling the initial conditions along with bias and noise parameters via a Lagrangian EFT-based forward model, LEFTfield. The comparison with a simulation-based inference analysis employing the power spectrum and bispectrum -- likewise using the LEFTfield forward model -- shows that, when including precisely the same modes of the same data up to $k_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.12\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), the field-level approach yields a factor of 3.5 (5.2) improvement on the $\sigma_8$ constraint, from 20.0% to 5.7% (17.0% to 3.3%). This study provides direct insights into cosmological information encoded in galaxy clustering beyond low-order $n$-point functions.</description>

      <title>Modeling optical systematics for the Taurus CMB experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate a variety of optical systematics for Taurus, a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation experiment, to assess their impact on large-scale E-mode polarisation measurements and constraints of the optical depth to reionisation {\tau}. We model a one-month flight of Taurus from Wanaka, New Zealand aboard a super-pressure balloon (SPB). We simulate night-time scans of both the CMB and dust foregrounds in the 150GHz band, one of Taurus's four observing bands. We consider a variety of possible systematics that may affect Taurus's observations, including non-gaussian beams, pointing reconstruction error, and half-wave plate (HWP) non-idealities. For each of these, we evaluate the residual power in the difference between maps simulated with and without the systematic, and compare this to the expected signal level corresponding to Taurus's science goals. Our results indicate that most of the HWP-related systematics can be mitigated to be smaller than sample variance by calibrating with Planck's TT spectrum and using an achromatic HWP model, with a preference for five layers of sapphire to ensure good systematic control. However, additional beam characterization will be required to mitigate far-sidelobe pickup from dust on larger scales.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): I. Overview, Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling, and Stokes Profile Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multi-line spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our "SPIn4D" project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been conducted; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least $25\times25\times8$ Mm with $16\times16\times12$ km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe I lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available, with 13.7 TB in the initial release.</description>

Abstract: We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barb\'a 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barb\'a. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.</description>
