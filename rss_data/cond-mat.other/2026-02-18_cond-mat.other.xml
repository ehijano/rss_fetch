      <title>Displacement general solutions in strain gradient elasticity: review and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide an overview of general solutions for displacement fields in static problems of isotropic strain gradient elasticity (SGE). We not only review existing solutions but also derive new representations, showing that all classical elasticity solutions - including those of Boussinesq-Galerkin, Papkovich-Neuber, Naghdi, Lame, Love and Boussinesq - can be simply generalized to SGE framework. In general, it is shown that SGE enables the use of any classical general solution representation combined with a Helmholtz decomposition for the gradient part of the displacement field. Consistency is also established between the presented Papkovich-Neuber representation and the general solutions of SGE proposed previously by Mindlin (1964), Lurie et al. (2006) and Charalambopoulos et al. (2020). Furthermore, we establish the relationships between the stress functions of different general solutions and show their completeness.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Spin Lifetime and Long-Range Spin Transport in p-Silicon using Spin Gapless Semiconductor as Ferromagnetic Injector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13118</link>

Abstract: Electrical spin injection and transport in silicon are central challenges for realizing semiconductor-based spintronic devices, particularly in p-type Si, where strong spin relaxation and interface effects often suppress detectable spin signals. Here, we report electrical spin injection, accumulation, and transport in lightly doped p-type silicon using the spin-gapless Heusler compound Mn$_2$CoAl as a ferromagnetic spin injector, separated from the p-Si channel by a thin MgO tunnel barrier in a lateral device geometry. Spin transport is systematically investigated through three-terminal (3-T) Hanle and four-terminal (4-T) nonlocal (NL) spin-valve and Hanle measurements. Clear Lorentzian Hanle signals are observed in the 3-T configuration from 5 K up to room temperature, yielding a spin lifetime of $\sim$0.68 ns at 300 K that increases to $\sim$4.11 ns at 5 K. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals a weak power-law dependence of the spin lifetime, indicating Bir--Aronov--Pikus--type spin relaxation mechanism. To validate genuine spin transport, NL spin-valve and Hanle measurements were performed, revealing well-defined spin-valve switching and controlled spin precession at 5 K. From NL Hanle fitting, a spin lifetime of $\sim$5.65 ns and a spin diffusion length of $\sim$0.82 $\mu$m are extracted, confirming diffusive long-range spin transport in the p-Si channel. Although NL signals diminish at elevated temperatures due to reduced interfacial spin polarization and thermal noise, the combined 3-T and 4-T results establish spin-gapless Mn$_2$CoAl as an effective spin injector for p-type silicon. These findings highlight the potential of spin-gapless semiconductors for improving spin injection efficiency and advancing Si-compatible spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>From One to Two Dimensions: Magnetic Phases in Weakly Coupled Spin Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large variety of materials can be approximately described by means of spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. Here, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm together with a previously established numerical self-consistent mean-field approximation is used to investigate the magnetic properties of spin ladders coupled in a second dimension. The full ground state phase diagram including spin-gapped, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and fully polarized phases is presented as a function of interladder and intraladder coupling and magnetic field. Measurement of the dependence of magnetization on applied magnetic field is shown to enable location of a material on the phase diagram and determination of the Hamiltonian parameters. These results provide a practical route toward identifying and characterizing magnetic materials composed of coupled spin ladders.</description>
