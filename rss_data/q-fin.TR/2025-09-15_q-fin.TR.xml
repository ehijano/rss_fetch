      <title>Competition and Incentives in a Shared Order Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent regulation on intraday electricity markets has led to the development of shared order books with the intention to foster competition and increase market liquidity. In this paper, we address the question of the efficiency of such regulations by analysing the situation of two exchanges sharing a single limit order book, i.e. a quote by a market maker can be hit by a trade arriving on the other exchange. We develop a Principal-Agent model where each exchange acts as the Principal of her own market maker acting as her Agent. Exchanges and market makers have all CARA utility functions with potentially different risk-aversion parameters. In terms of mathematical result, we show existence and uniqueness of the resulting Nash equilibrium between exchanges, give the optimal incentive contracts and provide numerical solution to the PDE satisfied by the certainty equivalent of the exchanges. From an economic standpoint, our model demonstrates that incentive provision constitutes a public good. More precisely, it highlights the presence of a competitiveness spillover effect: when one exchange optimally incentivizes its market maker, the competing exchange also reaps indirect benefits. This interdependence gives rise to a free-rider problem. Given that providing incentives entails a cost, the strategic interaction between exchanges may lead to an equilibrium in which neither platform offers incentives -- ultimately resulting in diminished overall competition.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Extreme Events: Empirical Analysis of Mechanisms and Recovery in a Historical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of Ultrafast Extreme Events (UEEs), the influence of algorithmic trading or high-frequency traders is of major interest as they make it extremely difficult to intervene and to stabilize financial markets. In an empirical analysis, we compare various characteristics of UEEs over different years for the US stock market to assess the possible non-stationarity of the effects. We show that liquidity plays a dominant role in the emergence of UEEs and find a general pattern in their dynamics. We also empirically investigate the after-effects in view of the recovery rate. We find common patterns for different years. We explain changes in the recovery rate by varying market sentiments for the different years.</description>
