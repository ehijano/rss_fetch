      <title>ObjectMover: Generative Object Movement with Video Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple as it seems, moving an object to another location within an image is, in fact, a challenging image-editing task that requires re-harmonizing the lighting, adjusting the pose based on perspective, accurately filling occluded regions, and ensuring coherent synchronization of shadows and reflections while maintaining the object identity. In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ev-Layout: A Large-scale Event-based Multi-modal Dataset for Indoor Layout Estimation and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Ev-Layout, a novel large-scale event-based multi-modal dataset designed for indoor layout estimation and tracking. Ev-Layout makes key contributions to the community by: Utilizing a hybrid data collection platform (with a head-mounted display and VR interface) that integrates both RGB and bio-inspired event cameras to capture indoor layouts in motion. Incorporating time-series data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and ambient lighting conditions recorded during data collection to highlight the potential impact of motion speed and lighting on layout estimation accuracy. The dataset consists of 2.5K sequences, including over 771.3K RGB images and 10 billion event data points. Of these, 39K images are annotated with indoor layouts, enabling research in both event-based and video-based indoor layout estimation. Based on the dataset, we propose an event-based layout estimation pipeline with a novel event-temporal distribution feature module to effectively aggregate the spatio-temporal information from events. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal feature fusion module that can be easily integrated into a transformer module for fusion purposes. Finally, we conduct benchmarking and extensive experiments on the Ev-Layout dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of dynamic indoor layout estimation compared to existing event-based methods.</description>

      <title>AnyMoLe: Any Character Motion In-betweening Leveraging Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.</description>

      <title>Bokeh Diffusion: Defocus Blur Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics -- such as depth-of-field -- current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.</description>

      <title>GarmentCrafter: Progressive Novel View Synthesis for Single-View 3D Garment Reconstruction and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GarmentCrafter, a new approach that enables non-professional users to create and modify 3D garments from a single-view image. While recent advances in image generation have facilitated 2D garment design, creating and editing 3D garments remains challenging for non-professional users. Existing methods for single-view 3D reconstruction often rely on pre-trained generative models to synthesize novel views conditioning on the reference image and camera pose, yet they lack cross-view consistency, failing to capture the internal relationships across different views. In this paper, we tackle this challenge through progressive depth prediction and image warping to approximate novel views. Subsequently, we train a multi-view diffusion model to complete occluded and unknown clothing regions, informed by the evolving camera pose. By jointly inferring RGB and depth, GarmentCrafter enforces inter-view coherence and reconstructs precise geometries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual fidelity and inter-view coherence compared to state-of-the-art single-view 3D garment reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>Generative Video Bi-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel generative video model by robustly learning temporal change as a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) flow with a bilinear objective of combining two aspects: The first is to map from the past into future video frames directly. Previous work has mapped the noise to new frames, a more computationally expensive process. Unfortunately, starting from the previous frame, instead of noise, is more prone to drifting errors. Hence, second, we additionally learn how to remove the accumulated errors as the joint objective by adding noise during training. We demonstrate unconditional video generation in a streaming manner for various video datasets, all at competitive quality compared to a baseline conditional diffusion but with higher speed, i.e., fewer ODE solver steps.</description>

      <title>Bernstein polynomials: a bibliometric data analysis since the year 1949 based on the Scopus database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It's hard to imagine human life in the digital and AI age without polynomials because they are everywhere but mostly invisible to ordinary people: in data trends, on computer screens, in the shapes around us, and in the very fabric of technology. One of these, the simple but elegant Bernstein polynomials, was discovered by a scientist from the Russian Empire, Sergei Bernstein, in 1912 and plays a central role in mathematical analysis, computational and applied mathematics, geometric modelling, computer-aided geometric design, computer graphics and other areas of science and engineering. They have been the sub-ject of much research for over a hundred years. However, no work has carried out database-derived research analysis, such as bibliometric, keyword or network analysis, or more generally, data analysis of manuscript data related to Bernstein polynomials extracted from digital academic databases. This work, which appears to be the first-ever attempt at the bibliometric data analysis of Bernstein polynomials, aims to fill this gap and open researchers' eyes to potentially new or underexplored areas of mathematics and engineering where Bernstein polynomials may one day be used to make discoveries. The results may be helpful to academics researching Bernstein polynomials and looking for potential applications, collaborators, supervisors, funding or journals to publish in.</description>

      <title>ForceGrip: Data-Free Curriculum Learning for Realistic Grip Force Control in VR Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on a kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Make-It-Animatable: An Efficient Framework for Authoring Animation-Ready 3D Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D characters are essential to modern creative industries, but making them animatable often demands extensive manual work in tasks like rigging and skinning. Existing automatic rigging tools face several limitations, including the necessity for manual annotations, rigid skeleton topologies, and limited generalization across diverse shapes and poses. An alternative approach is to generate animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However, this method often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human shapes. To address these issues, we present Make-It-Animatable, a novel data-driven method to make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second, regardless of its shapes and poses. Our unified framework generates high-quality blend weights, bones, and pose transformations. By incorporating a particle-based shape autoencoder, our approach supports various 3D representations, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splats. Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a structure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even for characters with non-standard skeleton structures. We conducted extensive experiments to validate our framework's effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both quality and speed. More demos and code are available at https://jasongzy.github.io/Make-It-Animatable/.</description>

      <title>INPC: Implicit Neural Point Clouds for Radiance Field Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for reconstruction and novel view synthesis of unbounded real-world scenes. In contrast to previous methods using either volumetric fields, grid-based models, or discrete point cloud proxies, we propose a hybrid scene representation, which implicitly encodes the geometry in a continuous octree-based probability field and view-dependent appearance in a multi-resolution hash grid. This allows for extraction of arbitrary explicit point clouds, which can be rendered using rasterization. In doing so, we combine the benefits of both worlds and retain favorable behavior during optimization: Our novel implicit point cloud representation and differentiable bilinear rasterizer enable fast rendering while preserving the fine geometric detail captured by volumetric neural fields. Furthermore, this representation does not depend on priors like structure-from-motion point clouds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art image quality on common benchmarks. Furthermore, we achieve fast inference at interactive frame rates, and can convert our trained model into a large, explicit point cloud to further enhance performance.</description>

      <title>RealmDreamer: Text-Driven 3D Scene Generation with Inpainting and Depth Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RealmDreamer, a technique for generating forward-facing 3D scenes from text descriptions. Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

      <title>HDRT: A Large-Scale Dataset for Infrared-Guided HDR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capturing images with enough details to solve imaging tasks is a long-standing challenge in imaging, particularly due to the limitations of standard dynamic range (SDR) images which often lose details in underexposed or overexposed regions. Traditional high dynamic range (HDR) methods, like multi-exposure fusion or inverse tone mapping, struggle with ghosting and incomplete data reconstruction. Infrared (IR) imaging offers a unique advantage by being less affected by lighting conditions, providing consistent detail capture regardless of visible light intensity. In this paper, we introduce the HDRT dataset, the first comprehensive dataset that consists of HDR and thermal IR images. The HDRT dataset comprises 50,000 images captured across three seasons over six months in eight cities, providing a diverse range of lighting conditions and environmental contexts. Leveraging this dataset, we propose HDRTNet, a novel deep neural method that fuses IR and SDR content to generate HDR images. Extensive experiments validate HDRTNet against the state-of-the-art, showing substantial quantitative and qualitative quality improvements. The HDRT dataset not only advances IR-guided HDR imaging but also offers significant potential for broader research in HDR imaging, multi-modal fusion, domain transfer, and beyond. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jingchao-peng/HDRTDataset.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study on the Use of 3D Scatterplots as 2D Figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D scatterplots are a well-established plotting technique that can be used to represent data with three or more dimensions. On paper and computer monitors they are essentially two-dimensional projections of the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. This transition from the 3D space to two dimensions is not done consistently among scientific software, as there is currently limited quantifiable evidence on the effectiveness of each approach. Notably, the frequent lack of visual cues such as with regard to depth perception is equivalent to a reduction of dimensionality by one. Hence, their use in manuscripts is less common or straightforward.
  In this empirical study, an online survey is conducted within an academic institution to identify and quantify the effectiveness of feature or feature combinations on 3D scatterplots in terms of reading time and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The translation of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) images is an important computer vision task. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task, that is, the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., {LDR,HDR}. This paper proposes LLM-HDR, a method that integrates the perception of Large Language Models (LLM) into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. LLM-HDR is the first to use an LLM for the {LDR,HDR} translation task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

      <title>KinMo: Kinematic-aware Human Motion Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current human motion synthesis frameworks rely on global action descriptions, creating a modality gap that limits both motion understanding and generation capabilities. A single coarse description, such as ``run", fails to capture details like variations in speed, limb positioning, and kinematic dynamics, leading to ambiguities between text and motion modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{KinMo}, a unified framework built on a hierarchical describable motion representation that extends beyond global action by incorporating kinematic group movements and their interactions. We design an automated annotation pipeline to generate high-quality, fine-grained descriptions for this decomposition, resulting in the KinMo dataset. To leverage these structured descriptions, we propose Hierarchical Text-Motion Alignment, improving spatial understanding by integrating additional motion details. Furthermore, we introduce a coarse-to-fine generation procedure to leverage enhanced spatial understanding to improve motion synthesis. Experimental results show that KinMo significantly improves motion understanding, demonstrated by enhanced text-motion retrieval performance and enabling more fine-grained motion generation and editing capabilities.

      <title>PanoDreamer: Optimization-Based Single Image to 360 3D Scene With Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present PanoDreamer, a novel method for producing a coherent 360{\deg} 3D scene from a single input image. Unlike existing methods that generate the scene sequentially, we frame the problem as single-image panorama and depth estimation. Once the coherent panoramic image and its corresponding depth are obtained, the scene can be reconstructed by inpainting the small occluded regions and projecting them into 3D space. Our key contribution is formulating single-image panorama and depth estimation as two optimization tasks and introducing alternating minimization strategies to effectively solve their objectives. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing techniques in single-image 360{\deg} 3D scene reconstruction in terms of consistency and overall quality.</description>

      <title>RealVVT: Towards Photorealistic Video Virtual Try-on via Spatio-Temporal Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual try-on has emerged as a pivotal task at the intersection of computer vision and fashion, aimed at digitally simulating how clothing items fit on the human body. Despite notable progress in single-image virtual try-on (VTO), current methodologies often struggle to preserve a consistent and authentic appearance of clothing across extended video sequences. This challenge arises from the complexities of capturing dynamic human pose and maintaining target clothing characteristics. We leverage pre-existing video foundation models to introduce RealVVT, a photoRealistic Video Virtual Try-on framework tailored to bolster stability and realism within dynamic video contexts. Our methodology encompasses a Clothing &amp; Temporal Consistency strategy, an Agnostic-guided Attention Focus Loss mechanism to ensure spatial consistency, and a Pose-guided Long Video VTO technique adept at handling extended video sequences.Extensive experiments across various datasets confirms that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both single-image and video VTO tasks, offering a viable solution for practical applications within the realms of fashion e-commerce and virtual fitting environments.</description>

      <title>NPSim: Nighttime Photorealistic Simulation From Daytime Images With Monocular Inverse Rendering and Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is an important task for autonomous driving. A powerful autonomous driving system should be capable of handling images under all conditions, including nighttime. Generating accurate and diverse nighttime semantic segmentation datasets is crucial for enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms in low-light conditions. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach named NPSim, which enables the simulation of realistic nighttime images from real daytime counterparts with monocular inverse rendering and ray tracing. NPSim comprises two key components: mesh reconstruction and relighting. The mesh reconstruction component generates an accurate representation of the scene structure by combining geometric information extracted from the input RGB image and semantic information from its corresponding semantic labels. The relighting component integrates real-world nighttime light sources and material characteristics to simulate the complex interplay of light and object surfaces under low-light conditions. The scope of this thesis mainly focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the mesh reconstruction component. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh reconstruction component in producing high-quality scene meshes and their generality across different autonomous driving datasets. We also propose a detailed experiment plan for evaluating the entire pipeline, including both quantitative metrics in training state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches and human perceptual studies, aiming to indicate the capability of our approach to generate realistic nighttime images and the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.</description>
