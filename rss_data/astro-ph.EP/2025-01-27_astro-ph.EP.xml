      <title>Highly reflective white clouds on the western dayside of an exo-Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-irradiated gas giant exoplanets are predicted to show circulation patterns dominated by day-to-night heat transport and a spatial distribution of clouds that is driven by advection and local heating. Hot-Jupiters have been extensively studied from broadband phase-curve observations at infrared and optical wavelengths, but spectroscopic observations in the reflected light are rare and the regime of smaller and higher-metallicity ultra-hot planets, such as hot-Neptunes, remains largely unexplored to date. Here we present the phase-resolved reflected-light and thermal-emission spectroscopy of the ultra-hot Neptune LTT 9779b, obtained through observing its full phase-curve from 0.6 to 2.8 $\mu$m with JWST NIRISS/SOSS. We detect an asymmetric dayside in reflected light (3.1$\sigma$ significance) with highly-reflective white clouds on the western dayside (A = 0.79$\pm$0.15) and a much lower-albedo eastern dayside (A = 0.41$\pm$0.10), resulting in an overall dayside albedo of A = 0.50$\pm$0.07. The thermal phase curve is symmetric about the substellar point, with a dayside effective temperature of T$_\mathrm{eff,day}$ = 2,260$^{+40}_{-50}$ K and a cold nightside (T$_\mathrm{eff,night}$ &lt;1,330 K at 3-$\sigma$ confidence), indicative of short radiative timescales. We propose an atmospheric circulation and cloud distribution regime in which heat is transported eastward from the dayside towards the cold nightside by an equatorial jet, leading to a colder western dayside where temperatures are sufficiently low for the condensation of silicate clouds.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limits of Habitability: A Catalog of Rocky Exoplanets in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several ground- and space-based searches have increased the number of known exoplanets to nearly 6000. While most are highly unlike our planet, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide the most intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As the detections increase, it is critical to probe the HZ as well as its limits empirically using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to probe the limits of surface habitability. We analyze all known exoplanets and identify 67 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 38 in a narrower 3D-model HZ. We compare their demographics with the full catalog of exoplanets, analyze their characteristics, give HZ limits for each system, and prioritize targets for observation. We address another critical dimension to this exploration and compile missing stellar age estimates for these candidates.
  To probe the limits of habitability, we identify several transiting and non-transiting rocky planets that can provide constraints on the inner and outer edge of the HZ, explore how eccentricity influences habitability, and identify the oldest HZ worlds as well as exoplanets with similar flux to modern Earth's. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize their search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes -- such as the James Webb Space Telescope, the Extremely Large Telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, and LIFE -- and to design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these intriguing worlds, addressing the question of the limits of surface habitability on exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Global Distribution of Serpentine on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution and origin of serpentine on Mars can provide insights into the planet's aqueous history, habitability, and past climate. In this study, we used dynamic aperture factor analysis/target transformation applied to 15,760 images from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, followed by validation with the radiance ratio method, to construct a map of Mg-serpentine deposits on Mars. Although relatively rare, Mg-serpentine was detected in diverse geomorphic settings across Noachian and Hesperian-aged terrains in the southern highlands of Mars, implying that serpentinization was active on early Mars and that multiple formation mechanisms may be needed to explain its spatial distribution. We also calculated the amount of H2 produced during the formation of the observed deposits and conclude that serpentinization was likely more widespread on Mars than indicated by the observed distribution.</description>

      <title>Orbital Dynamics of Atlas (S XV): Its Current Orbit and the Recent Past</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study comprehensively analyzes Atlas's current orbit, focusing on the secular and resonant perturbations caused by Prometheus, Pandora, and Saturn's oblateness. We performed numerical integration of the exact equations of motion for a dense ensemble of Atlas clone satellites. Through spectral analysis and interpretation of these orbits on dynamical maps, we identified the domain of the 54:53 Prometheus-Atlas and 70:67 Pandora-Atlas mean-motion resonances, showing that Atlas lies on the boundary of the separatrices of each of these resonances. We also identified the domains for the multiplets $\Psi_{1}$, $\Psi_{2}$, $\Psi_{3}$ and $\Psi_{4}$ associated with 70:67 resonance. Additionally, we explored the variation in Prometheus's eccentricity, demonstrating that as eccentricity increases (or decreases) in the 54:53 resonance domain correspondingly decreases (or increases). This combined analysis, between the above mappings, revealed qualitatively the overlap between the 54:53 and 70:67 resonances, which are responsible for the chaotic behavior of Atlas's orbit. We quantified chaotic motion in frequency space and found that the vicinity of Atlas is characterized by weak to moderate chaos, rather than strong chaos. Finally, we investigated Atlas's recent past, considering Prometheus's migration under the influence of Saturn's tidal forces. This analysis reveals several resonances crossed in the past, particularly focusing on the Atlas-Prometheus pair, which exhibited a co-orbital configuration.</description>

      <title>The NCORES Program: Precise planetary masses, null results, and insight into the planet mass distribution near the radius gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NCORES was a large observing program on the ESO HARPS spectrograph, dedicated to measuring the masses of Neptune-like and smaller transiting planets discovered by the TESS satellite using the radial velocity technique. This paper presents an overview of the programme, its scientific goals and published results, covering 35 planets in 18 planetary systems. We present spectrally derived stellar characterisation and mass constraints for five additional TOIs where radial velocity observations found only marginally significant signals (TOI-510.01, $M_p=1.08^{+0.58}_{-0.55}M_\oplus$), or found no signal (TOIs 271.01, 641.01, 697.01 and 745.01). A newly detected non-transiting radial velocity candidate is presented orbiting TOI-510 on a 10.0d orbit, with a minimum mass of $4.82^{+1.29}_{-1.26}M_\oplus$, although uncertainties on the system architecture and true orbital period remain. Combining the NCORES sample with archival known planets we investigate the distribution of planet masses and compositions around and below the radius gap, finding that the population of planets below the gap is consistent with a rocky composition and ranges up to a sharp cut-off at $10M_\oplus$. We compare the observed distribution to models of pebble- and planetesimal-driven formation and evolution, finding good broad agreement with both models while highlighting interesting areas of potential discrepancy. Increased numbers of precisely measured planet masses in this parameter space are required to distinguish between pebble and planetesimal accretion.</description>

      <title>JWST COMPASS: NIRSpec/G395H Transmission Observations of the Super-Earth TOI-776b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two transit observations of the $\sim$520K, 1.85R$_\oplus$, 4.0M$_\oplus$ super-Earth TOI-776b with JWST NIRSpec/G395H, resulting in a 2.8-5.2$\mu$m transmission spectrum. Producing reductions using the ExoTiC-JEDI and Eureka! pipelines, we obtain a median transit depth precision of 34ppm for both visits and both reductions in spectroscopic channels 30 pixels wide ($\sim$0.02$\mu$m). We find that our independent reductions produce consistent transmission spectra, however, each visit shows differing overall structure. For both reductions, a flat line is preferred for Visit 1 while a flat line with an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors is preferred for Visit 2; however, we are able to correct for this offset during our modeling analysis following methods outlined in previous literature. Using picaso forward models, we can rule out metallicities up to at least 100$\times$ solar with an opaque pressure of 10$^{-3}$ bar to $\geq$3$\sigma$ in all cases, however, the exact lower limit varies between the visits, with Visit 1 ruling out $\lesssim$100$\times$ solar while the lower limits for Visit 2 extend beyond $\sim$350$\times$ solar. Our results add to the growing list of super-Earth atmospheric constraints by JWST, which provide critical insight into the diversity and challenges of characterizing terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>JWST 1.5 {\mu}m and 4.8 {\mu}m Photometry of Y Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs lack nuclear fusion and cool with time; the coldest known have an effective temperature below 500 K, and are known as Y dwarfs. We present a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometric dataset of Y dwarfs: twenty-three were imaged in wide-field mode, 20 using NIRCam with the F150W and F480M filters, and 3 using NIRISS with the F480M filter. We present an F480M vs. F150W $-$ F480M color-magnitude diagram for our sample, and other brown dwarfs with F150W and F480M colors synthesized from JWST spectra by Beiler et al. (2024). For one target, WISEA J083011.95$+$283716.0, its detection in the near-infrared confirms it as one of the reddest Y dwarfs known, with F150W $-$ F480M $= 9.62$ mag. We provide its updated parallax and proper motion. One of the Beiler et al. Y dwarfs, CWISEP J104756.81+545741.6, is unusually blue, consistent with strong CO absorption seen in its spectrum which the F480M filter is particularly sensitive to. The strong CO and the kinematics of the object suggest it may be very low-mass and young. We update the resolved photometry for the close binary system WISE J033605.05$-$014350.4 AB, and find that the secondary is almost as cold as WISE 085510.83$-$071442.5, with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 300$ K, however the F150W $-$ F480M color is significantly bluer, possibly suggesting the presence of water clouds. Astrometry is measured at the JWST epoch for the sample which is consistent with parallax and proper motion values reported by Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) and Marocco et al. (in prep).</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Mass Loss from TOI-1259 A b, a Gas Giant Planet With a White Dwarf Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of close-in Neptune-mass exoplanets evident in transit surveys has largely been attributed either to photoevaporative mass loss or high-eccentricity migration. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigate the origins of TOI-1259 A b, a Saturn-mass (0.4 M$_J$, 1.0 R$_J$) exoplanet lying along the upper edge of the Neptune desert. TOI-1259 A b's close-in ($P$ = 3.48 days) orbit and low bulk density make the planet particularly vulnerable to photoevaporation. Using transits observed in the 1083 nm metastable helium line, we probe the upper atmosphere of TOI-1259 A b with the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory and the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on Keck II. We report an excess absorption of $0.395\pm{0.072}\%$ with Palomar and a blueshifted absorption of $2.4\pm0.52\%$ with Keck, consistent with an extended escaping atmosphere. Fitting this signal with a Parker wind model, we determine a corresponding atmospheric mass loss rate of log($\dot{M}$) = $10.33\pm 0.13$ g/s for a thermosphere temperature of $8400^{+1200}_{-1000}$ K based on the Palomar absorption and log($\dot{M}$) = $10.0\pm 0.1$ g/s for a thermosphere temperature of $8200^{+1000}_{-900}$ K based on the Keck absorption. This relatively low rate suggests that this planet would not have been significantly altered by mass loss even if it formed in-situ. However, the presence of a white dwarf companion, TOI-1259 B, hints that this planet may not have formed close-in, but rather migrated inward relatively late. Given the estimated parameters of the proto-white dwarf companion, we find that high-eccentricity migration is possible for the system.</description>

      <title>Revealing asymmetry on midplane of proto-planetary disc through modelling of axisymmetric emission: methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework for deriving the surface brightness profile and geometry of a geometrically-thin axisymmetric disc from interferometric observation of continuum emission. Such precise modelling facilitates the exploration of faint non-axisymmetric structures, such as spirals and circumplanetary discs. As a demonstration, we simulate interferometric observations of geometrically-thin axisymmetric discs. The proposed method can reasonably recover the injected axisymmetric structures, whereas Gaussian fitting of the same data yielded larger errors in disc orientation estimation. To further test the applicability of the method, it was applied to the mock data for $m=1,2$ spirals and a point source, which are embedded in a bright axisymmetric structure. The injected non-axisymmetric structures were reasonably recovered except for the innermost parts, and the disc geometric parameter estimations were better than Gasussian fitting. The method was then applied to the real data of Elias 20 and AS 209, and it adequately subtracted the axisymmetric component, notably in Elias 20, where substantial residuals remained without our method. We also applied our method to continuum data of PDS 70 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We successfully recovered emission from PDS 70 c consistently with previous studies, and also tentatively discovered new substructures. The current formulation can be applied to any data for disc continuum emission, and aids in the search of spirals and circumplanetary discs, whose detection is still limited.</description>

      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation. In particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude with a discussion of the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and we sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>

Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.    Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.    Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.     Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise  or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>
