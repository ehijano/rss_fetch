      <title>Bridging Large Eddy Simulation and Reduced Order Modeling of Convection-Dominated Flows through Spatial Filtering: Review and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) have achieved a lot of success in reducing the computational cost of traditional numerical methods across many disciplines. For convection-dominated (e.g., turbulent) flows, however, standard ROMs generally yield inaccurate results, usually affected by spurious oscillations. Thus, ROMs are usually equipped with numerical stabilization or closure models to account for the effect of the discarded modes. The literature on ROM closures and stabilizations is large and growing fast. In this paper, we focus on one particular type of ROM closures and stabilizations that are inspired by Large Eddy Simulation (LES). These ROMs, which we call LES-ROMs, are extremely easy to implement, very efficient, and accurate. Carefully tuned LES-ROMs can accurately capture the average physical quantities of interest in challenging convection-dominated flows in many applications. LES-ROM are constructed by leveraging spatial filtering, i.e., the same principle used to build classical LES models. This ensures a modeling consistency between LES-ROMs and the approaches that generated the data used to train them. It also ``bridges'' two distinct research fields (LES and ROMs), disconnected until now. This paper is a review of LES-ROMs. It starts with a description of a versatile LES strategy called evolve-filter-relax (EFR) that has been successfully used as a full order method. We then show how the EFR strategy, and spatial filtering in general, can be leveraged to construct LES-ROMs. Several applications of LES-ROMs are presented. Finally, we draw conclusions and outline several research directions and open questions in the LES-ROM development. While we do not claim this review to be comprehensive, we certainly hope it serves as a brief and friendly introduction to this exciting research area, which has a lot of potential in practical numerical simulation of convection-dominated flows.</description>

      <title>Boiling stratified flow: a laboratory analogy for atmospheric moist convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel laboratory experiment, boiling stratified flow, as an analogy for atmospheric moist convection. A layer of diluted syrup is placed below freshwater in a beaker and heated from below. The vertical temperature profile in the experiment is analogous to the vapor mixing ratio in the atmosphere while the vertical profile of freshwater concentration in the experiment is analogous to the potential temperature profile in the atmosphere. Boiling starts when the bottom of the syrup layer reaches the boiling point, producing bubbles and vortex rings that stir the two-layer density interface and bring colder fresh water into the syrup layer. When the syrup layer at the beginning of the experiment is sufficiently thin and diluted, the vortex rings entrain more cold water than needed to remove superheating in the syrup layer, ending the boiling. When the syrup layer is deep and concentrated, the boiling is steady since the entrained colder water instantaneously removes the superheating in the bottom syrup layer. A theory is derived to predict the entrainment rate and the transition between the intermittent and steady boiling regimes, validated by experimental data. We suggest that these dynamics may share similarities with the mixing and lifecycle of cumulus convection.</description>

      <title>Modeling film flows down a rotating slippery cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear stability and dynamics of gravity-driven viscous films on a vertical rotating cylinder, considering both outer and inner surface flows with slip conditions at the cylinder wall. We develop an asymptotic model for the combined effects of rotation and wall slippage. Linear stability analysis indicates that wall slippage enhances instability on both surfaces, while rotation has differing impacts: it amplifies instability due to slip for outer surface flow but reduces it for inner surface flow. A weakly nonlinear stability analysis is then conducted to explore the combined impact of rotation and wall slip on flow stability beyond the linear regime, including the bifurcation of the nonlinear evolution equation for both surfaces. The traveling wave solution of the model is analyzed, showing how rotation affects nonlinear wave speed with a slippery wall. A stability analysis of the traveling wave solutions is also performed. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the free surface reveal that increasing slip length enhances the choke phenomenon in inner surface flow, while rotation can delay this effect. Additionally, simulations show that for flow along the outer surface of a slippery rotating cylinder, the film tends to break up into droplets in the presence of rotation.</description>

      <title>Generative prediction of flow field based on the diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometry-to-flow diffusion model that utilizes the input of obstacle shape to predict a flow field past the obstacle. The model is based on a learnable Markov transition kernel to recover the data distribution from the Gaussian distribution. The Markov process is conditioned on the obstacle geometry, estimating the noise to be removed at each step, implemented via a U-Net. A cross-attention mechanism incorporates the geometry as a prompt. We train the geometry-to-flow diffusion model using a dataset of flows past simple obstacles, including the circle, ellipse, rectangle, and triangle. For comparison, the CNN model is trained using the same dataset. Tests are carried out on flows past obstacles with simple and complex geometries, representing interpolation and extrapolation on the geometry condition, respectively. In the test set, challenging scenarios include a cross and characters `PKU'. Generated flow fields show that the geometry-to-flow diffusion model is superior to the CNN model in predicting instantaneous flow fields and handling complex geometries. Quantitative analysis of the model accuracy and divergence in the fields demonstrate the high robustness of the diffusion model, indicating that the diffusion model learns physical laws implicitly.</description>

      <title>Influence of fluid rheology on multistability in the unstable flow of polymer solutions through pore constriction arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse chemical, energy, environmental, and industrial processes involve the flow of polymer solutions in porous media. The accumulation and dissipation of elastic stresses as the polymers are transported through the tortuous, confined pore space can lead to the development of an elastic flow instability above a threshold flow rate. This flow instability can generate complex flows with strong spatiotemporal fluctuations, despite the low Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$); for example, in 1D ordered arrays of pore constrictions, this unstable flow can be multistable, with distinct pores exhibiting distinct unstable flow states. Here, we examine how this multistability is influenced by fluid rheology. Through experiments using diverse polymer solutions having systematic variations in fluid shear-thinning or elasticity, in pore constriction arrays of varying geometries, we show that the onset of multistability can be described using a single dimensionless parameter. This parameter, the streamwise Deborah number, compares the stress relaxation time of the polymer solution to the time required for the fluid to be advected between pore constrictions. Our work thus helps to deepen understanding of the influence of fluid rheology on elastic instabilities, helping to establish guidelines for the rational design of polymeric fluids with desirable flow behaviors.</description>

      <title>Turbulence modulation in liquid-liquid two-phase Taylor-Couette turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling effects of the two-phase interface, viscosity ratio, and density ratio of the dispersed phase to the continuous phase on the flow statistics in two-phase Taylor-Couette turbulence at a system Reynolds number of 6000 and a system Weber number of 10 using interface-resolved three-dimensional direct numerical simulations with the volume-of-fluid method. Our study focuses on four different scenarios: neutral droplets, low-viscosity droplets, light droplets, and low-viscosity light droplets. We find that neutral droplets and low-viscosity droplets primarily contribute to drag enhancement through the two-phase interface, while light droplets reduce the system's drag by explicitly reducing Reynolds stress due to the density dependence of Reynolds stress. Additionally, low-viscosity light droplets contribute to greater drag reduction by further reducing momentum transport near the inner cylinder and implicitly reducing Reynolds stress. While interfacial tension enhances turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) transport, drag enhancement is not strongly correlated with TKE transport for both neutral droplets and low-viscosity droplets. Light droplets primarily reduce the production term by diminishing Reynolds stress, whereas the density contrast between the phases boosts TKE transport near the inner wall. Therefore, the reduction in the dissipation rate is predominantly attributed to decreased turbulence production, causing drag reduction. For low-viscosity light droplets, the production term diminishes further, primarily due to their greater reduction in Reynolds stress, while reduced viscosity weakens the density difference's contribution to TKE transport near the inner cylinder, resulting in a more pronounced reduction in the dissipation rate and consequently stronger drag reduction. Our findings provide new insights into the turbulence modulation in two-phase flow.</description>

      <title>2.5D turbulence in shear-thinning jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimensional transition in turbulent jets of a shear-thinning fluid is studied via direct numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that under vertical confinement, the flow exhibits a unique mixed-dimensional (or 2.5D) state, where large-scale two-dimensional and small-scale three-dimensional structures coexist. This transition from three-dimensional turbulence near the inlet to two-dimensional dynamics downstream is dictated by the level of confinement: weak confinement guarantees turbulence to remain three-dimensional, whereas strong confinement forces the transition to two-dimensions; the mixed-dimensional state is observed for moderate confinement and it emerges as soon as flow scales are larger than the vertical length. In this scenario, we observed that the mixed-dimensional state is an overall more energetic state and it shows a multi-cascade process, where the direct cascade of energy at small scales and the direct cascade of enstrophy at large scales coexist. The results provide insights into the complex dynamics of confined turbulent flows, relevant in both natural and industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Basset history term for Lagrangian particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>Orbital cluster-based network modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel reduced-order methodology to describe complex multi-frequency fluid dynamics from time-resolved snapshot data. Starting point is the Cluster-based Network Model (CNM) thanks to its fully automatable development and human interpretability. Our key innovation is to model the transitions from cluster to cluster much more accurately by replacing snapshot states with short-term trajectories ("orbits") over multiple clusters, thus avoiding nonphysical intra-cluster diffusion in the dynamic reconstruction. The proposed orbital CNM (oCNM) employs functional clustering to coarse-grain the short-term trajectories. Specifically, different filtering techniques, resulting in different temporal basis expansions, demonstrate the versatility and capability of the oCNM to adapt to diverse flow phenomena. The oCNM is illustrated on the Stuart-Landau oscillator and its post-transient solution with time-varying parameters to test its ability to capture the amplitude selection mechanism and multi-frequency behaviours. Then, the oCNM is applied to the fluidic pinball across varying flow regimes at different Reynolds numbers, including the periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. This orbital-focused perspective enhances the understanding of complex temporal behaviours by incorporating high-frequency behaviour into the kinematics of short-time trajectories while modelling the dynamics of the lower frequencies. In analogy to Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which marked the transition from spatial-only modes to spatio-temporal ones, this work advances from analysing temporal local states to examining piecewise short-term trajectories, or orbits. By merging advanced analytical methods, such as the functional representation of short-time trajectories with CNM, this study paves the way for new approaches to dissect the complex dynamics characterising turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>A Josephson-Anderson relation for drag in classical channel flows with streamwise periodicity: Effects of wall roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed Josephson-Anderson relation equates instantaneous work by pressure drop over any streamwise segment of a general channel and wall-normal flux of spanwise vorticity spatially integrated over that section. This relation was first derived by Huggins for quantum superfluids, but it holds also for internal flows of classical fluids and for external flows around solid bodies, corresponding there to relations of Burgers, Lighthill, Kambe, Howe and others. All of these prior results employ a background potential Euler flow with the same inflow/outflow as the physical flow, just as in Kelvin's minimum energy theorem, so that the reference potential incorporates information about flow geometry. We here generalize the detailed Josephson-Anderson relation to streamwise periodic channels appropriate for numerical simulation of classical fluid turbulence. We show that the original Neumann b.c. used by Huggins for the background potential create an unphysical vortex sheet in a periodic channel, so that we substitute instead Dirichlet b.c. We show that the minimum energy theorem still holds and our new Josephson-Anderson relation again equates work by pressure drop instantaneously to integrated flux of spanwise vorticity. The result holds for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids and for general curvilinear walls. We illustrate our new formula with numerical results in a periodic channel flow with a single smooth bump, which reveals how vortex separation from the roughness element creates drag at each time instant. Drag and dissipation are thus related to vorticity structure and dynamics locally in space and time, with important applications to drag-reduction and to explanation of anomalous dissipation at high Reynolds numbers.</description>

Abstract: This work provides an exact mathematical characterization of the meniscus formed by a liquid of density $\rho$ (model for tumor tissue) when probed with a cantilever device, operating by gravity (acceleration $g$) and with surface tension coefficient $\sigma$ (material-dependent for the specific choice of liquid and cantilever). The shape and extremal parameters (maximum height $\mathcal{H}$, break-off volume $\mathcal{V}$) of the meniscus formed, as functions of $\sigma, \rho$, are found by an exact analysis. Having knowledge of the explicit relationship between these parameters allows to perform in one procedure both diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Features of the intra-mass buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The buoyancy force is the cause of ordered vertical movements in the atmosphere, therefore, the analysis of the causes and conditions of its formation is important not only for the formation of convective clouds, but also for understanding all atmospheric transport processes. Due to the absence of rigid boundaries inside the gas, a horizontal pressure gradient in a static state cannot exist in the allocated volume. The pressure inside the allocated volume with a different density is equal to the external pressure and the intra-mass buoyancy force, according to its definition, is formally zero. The observed force of intra-mass buoyancy arises due to the difference in vertical pressure gradients in media with different densities. In this case, the buoyancy force is volumetric, and its value corresponds to generally accepted ratios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the low-frequency formulation of the turbulence characterizing the plasma in a Tokamak edge. Under rather natural assumptions we demonstrate that, even in the presence of poloidal magnetic fluctuations, it is possible to deal with a reduced model for the turbulence dynamics. This model relies on a single equation for the electric potential, from which all the physical turbulent properties can be calculated. The main result of the present analysis concerns the existence of a specific Fourier branch for the dynamics which demonstrate the attractive character of the two-dimensional turbulence with respect to non-axisymmetric fluctuations. The peculiar nature of this instability, affecting the non-axially symmetric modes, is discussed in some detail, by recovering two different physical regimes.</description>

      <title>Emergence of order from chaos through a continuous phase transition in a turbulent reactive flow system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the Reynolds number is increased, a laminar fluid flow becomes turbulent, and the range of time and length scales associated with the flow increases. Yet, in a turbulent reactive flow system, as we increase the Reynolds number, we observe the emergence of a single dominant time scale in the acoustic pressure fluctuations, as indicated by its loss of multifractality. Such emergence of order from chaos is intriguing and has hardly been studied. We perform experiments in a turbulent reactive flow system consisting of flame, acoustic, and hydrodynamic subsystems interacting nonlinearly. We study the evolution of short-time correlated dynamics between the acoustic field and the flame in the spatiotemporal domain of the system. The order parameter, defined as the fraction of the correlated dynamics, increases gradually from zero to one. We find that the susceptibility of the order parameter, correlation length, and correlation time diverge at a critical point between chaos and order. Our results show that the observed emergence of order from chaos is a continuous phase transition. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that the critical exponents characterizing this transition fall in the universality class of directed percolation. Our study demonstrates how a real-world complex, non-equilibrium turbulent reactive flow system exhibits universal behavior near a critical point.</description>

      <title>A continuous data assimilation closure for modeling statistically steady turbulence in large-eddy simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closure model is presented for large-eddy simulation (LES) based on the three-dimensional variational data assimilation algorithm. The approach aims at reconstructing high-fidelity kinetic energy spectra in coarse numerical simulations by including feedback control to represent unresolved dynamics interactions in the flow as stochastic processes. The forcing uses statistics obtained from offline high-fidelity data and requires only few parameters compared to the number of degrees of freedom of LES. This modeling strategy is applied to geostrophic turbulence on the sphere and enables simulating indefinitely at reduced costs. It proves to accurately recover the energy spectra and the zonal velocity profiles in the coarse model, for three generic situations.</description>

      <title>Turbulent mixed convection in vertical and horizontal channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent shear flows driven by a combination of a pressure gradient and buoyancy forcing are investigated using direct numerical simulations. Specifically, we consider the setup of a differentially heated vertical channel subject to a Poiseuille-like horizontal pressure gradient. We explore the response of the system to its three control parameters: the Grashof number $Gr$, the Prandtl number $Pr$, and the Reynolds number $Re$ of the pressure-driven flow. From these input parameters, the relative strength of buoyancy driving to the pressure gradient can be quantified by the Richardson number $Ri=Gr/Re^2$. We compare the response of the mixed vertical convection configuration to that of mixed Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and find a nearly identical behaviour, including an increase in wall friction at higher $Gr$ and a drop in the heat flux relative to natural convection for $Ri=O(1)$. This closely matched response is despite vastly different flow structures in the systems. No large-scale organisation is visible in visualisations of mixed vertical convection - an observation that is quantitatively confirmed by spectral analysis. This analysis, combined with a statistical description of the wall heat flux, highlights how moderate shear suppresses the growth of small-scale plumes and reduces the likelihood of extreme events in the local wall heat flux. Vice versa, starting from a pure shear flow, the addition of thermal driving enhances the drag due to the emission of thermal plumes.</description>

      <title>Steady axisymmetric vortices in radial stagnation flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of axisymmetric vortex solutions superposed upon radial stagnation flows is described. The new vortex solutions generalize the classical Burgers' vortex and Sullivan's vortex solutions in the presence of a volumetric line source at the symmetry axis, the former approaching the Burgers' vortex sheet when the source strength becomes very large. The stability of the generalized Burgers' vortex is studied. In a different manner from the classical solution, the generalized Burgers' vortices are found to be unstable for two-dimensional disturbances when the vortex Reynolds number is increased above a critical value, for a fixed strength of the volumetric source.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of solute in straining flows and boundary layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solute dispersion due to an instantaneously released source in steady, laminar, axisymmetric flows with an axial inflow and radial outflow is investigated analytically. Attention is given to large-time characteristics of dispersion, where the concentration reduces in proportion to $e^{-2\lambda \tau}$, where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue that depends on the axial inflow and $\tau$ is the time measured in units of axial-diffusion times. Prospects of some other flows are also considered.</description>

      <title>A note on viscous flow induced by half-line sources bounded by conical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper axisymmetric solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations governing the flow induced by a half-line source when the fluid domain is bounded by a conical wall are discussed. Two types of boundary conditions are identified; one in which the radial velocity along the axis is prescribed, and the other in which the radial velocity along the axis is obtained as an eigenvalue of the problem. The existence of these solutions are limited to a range of Reynolds numbers and the transition from one case to the other are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>A thick reaction zone model for premixed flames in two-dimensional channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct interactions between the flow field and the chemical reaction in premixed flames occur when the reaction zone thickness is comparable to, or greater than flow length scales. To study such interactions, a laminar model is considered that has direct bearings to steadily propagating deflagrations in a Hele-Shaw channel with a background plane Poiseuille flow. The study employs asymptotic analyses, pertaining to large activation energy and lubrication theories and considers a distinguished limit where the channel width is comparable to the reaction zone thickness, with account being taken of thermal-expansion and heat-loss effects. The reaction zone structure and burning rates depend on three parameters, namely, the Peclet number, $\mathcal{P}$, the Lewis number, $Le$ and the ratio of channel half-width to reaction zone thickness, $\lambda_*$. When the parameter $\lambda_*$ is small, transport processes are controlled by Taylor's dispersion mechanism and an explicit formula for the effective burning speed $S_T$ is obtained. The formula indicates that $S_T/S_L \propto 1/Le$ for $\mathcal{P}\gg 1$, which interestingly coincides with a recent experimental prediction of the flame speed in a highly turbulent jet flame. The results suggest that the role played by differential diffusion effects is significant both in laminar and turbulent cases. The reason for the peculiar $1/Le$ dependence can be attributed, in our laminar model, to Taylor dispersion. Presumably, this dependence may be attributed to a similar but more general mechanism in the turbulent case, rather than to diffusive-thermal curvature effects. The latter effects play however an important role in determining the flame speed when $\lambda_*$ is large. The magnitude of heat losses at extinction, is multiplied by a factor $1/Le^2$ in comparison with those corresponding to the no-flow case in narrow channels.</description>

      <title>Positivity-preserving and entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin method for the chemically reacting, compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article concerns the development of a fully conservative, positivity-preserving, and entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the multicomponent, chemically reacting, compressible Navier-Stokes equations with complex thermodynamics. In particular, we extend to viscous flows the fully conservative, positivity-preserving, and entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin method for the chemically reacting Euler equations that we previously introduced. An important component of the formulation is the positivity-preserving Lax-Friedrichs-type viscous flux function devised by Zhang [J. Comput. Phys., 328 (2017), pp. 301-343], which was adapted to multicomponent flows by Du and Yang [J. Comput. Phys., 469 (2022), pp. 111548] in a manner that treats the inviscid and viscous fluxes as a single flux. Here, we similarly extend the aforementioned flux function to multicomponent flows but separate the inviscid and viscous fluxes, resulting in a different dissipation coefficient. This separation of the fluxes allows for use of other inviscid flux functions, as well as enforcement of entropy boundedness on only the convective contribution to the evolved state, as motivated by physical and mathematical principles. We also detail how to account for boundary conditions and incorporate previously developed techniques to reduce spurious pressure oscillations into the positivity-preserving framework. Furthermore, potential issues associated with the Lax-Friedrichs-type viscous flux function in the case of zero species concentrations are discussed and addressed. The resulting formulation is compatible with curved, multidimensional elements and general quadrature rules with positive weights. A variety of multicomponent, viscous flows is computed, ranging from a one-dimensional shock tube problem to multidimensional detonation waves and shock/mixing-layer interaction.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Fine-Tuning and Error Indication for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate modeling has surged in capability in recent years with the emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs), which can operate directly on mesh-based representations of data. The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretable fine-tuning strategy for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. The end result is an enhanced fine-tuned model that isolates regions in physical space, corresponding to sub-graphs, that are intrinsically linked to the forecasting task while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. These structures, identified by the fine-tuned GNNs, are adaptively produced in the forward pass and serve as explainable links between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the fine-tuned GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow field data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers, with geometry extrapolations demonstrated for ramp and wall-mounted cube configurations.</description>
