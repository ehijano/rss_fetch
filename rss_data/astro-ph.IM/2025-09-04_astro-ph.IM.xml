      <title>Radio Astronomy in the Era of Vision-Language Models: Prompt Sensitivity and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as recent Qwen and Gemini models, are positioned as general-purpose AI systems capable of reasoning across domains. Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models. These results suggest that the apparent "reasoning" of VLMs often reflects prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Needlets and foreground removal for SKAO hydrogen intensity maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity Mapping (IM) of the 21-cm line of the neutral hydrogen (\textsc{Hi}) has become a compelling new technique to map the large-scale structure of the Universe. One of the main challenges is the presence of strong foreground emissions of several orders of magnitude larger than the \textsc{Hi}~signal. Here, we implement a version of the Principal Component Analysis, a blind component-separation technique, based on a kind of spherical wavelets called needlets. These functions exploit double localization both in real and in harmonic space. We test Need-PCA performances on a set of maps that simulates the SKA MID radio telescope in the AA4 configuration. We compare our results with other component separation methods such as Generalised Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA) and Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC). All the methods have comparable results, recovering the \textsc{Hi}~signal within 10\% accuracy across the frequency channels, in the multipole range 30 $\lesssim \ell \lesssim$ 136. We also test our pipeline in the presence of systematics such as polarization leakage. We find that the cleaning methods are insensitive to the presence of such systematic, yielding the same results as in the leakage-free case.</description>

      <title>Revised classification of the CHIME fast radio bursts with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short-duration and energetic radio transients of unknown origin. Observationally, they are commonly categorized into repeaters and non-repeaters. However, this binary classification may be influenced by observational limitations such as sensitivity and time coverage of telescopes. In this work, we employ unsupervised machine learning techniques to re-examine the CHIME/FRB catalog, with the goal of identifying intrinsic groupings in the FRB population without relying on preassigned labels. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) for clustering, we find that the FRB sample separates naturally into two major clusters. One cluster contains nearly all known repeaters but is contaminated by some apparently non-repeaters, while the other cluster is dominated by non-repeaters. This suggests that certain FRBs previously labeled as non-repeaters may share intrinsic similarities with repeaters. The mutual information analysis reveals that rest-frame frequency width and peak frequency are the most informative features governing the clustering structure. Even when reducing the input space to just these two features, the classification remains robust.</description>

      <title>On the synergetic use of Ariel and JWST for exoplanet atmospheric science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper explores the potential for strategic synergies between the JWST and the Ariel telescopes, two flagship observatories poised to revolutionise the study of exoplanet atmospheres. Both telescopes have the potential to address common fundamental questions about exoplanets-especially concerning their nature and origins-and serve a growing scientific community. With their operations now anticipated to overlap, starting from 2030, there is a unique opportunity to enhance the scientific outputs of both observatories through coordinated efforts.
  In this report, authored by the Ariel-JWST Synergy Working Group, part of the Ariel Consortium Science Team, we summarise the capabilities of JWST and Ariel; we highlight their key differences, similarities, synergies, and distinctive strengths. Ariel is designed to conduct a broad survey of exoplanet atmospheres but remains highly flexible, allowing the mission to integrate insights from JWST's discoveries. Findings from JWST, including data from initiatives shaped by NASA's decadal survey priorities and community-driven research themes, will inform the development of Ariel's core survey strategy. Conversely, Ariel's ability to perform broad-wavelength coverage observations for bright targets provides complementary avenues for exoplanet researchers, particularly those interested in time-domain observations and large-scale atmospheric studies.
  This paper identifies key pathways for fostering JWST-Ariel synergies, many of which can be initiated even before Ariel's launch. Leveraging their complementary designs and scopes, JWST and Ariel can jointly address fundamental questions about the nature, formation, and evolution of exoplanets. Such strategic collaboration has the potential to maximise the scientific returns of both observatories and lay the foundation for future facilities in the roadmap to exoplanet exploration.</description>

      <title>A Striking First Impression: CGI Commissioning Observations of the AB Aurigae Protoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For one of the first set of Roman Coronagraph project images, we propose to target AB Aurigae. AB Aurigae is a complex and visually stunning system, surrounded by a gas rich protoplanetary disk showing numerous spiral arms, an enigmatic embedded protoplanet (AB Aurigae b) at 0\farcs{}6 separation, and hints of potential additional sites of planet formation. Even a marginally-successful dark hole generation (e.g. 10$^{-5}$--10$^{-6}$ contrast) with CGI would yield a vastly improved view of AB Aur b at optical wavelengths where current ground-based and HST data struggle to yield a high SNR detection and parameters (astrometry, photometry) unbiased by processing artifacts. Total intensity imaging and polarimetry together will provide new constraints on the disk's dust properties and the range of emission sources for AB Aur b. AB Aur images with the Roman Coronagraph will provide a striking, inspiring demonstrations of the instrument's power and promise for detecting fainter planets and disks.</description>

      <title>A Diagnostic Kit for Optical Emission Lines Shaped by Accretion Disc Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blueshifted absorption is the classic spectroscopic signature of an accretion disc wind in X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, outflows can also create pure emission lines, especially at optical wavelengths. Therefore, developing other outflow diagnostics for these types of lines is worthwhile. With this in mind, we construct a systematic grid of 3645 synthetic wind-formed H-alpha line profiles for CVs with the radiative transfer code SIROCCO. Our grid yields a variety of line shapes: symmetric, asymmetric, single- to quadruple-peaked, and even P-Cygni profiles. About 20% of these lines -- our `Gold' sample -- have strengths and widths consistent with observations. We use this grid to test a recently proposed method for identifying wind-formed emission lines based on deviations in the wing profile shape: the `excess equivalent width diagnostic diagram'. We find that our `Gold' sample can preferentially populate the suggested `wind regions' of this diagram. However, the method is highly sensitive to the adopted definition of the line profile `wing'. Hence, we propose a refined definition based on the full-width at half maximum to improve the interpretability of the diagnostic diagram. Furthermore, we define an approximate scaling relation for the strengths of wind-formed CV emission lines in terms of the outflow parameters. This relation provides a fast way to assess whether -- and what kind of -- outflow can produce an observed emission line. All our wind-based models are open-source and we provide an easy-to-use web-based tool to browse our full set of H-alpha spectral profiles.</description>

      <title>The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB): 7. design, fabrication, and first light for a self-coherent camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics tasked future space observatories with the goal of detecting and characterizing a large sample of Earth-like exoplanets. To achieve this, these observatories will require coronagraphs and wavefront control algorithms in order to achieve $10^{-10}$ or better starlight suppression. The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) is a vacuum compatible testbed at the University of Arizona which aims to advance and mature starlight suppression technologies in a space-like environment. In its current configuration, SCoOB is a charge-6 vector vortex coronagraph outfitted with a Kilo-C microelectromechanical systems deformable mirror capable of achieving sub-$10^{-8}$ dark hole contrast at visible wavelengths using implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC). In this work, we demonstrate the use of a self-coherent camera (SCC) for dark hole digging and maintenance on SCoOB. The SCC introduces a small off-axis pinhole in the Lyot plane which allows some starlight to reach the focal plane and interfere with residual speckles. This enables high-order focal-plane wavefront sensing which can be combined with active wavefront control to null the speckles in a specified region of high contrast known as the dark hole. We discuss considerations for implementation, potential limitations, and provide a performance comparison with iEFC. We also discuss the design optimization and fabrication process for our SCC Lyot stops.</description>

      <title>The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB): 8. end-to-end numerical modeling of the testbed to estimate the contrast limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space coronagraph optical bench (SCoOB) at the University of Arizona is a high-contrast imaging testbed designed to operate in a vacuum to obtain a contrast better than 1e-8 in optical wavelengths using vector vortex coronagraph (VVC) masks. The testbed performance in a half-sided D-shaped dark hole is 2.2e-9 in a &lt;&lt; 1% BW, 4e-9 in a 2% BW, and 2.5e-8 in a 15% BW. While the testbed has met the design specification contrast requirements in monochromatic wavelengths, comprehensive end-to-end numerical modeling to assess contrast limits across different bandpasses has yet to be conducted. In this work, we discuss the results of numerical modeling for the SCoOB testbed in both monochromatic and 10% bandwidths at 525 nm and 630 nm. This modeling incorporates measured VVC retardance, modeled polarization aberrations, measured surface and reflectivity errors, and diffuse and surface reflectivity. We explore and discuss the various factors contributing to the contrast limits.</description>

      <title>Optical design and polarimetric performance of a SmallSat UV polarimeter to study interstellar dust: PUFFINS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polarimetry in the Ultraviolet to Find Features in INterStellar dust (PUFFINS) is a SmallSat mission concept designed to obtain ultraviolet (UV) spectropolarimetric observations to probe the interstellar dust grain properties and to understand wavelength-dependent extinction and star formation. PUFFINS plans to observe 70 UV bright target stars at varying distances within a 180-320 nm wavelength range with 0.02% polarimetric accuracy. PUFFINS uses a simple telescope design with all reflective optics coated with protected aluminum to enhance reflectivity in the UV. The telescope and the spectropolarimeter, which consists of a Wollaston prism and a half-wave retarder, have been carefully selected to be greater than Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6). The telescope is designed to exhibit negligible instrumental polarization and crosstalk, significantly reducing the time needed for polarimetric calibration in orbit. The optimum and careful selection of the target stars will enable PUFFINS to observe an expanded and well-defined sample to test the predictions by interstellar grain alignment theory in the observation phase of 9 months. This paper outlines the details of the optical and optomechanical design and evaluates the polarimetric performance of PUFFINS.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Sky Survey Schedule (SSS) framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fulfill the requirements of space object cataloging and enable automated intelligent responses to anomalous events, we designed a novel observation scheduling system named Sky Survey Schedule (SSS). This framework facilitates coordinated operations across multi-site observational networks comprising dozens of instruments, while simultaneously supporting asteroid monitoring and time-domain astronomy studies. The system implements two principal observation modes: fixed sky regions and target-centered tracking. The former is used for sidereal or static observation, while the latter provides dedicated follow-up capabilities for transient targets. The sky regions are divided into latitude bands, each of which is subdivided into sectors to ensure minimal overlap and comprehensive coverage. These sectors are mapped to high-level HEALPix sky grids, enabling rapid cross-referencing and correlation between instruments. At the core of SSS lies an adaptive weighting architecture that integrates multiple parameters. Initial target priorities are determined from orbital catalogs containing both known and uncorrelated objects according to cataloging requirements. The system implements dynamic weight adjustments through feedback mechanisms: confirmed stable objects receive decaying weights, long-unobserved targets experience weight recovery, while anomalies (e.g., newly detected or lost objects) trigger priority escalation. These target-specific weights combine with observational factors - including phase angle constraints, lunar interference, Earth shadowing, and elevation limits - to generate space-time priority matrices. This quantitative framework systematically incorporates operator-defined priorities for specific regions/targets through configurable weight modifiers. Observation plans are dynamically optimized considering:....</description>

      <title>The Future of Artificial Intelligence and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences (AI+MPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS), which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains (Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics) can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS.</description>

      <title>Multi-band Spectral and Astrometric Characterization of the HIP 99770 b Planet with SCExAO/CHARIS and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze follow-up, higher resolution ($R$ $\sim$ 70) $H$ and $K$ band integral field spectroscopy of the superjovian exoplanet HIP 99770 b with SCExAO/CHARIS. Our new data recover the companion at a high signal-to-noise ratio in both bandpasses and more than double the astrometric baseline for its orbital motion. Jointly modeling HIP 99770 b's position and the star's astrometry from \textit{Hipparcos} and \textit{Gaia} yields orbital parameters consistent with those from the discovery paper, albeit with smaller errors, and a slight preference for a smaller semimajor axis ($\sim$15.7--15.8 au)and a larger eccentricity ($\sim$0.28--0.29), disfavoring a circular orbit. We revise its dynamical mass slightly downwards to 15.0$_{-4.4}^{+4.5}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a flat prior and 13.1$_{-5.2}^{+4.8}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a more standard log-uniform mass prior, where the inclusion of its relative radial-velocity measurement is primarily responsible for these changes. \textcolor{red}{We find consistent results for HIP 99770 b's dynamical mass including recent VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry, albeit with a slightly smaller, better constrained eccentricity of $e$ $\sim$ 0.22$^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$}. HIP 99770 b is a $\sim$ 1300 K object at the L/T transition with a gravity intermediate between that of the HR 8799 planets and older, more massive field brown dwarfs with similar temperatures but with hints of equilibrium chemistry. HIP 99770 b is particularly well suited for spectroscopic follow up with Roman CGI during the technology demonstration phase at 730 nm to further constrain its metallicity and chemistry; JWST thermal infrared observations could likewise explore the planet's carbon chemistry, metallicity, and clouds.</description>

Abstract: The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission to study the Jovian system, currently undergoing an eight-year cruise phase. The Planetary Radio Interferometric and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) is one of eleven experiments contributing to the JUICE mission. PRIDE aims to conduct radio science experiments using ground-based radio telescopes, through both single dish and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. The University of Tasmania (UTAS) is an important contributor to PRIDE and JUICE, though its continental-wide network of radio telescopes in Australia. Over 35 PRIDE observations of JUICE were conducted during the period 2023-24, which enabled detailed analysis of space weather activity in this period, as well as the Lunar-Earth flyby campaign in August 2024. In this paper, we describe PRIDE VLBI observations of JUICE, and the first successful results of PRIDE with the University of Tasmania infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Neutron star envelopes with machine learning: a single-hidden-layer neural network application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal and magneto-thermal simulations are an important tool for advancing understanding of neutron stars, as they allow us to compare models of their internal structure and physical processes against observations constraining macroscopic properties such as the surface temperature. A major challenge in the simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope, exhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a geometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate envelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between the temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface temperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for approximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies from the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard prescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be used as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast evaluation necessary in neutron star simulations. We explored the optimal network architecture and hyperparameter choices and used a special holdout set designed to avoid overfitting to the structure of the input data. We find that relatively simple neural networks are sufficient for the approximation of the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation with an accuracy $\sim 3\%$. The presented workflow can be used in a wide range of problems where simulations are used to construct approximating formulae.</description>

      <title>Machine learning reconstruction of cosmic ray parameters in EAS at HAWC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory comprises 300 water Cherenkov detectors, each equipped with four photomultipliers, located on the Volc\'{a}n Sierra Negra in Mexico at 4,100 masl. This observatory can detect gamma rays in an energy range from 300 GeV to 100 TeV and cosmic rays from 100 GeV to 1 PeV. One of HAWC's primary challenges is characterizing air showers and estimate their physical parameters, a highly complex task due to the nature of the data and the processes involved. Currently, HAWC employs two energy estimators for gamma rays: the ground parameter method and a neural network-based approach. However, for cosmic rays, only the likelihood-based estimator is available. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to achieve more accurate estimation of the physical parameters of cosmic rays. These techniques are explored as an alternative for reconstructing the physical properties of extensive air showers using simulated data aligned with the observatory's configuration. Various models were trained and evaluated through an optimized pipeline and the most effective one was selected as the final implementation after a comprehensive comparison. This approach improves the accuracy of physical parameter estimation, contributing significantly to the detailed characterization of cosmic ray events.</description>

      <title>Optimising reference library selection for reference-star differential imaging of discs with SPHERE/IRDIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of circumstellar discs through high-contrast imaging provides key insights into the history and dynamics of planetary systems. Pole-on discs, especially faint debris discs, are difficult to detect and require careful consideration during post-processing to remove stellar residuals from the data while preserving the disc signal. Reference-star differential imaging (RDI) serves as one of the primary post-processing methods for disc observations. We aim to develop a method of reference frame selection that is optimised for the reduction of pole-on discs. Method: We performed principal component analysis based RDI on seven known disc targets and 20 disc-free targets with varying observational conditions, using reference libraries built from frames preselected to best match different observational, atmospheric, and stellar parameters of the science frames. The contrast of the disc-free reductions was measured, and forward modelling was used to estimate the signal loss from over-subtraction using synthetic pole-on discs with two different widths and four different radii. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the real disc targets was measured. Results: Diverse reference libraries built using subsets of frames that closely matched different parameters achieved the best disc S/N and smallest deviation from the best contrast of each target, outperforming libraries built using a single criterion as a selection metric. Libraries built using frame-to-frame Pearson correlation coefficient alone as a selection criterion achieved the best mean contrast overall. Both selection metrics performed consistently well for all disc radii and observational conditions. We also found that reference libraries built using frames observed close in time to the science frame performed well for discs at small separations, giving the best contrast for ~30% of the targets at a radius of 20px.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Galactic Cosmic Ray Modulation in the Heliosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota &amp; Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. III. Detectability of Giant Exomoons of Wide Separation Giant Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will conduct a Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) to discover bound and free-floating exoplanets using gravitational microlensing. Roman should be sensitive to lenses with mass down to ~ 0.02 $M_{\oplus}$, or roughly the mass of Ganymede. Thus the detection of moons with masses similar to the giant moons in our Solar System is possible with Roman. Measuring the demographics of exomoons will provide constraints on both moon and planet formation. We conduct simulations of Roman microlensing events to determine the effects of exomoons on microlensing light curves, and whether these effects are detectable with Roman. We focus on giant planets from 30 $M_{\oplus}$ to 10 $M_{Jup}$ on orbits from 0.3 to 30 AU, and assume that each planet is orbited by a moon with moon-planet mass ratio from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ and separations from 0.1 to 0.5 planet Hill radii. We find that Roman is sensitive to exomoons, although the number of expected detections is only of order one over the duration of the survey, unless exomoons are more common or massive than we assumed. We argue that changes in the survey strategy, in particular focusing on a few fields with higher cadence, may allow for the detection of more exomoons with Roman. Regardless, the ability to detect exomoons reinforces the need to develop robust methods for modeling triple lens microlensing events to fully utilize the capabilities of Roman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emulators using machine learning techniques have emerged to efficiently generate mock data matching the large survey volume for upcoming experiments, as an alternative approach to large-scale numerical simulations. However, high-fidelity emulators have become computationally expensive as the simulation volume grows to hundreds of megaparsecs. Here, we present a {\it multi-fidelity} emulation of large-scale 21~cm lightcone images from the epoch of reionization, which is realized by applying the {\it few-shot transfer learning} to training generative adversarial networks (GAN) from small-scale to large-scale simulations. Specifically, a GAN emulator is first trained with a huge number of small-scale simulations, and then transfer-learned with only a limited number of large-scale simulations, to emulate large-scale 21~cm lightcone images. We test the precision of our transfer-learned GAN emulator in terms of representative statistics including global 21~cm brightness temperature history, 2D power spectrum, and scattering transform coefficients. We demonstrate that the lightcone images generated by the transfer-learned GAN emulator can reach the percentage level precision in most cases on small scales, and the error on large scales only increases mildly to the level of a few tens of per cent. Nevertheless, our multi-fidelity emulation technique saves a significant portion of computational resources that are mostly consumed for generating training samples for GAN. On estimate, the computational resource by training GAN completely with large-scale simulations would be one to two orders of magnitude larger than using our multi-fidelity technique. This implies that our technique allows for emulating high-fidelity, traditionally computationally prohibitive, images in an economic manner.</description>

Abstract: Recovering high-fidelity images of the night sky from blurred observations is a fundamental problem in astronomy, where traditional methods typically fall short. In ground-based astronomy, combining multiple exposures to enhance signal-to-noise ratios is further complicated by variations in the point-spread function caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.</description>

Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the origin of the heaviest elements on the periodic table, with a focus on those produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy can increase the number of r-process elements detectable in cool stars by more than 50% relative to optical and infrared spectra. These elements are key to characterizing the physical conditions that govern the r-process and identify the nature, sites, and environments where r-process events occurred. HWO has the potential to greatly expand the sample of stars where rarely studied heavy elements can be detected beyond the Solar neighborhood to the Galactic halo, globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the Milky Way and neighboring stellar systems.</description>

Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxy and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.</description>

      <title>How many pixels are there in a polarized pulsar timing array map?</title>

Abstract: The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this way, we describe the full, $S_2 \times S_2$, state-space of a polarized gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\'e sphere describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\rm res} = 16 \times 2 = 32$ per frequency, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\rm pulsar} \gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\sigma$ map significance.</description>

      <title>Anchors no more: Using peculiar velocities to constrain $H_0$ and the primordial Universe without calibrators</title>

Abstract: We develop a novel approach to constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the primordial power spectrum amplitude $A_\mathrm{s}$ using type Ia supernovae (SNIa) data. By considering SNIa as tracers of the peculiar velocity field, we can model their distance and their covariance as a function of cosmological parameters without the need of calibrators like Cepheids; this yields a new independent probe of the large-scale structure based on SNIa data without distance anchors. Crucially, we implement a differentiable pipeline in JAX, including efficient emulators and affine sampling, reducing inference time from years to hours on a single GPU. We first validate our method on mock datasets, demonstrating that we can constrain $H_0$ and $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ within $10\%$ and $15\%$, respectively, using $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ SNIa. We then test our pipeline with SNIa from an $N$-body simulation, obtaining $6\%$-level unbiased constraints on $H_0$ with a moderate noise level. We finally apply our method to Pantheon+ data, constraining $H_0$ at the $15\%$ level without Cepheids when fixing $A_\mathrm{s}$ to its $\it{Planck}$ value. On the other hand, we obtain $20\%$-level constraints on $\log 10^{10}A_\mathrm{s}$ in agreement with $\it{Planck}$ when including Cepheids in the analysis. In light of upcoming observations of low redshift SNIa from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Vera Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, surveys for which our method will develop its full potential, we make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Compiling Exoatmospheric Target Lists And Quantifying the Ground-Based Resources Needed to Vet Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03801</link>

Abstract: Transiting exoplanet atmospheric characterization is currently in a golden age as dozens of exoplanet atmospheres are being studied by NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. This trend is expected to continue with NASA's Pandora Smallsat and Roman Space Telescope and ESA's Ariel mission (all expected to launch within this decade) and NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (expected to launch in the early 2040s) all of which are centered around studying the atmospheres of exoplanets. Here we explore a new approach to constructing large scale exoatmospheric survey lists, which combines the use of traditional transmission/emission spectroscopy figures of merit with a focus on more-evenly sampling planets across a range of radii and equilibrium temperatures. After assembling a sample target list comprised of 750 transmission spectroscopy targets and 150 emission spectroscopy targets, we quantify the potential time lost to stale transit and eclipse ephemerides and find that hundreds of hours of space-based observing could be wasted given current uncertainties in orbital periods, transit epochs, and orbital eccentricities. We further estimate the amount of ground-based telescope time necessary to obtain sufficiently precise exoplanet masses and find that it exceeds 100 nights of 10m telescope time. Based upon these findings, we provide a list of recommendations that would make community efforts for preparation and interpretation of atmospheric characterization endeavors more effective and efficient. The strategies we recommend here can be used to support both current (e.g., HST and JWST) and future exoplanet atmosphere characterization missions (e.g., Pandora, Ariel, Roman, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory).</description>
