      <title>Baseband Modulational Instability and Manifestation of Breather and Super Rogue Wave Phenomena in Modified Noguchi Electrical Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the emergence of breather and super rogue waves in a modified Noguchi electrical transmission line and demonstrate that both phenomena arise from baseband modulational instability. We then systematically examine the influence of three key parameters and time that appear in the solutions, on the structure and behavior of breathers and super rogue waves, how they control waveform amplitude, localization, and intensity. We also explore the intricate dynamics of wave propagation in nonlinear electrical line. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of network parameters, such as inductances, capacitances, and nonlinear coefficients, in shaping wave behavior, offering not only practical guidelines for the design, stability, and experimental investigation of electrical transmission systems but also provides practical approaches for controlling and managing breather and super rogue wave phenomena in the transmission lines.</description>

      <title>Transmission of Positons in a Modified Noguchi Electrical Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous studies, the propagation of localized pulses (solitons, rogue waves and breathers) in electrical transmission lines has been studied. In this work, we extend this study to explore the transmission of positon solutions or positons in the modified Noguchi electrical transmission line model. By converting the circuit equations into the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we identify positons, a special type of solution with algebraic decay and oscillatory patterns. Unlike solitons, which are used for stable energy transmission, positons provide persistent energy localization and controlled spreading over long distances. We consider second-order and third-order positon solutions and examine their transmission behaviour in electrical lines. We show that over long times, the amplitude and width of both second- and third-order positons remain largely unaffected, indicating stable transmission. We also analyze what are the parameters affect the amplitude and localization of this kind of waves. Our investigations reveal that the amplitude and localization of positons are significantly influenced by the parameter $\epsilon$ that appear in the solution. Our findings have practical implications for improving energy transmission in electrical systems, where the management of wave localization and dispersion is crucial.</description>

      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, the emergence of chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continues to puzzle scholars, due to its elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order (many-body) interactions greatly enhance the presence of chimera states, which are easier to be found and more persistent. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for its control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape collective behaviors in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Vacuum state perturbed by an oscillon: composite configurations in $\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the evolution of a vacuum configuration when perturbed by an oscillon. We consider the $\phi^4$ scenario with a single scalar field only. For highly excited oscillons, we find that new composite solutions appear. They are formed by multiple antikink-kink pairs and a centered reminiscent oscillon. The overall process gives rise to a resonant structure whose pattern resembles that of a genuine kink-antikink scattering. We then approximate the initial oscillon by a lumplike profile constructed as a kink-antikink pair. We map the numerical results previously obtained. The developments proposed here may contribute to the understanding of the mechanism through which an oscillon decay reproduces the structure typically related to a kink-antikink collision.</description>
