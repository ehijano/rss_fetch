      <title>Probing jet hadrochemistry in Pb--Pb collisions with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet substructure measurements in heavy-ion collisions provide constraints on jet quenching and the medium response in the QGP. Though there has been remarkable progress in inclusive-charged-hadron jet substructure measurements, understanding the identified particle composition of jets and their modification in heavy-ion collisions has proven challenging. Jet quenching models predict that the jet hadrochemical composition may be modified in heavy-ion collisions due to jet-medium interactions, as well as the medium response. Measurements of identified particles in jets can help discriminate between various parton-QGP interactions. We present the first measurements of $\pi$, K, and p ratios within charged-particle-jets, as well as in the underlying event, as a function of particle transverse momentum in pp and Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. These measurements leverage the excellent PID capabilities of ALICE over a wide transverse momentum range. These results aim to understand soft particle production mechanisms and distinguish modified jet fragmentation from bulk effects.</description>

      <title>News on strangeness production from the NA61/SHINE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strangeness production in high-energy hadronic and nuclear collisions continues to be one of the central topics in the study of strongly interacting matter. The data collected by the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS North Area allow for a comprehensive scan of the strangeness production across various collision energies and system sizes.
  This article focuses on the new results of the strangeness production in central collisions of medium-sized nuclei, such as Ar+Sc, at the SPS energy range. In particular, the results for Lambda hyperons and charged and neutral $K$ mesons are shown. The energy and system size dependencies of Lambda-to-pion and strangeness-to-pion ratios are also explored. Moreover, an unexpected excess of charged over neutral $K$ meson production in Ar+Sc and $\pi^-$+C interactions is presented. The obtained results are compared with predictions from selected particle production models, as well as with existing world data from proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>Direct Neutron Reactions in Storage Rings Utilizing a Supercompact Cyclotron Neutron Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for a high-density free-neutron target, primarily aimed at nuclear astrophysics reaction studies in inverse kinematics with radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring. The target concept integrates four key subsystems: a neutron production source driven by a supercompact cyclotron utilizing $^9$Be($p,xn$) reactions, an optimized moderator/reflector assembly using either heavy-water or beryllium oxide with a graphite reflector shell to thermalize fast neutrons, a cryogenic liquid hydrogen moderator to maximize thermal neutron density in the interaction region, and beam pipe geometries that enable neutron-ion interactions while maintaining vacuum conditions for ion circulation. This integrated approach focuses on feasibility by incorporating readily available technology. Using a commercial supercompact cyclotron delivering 130 $\mu$A, the design achieves thermal neutron areal densities of $\sim3.4\times10^{6}$ n/cm$^2$ for a proof-of-concept demonstrator at the CRYRING ion-storage ring at GSI. This autonomous accelerator-target assembly design enables deployment at both in-flight and ISOL facilities to exploit their complementary production yields.
  Potential upgrades based on higher-energy and/or higher-current isochronous cyclotrons should enable an increase in areal density to $\sim$10$^9$ n/cm$^2$. In combination with a customized low-energy storage ring and a radioactive ion-beam facility, the proposed solution could deliver luminosities above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, thereby enabling neutron capture measurements of $\sim$mb cross sections within a few days of experiment. The proposed system represents a significant milestone towards enabling large neutron-capture surveys on exotic nuclei, thereby opening a new avenue for understanding the synthesis of heavy elements in our universe.</description>

      <title>High-precision determination of radiative corrections to superallowed nuclear beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superallowed $0^+\rightarrow 0^+$ transitions between $T=1$ nuclei have been a perfect avenue avenue for determining the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, which imposes powerful constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model at low energies. For a long time, the precision of $V_{ud}$ has been limited by uncertainties in radiative corrections that arise from non-perturbative strong interaction physics at both the hadronic and nuclear levels. In this talk, I will describe some recent efforts to pin down these corrections by combining dispersive analysis with experimental data, lattice QCD, and nuclear many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Light Production in Inorganic Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent experiments, inorganic scintillators have been used to study the decays of exotic nuclei, providing an alternative to silicon detectors and enabling measurements that were previously impossible. However, proper use of these materials requires us to understand and quantify the scintillation process. In this work, we propose a framework based on that of Birks [Proc. Phys. Soc. A 64, 874] and Meyer and Murray [Phys. Rev. 128, 98] to model the light output of inorganic scintillators in response to beams of energetic heavy ions over a broad range of energies. Our model suggests that, for sufficiently heavy ions at high energies, the majority of the light output is associated with the creation of delta electrons, which are induced by the passage of the beam through the material. These delta electrons dramatically impact the response of detection systems when subject to ions with velocities typical of beams in modern fragmentation facilities. We test the accuracy of our model with data from Lutetium Yttrium Orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce), a common inorganic scintillator. We compare calculated light production and quenching factors with experimental data for heavy ions of varying mass and energy as well as make a quantitative estimate of the effects of delta rays on overall light output. The model presented herein will serve as a basic framework for further studies of scintillator response to heavy ions. Our results are crucial in planning future experiments where relativistic exotic nuclei are interacting with scintillator detectors.</description>

      <title>Measurement of light-by-light scattering and the Breit-Wheeler process, and search for axion-like particles in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of light-by-light scattering (LbL, $\gamma\gamma$ $\to$ $\gamma\gamma$) and the Breit-Wheeler process (BW, $\gamma\gamma$ $\to$ $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$) are reported in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.7 nb$^{-1}$, was collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2018. Events with an exclusively produced $\gamma\gamma$ or $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ pair with invariant masses $m^{\gamma\gamma,\mathrm{ee}}$ $&gt;$ 5 GeV, along with other fiducial criteria, are selected. The measured BW fiducial production cross section, $\sigma_\text{fid}$($\gamma\gamma$ $\to$ $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$) = 263.5 $\pm$ 1.8 (stat) $\pm$ 17.8 (syst) $\mu$b, as well as the differential distributions for various kinematic observables, are in agreement with leading-order quantum electrodynamics predictions complemented with final-state photon radiation. The measured differential BW cross sections allow discriminating between different theoretical descriptions of the photon flux of the lead ion. In the LbL final state, 26 exclusive diphoton candidate events are observed compared with 12.0 $\pm$ 2.9 expected for the background. Combined with previous results, the observed significance of the LbL signal with respect to the background-only hypothesis is above five standard deviations. The measured fiducial LbL scattering cross section, $\sigma_\text{fid} (\gamma\gamma$ $\to$ $\gamma\gamma)$ = 107 $\pm$ 24 (stat) $\pm$ 13 (syst) nb, is in agreement with next-to-leading-order predictions. Limits on the production of axion-like particles coupled to photons are set over the mass range 5-100 GeV, including the most stringent limits to date in the range of 5-10 GeV.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements complete up to N$^2$LO in heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate all nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) up to next-to-next-to leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) for the neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of the nuclei most relevant for experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{100}$Mo, and $^{136}$Xe. We use the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) and the nuclear shell model to calculate the N$^2$LO NMEs from very low-momentum (ultrasoft) neutrinos and from loop diagrams usually neglected in $0\nu\beta\beta$ studies. Our results indicate that the overall N$^2$LO contribution is centered around $-(5$-$10)\%$ for the shell model and $+(10$-$15)\%$ for the pnQRPA, with sizable uncertainties due to the scale dependence of the ultrasoft NMEs and the short-range nature of the loop NMEs. The sign discrepancy between many-body methods is common to all studied nuclei and points to the different behaviour of the intermediate states of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Within uncertainties, our results for the ultrasoft NME are of similar size as contributions usually referred to as ``beyond the closure approximation''.</description>

      <title>Structure of the doubly magic nuclei $^{208}$Pb and $^{266}$Pb from ab initio computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies indicate that the superheavy neutron-rich nucleus $^{266}_{\ 82}$Pb$_{184}$ is doubly magic and at the neutron drip line. While its density distributions and single-particle energies have been computed, the structure of this nucleus is yet unknown. We perform ab initio computations of $^{266}$Pb using an interaction from an effective field theory of quantum chromodynamics tuned only on properties of nuclei with $A \leq 4$. We validate our theoretical framework by computing the first $2^+$ and $3^-$ excited states of $^{208}$Pb, finding agreement with experimental data. We confirm that $^{266}$Pb is doubly magic and show that its $3^-$ state, located below the $2^+$ state, exhibits an excitation gap of 2.6 MeV with respect to the ground state. Our calculations also suggest that this nucleus is at the neutron drip line.</description>
