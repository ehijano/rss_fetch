      <title>KL Dra as a Benchmark Laboratory for Accretion-Disk Physics: Constraints from TESS and Ground-Based Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the longest-term optical analysis of the AM CVn system KL Dra using $\sim11$ years of monitoring from TESS and wide-field ground-based surveys. The continuous TESS coverage allows us to characterise its frequent outbursts with unprecedented detail, providing the first comprehensive study of an AM CVn during outbursts and enabling detailed modelling of these systems. The superoutbursts in KL Dra generally include a precursor, and are followed by a series of rebrightenings after which a sequence of 3-4 large amplitude normal outbursts is observed. We fit parametric profiles to each superoutburst component (precursor, rise to plateau, plateau, decay), to rebrightenings, and to normal outbursts, which let us quantify every high state feature and investigate correlations with the system's long term supercyle evolution. Our continuous coverage reveals an average value for the supercycles, superoutbursts and normal outbursts of $60.4 \pm 0.1$ d, $5.67\pm0.03$ d and $1.17 \pm0.01$ d, respectively. The supercycle duration may be correlated with the rebrightenings duration and superoutburst amplitude, and anticorrelated with the plateau length. Within a supercycle, normal outbursts grow in amplitude and duration, and the first normal outburst is usually highly asymmetric, while subsequent normal outbursts are more symmetric. We detected superhumps in TESS superoutbursts but not in the rebrightenings or normal outbursts. We interpret the results within the disk instability model, considering additional effects, such as changes in the donor mass transfer rate.</description>

      <title>Polarization of decayless kink oscillations in a 3D MHD coronal loop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decayless kink oscillations are frequently observed in solar coronal loops and are considered potential contributors to coronal heating. Despite the ubiquity of this wave phenomenon, its driving mechanism remains unclear. Studies to derive the polarization state of these oscillations, which would be a key to identifying the drivers, have been limited due to observational constraints. We analyze a 3D MHD simulation of coronal loops using the MURaM code. Synthetic extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission maps, combined with velocity diagnostics, are used to identify and characterize transverse wave motions in the simulated loop structures. This is the first demonstration of decayless kink waves emerging self-consistently in a 3D MHD loop-in-a-box model. The simulation produces persistent, low-amplitude, decayless kink oscillations that closely match observed properties. These oscillations arise spontaneously, without any imposed periodic driver, and exhibit clear linear polarization with oscillation planes not aligned to the principal axes. The observed coherency of linear polarization with oscillation cycles favors a self-sustained or quasi-steady type wave driver over a stochastic or broadband source.</description>

      <title>Empirical Evidence of Planetary Group Configurations Modulating Solar Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our prior research found that a $90^{\circ}$ configuration of two planetary groups were temporally associated with significant changes in global electromagnetic standing waves (Schumann resonances) during and after the three $90^{\circ}$ configuration events occurring in late 2017 and early 2018. Specifically noted were reductions in variability moving into an event and level changes immediately after a event. Because global standing-wave data have a short history and no $90^{\circ}$ events have occurred since that period, we examine here whether these geometric configuration events correspond to similar signatures in the long sunspot count record. Using daily sunspot data from January 1935 through December 2024, we conducted empirical studies assessing variance changes, post-event level shifts, and potential intrinsic oscillatory structure. In Study A, a variance-ratio test showed that sunspot variability was systematically lower during the events than in the preceding period, with 21 of 26 events since 1935 exhibiting reduced variance (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study B, solar activity level declined roughly 21 days after events ended, with 21 of 26 events showing negative changes (binomial $p=0.0025$). In Study C, wavelet and filtering analyses revealed no internal solar oscillations at comparable timescales. These findings provide empirical evidence that the configuration events are associated with shifts in solar activity. The next three configuration events in mid- and late-2026 offer an opportunity to assess these patterns in real time.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of a sample of RV Tauri stars without IR excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed high-resolution optical spectra of 11 RV Tauri stars without IR excess, with the primary goal of searching for chemical depletion patterns. Using equivalent widths of absorption lines, we calculated photospheric parameters and chemical element abundances for five stars in the sample: HD 172810, V399 Cyg, AA Ari, V457 Cyg, and V894 Per. Only the abundance pattern of V457 Cyg suggests depletion. In the spectrum of this star, TiO lines are also observed in emission in addition to metal emissions. V457 Cyg is likely a binary system that was once surrounded by a circumbinary disc. In the spectrum of V894 Per, we find a set of spectral lines that appear to belong to another star, corroborating that it is an eclipsing variable rather than an RV Tauri star. The high overabundance of sodium may result from mass transfer within the binary system.</description>

      <title>The effect of metallicity on the Leavitt Law using phase-dependent properties of classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absolute calibration of period-luminosity (PL) relations of Cepheids in the Milky Way (MW) and its nearby galaxies has been a cornerstone in determining extragalactic distances and the current local expansion rate of the Universe. However, the universality of PL relations is still debated; particularly, the metallicity effect on the Cepheid PL relation. Due to the HIF-stellar photosphere interactions in Cepheids, different period-color (PC) relations at different phases can influence the corresponding PL relations at those phases.We have considered the PL relations at multiple pulsation phases as they capture the ensemble radiation hydrodynamic properties at those phases. We investigate the effect of metallicity on PL relations based on multiphase analysis of classical Cepheid light curves in the MW, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Multiphase metallicity coefficients $(\gamma)$ are derived in five different photometric bands ($V$, $I$, $G$, $G_{\rm BP}$, $G_{\rm RP}$) and two Wesenheit indices ($W_{VI}$, $W_{G}$). We show that the coefficients of multiphase period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations vary dynamically as functions of Cepheid pulsation phases over a complete pulsation cycle. We find significant differences in the $\gamma_{\lambda}$ values between the short- $(0.4 \leq \log{P} &lt; 1)$ and long-period $(1 \leq \log{P} &lt; 2)$ Cepheids at multiple phases, in two bands, $G_{\rm RP}$ and $W_{G}$. The weighted averages of the multiphase $\gamma_{\lambda}$ values are found to be in good agreement with the latest results published in the literature. Our methods and results provide new insights into the metallicity effect on the Leavitt law, which can be useful in constraining pulsation models. Additionally, this study shows that the metallicity effect on mean-light PL relations can be recovered from its phase-dependent nature found in this study.</description>

      <title>Three-equation turbulent convection models in classical variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Turbulent convection models in nonlinear radial stellar pulsation models rely on an extra equation for turbulent kinetic energy and fail to adequately explain mode-selection problems. Since multidimensional calculations are computationally expensive, it is reasonable to search for generalizations of physically grounded 1D models that approximate multidimensional results with sufficient accuracy, at least in a given parameter range. A natural way of progressing from one-equation models is to use additional nonlocal equations. While these types of models also exist in the literature, they have not been adopted for this type of object.
  Aims. We aim to adapt the three-equation turbulent convection model from Kuhfuss to radial stellar pulsation modeling.
  Methods. We use a Reynolds-stress one-point closure approach to derive our extensions alongside the model, while using additional models from the literature to close the anisotropy and dissipation terms.
  Results. We provide five extensions to the original model. These include an enhanced dissipation correction to the mixing length, a local anisotropy model replacing eddy viscosity, a second-order correction for turbulent ion transport in the atmosphere (alongside opacity effects), and turbulent damping of entropy fluctuations and convective flux.</description>

      <title>Mutual Orbit Alignment in Resolved Triple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sample of 278 triple systems with outer separations under 300 au and resolved inner pairs is studied, focusing on the mutual alignment between inner and outer orbits. The degree of alignment increases with (i) decreasing outer separation, (ii) decreasing ratio of outer and inner separations, (iii) decreasing mass of the inner primary component, and (iv) increasing inner mass ratio. There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ~40deg for the full sample and ~10deg for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 solar and outer separations below 50 au. Inner eccentricities in aligned triples are smaller compared to misaligned ones. In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20deg, while the rest are aligned randomly. These findings match qualitatively current understanding of the formation of hierarchical systems, where the N-body dynamics dominates at large scales, while the accretion and migration shape systems closer than $\sim$100 au. Fragmentation of isolated cores apparently produces approximately aligned low-mass hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Energetic particles accelerated via turbulent magnetic reconnection in protoplanetary discs -- I: ionisation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionisation controls the chemistry, thermal balance, and magnetic coupling in protoplanetary discs. However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in-situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $\kappa$. For $\kappa\gtrsim 0.4\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard sources like X-rays and GCRs in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of AU. Even at $\kappa\sim 0.025\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. EP-induced heating complements UV/X-ray heating in the atmosphere and persists deeper. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical and dynamical models of protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Addressing Known Challenges in Solar Flare Forecasting I: Limb-Flare Prediction with a 4-pi Full-Heliosphere Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A demonstrated failure mode for operational solar flare forecasting is the inability to forecast flares that occur near, or just beyond, the solar limb. To address this shortcoming, we develop a "4pi" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a "visibility" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far ("invisible" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or "missed" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources.</description>

      <title>A New Bayesian Framework with Natural Priors to Constrain the Neutron Star Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new Bayesian framework to infer the neutron star equation of state (EOS) from mass and radius observations and neutron matter theory by defining priors that directly parameterize mass-radius space instead of pressure-energy density space. We use direct and accurate inversion approximations to map mass-radius relations to the underlying EOS. We systematically compare its EOS inferences with those inferred from traditional EOS parameterizations, taking care to quantify the systematic prior uncertainties of both. Our results show that prior uncertainties should be included in all Bayesian approaches. The more natural alternative framework provides broader coverage of the physically allowed mass-radius space, especially small radius configurations, and yields enhanced computational efficiency and substantially reduced dependence on prior choices. Our results demonstrate that direct parameterization in observed space offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Robotic Telescopes on Time-Domain Astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of time-domain astronomy has experienced unprecedented growth due to the increasing deployment of robotic telescopes capable of autonomous, round-the-clock sky monitoring. These instruments have revolutionized the detection and characterization of transient phenomena such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, variable stars, and gravitational wave counterparts. This paper explores the transformative role of robotic telescopes such as ZTF, ATLAS, and LCOGT in enabling rapid-response observations and building large time-series datasets. We review the design principles and scheduling algorithms behind robotic observatories and assess their scientific contributions across different wavelength regimes. Particular attention is given to the synergy between robotic systems and machine learning pipelines that enable real-time classification of transient events. We also discuss challenges such as data deluge, follow-up prioritization, and observational biases, as well as future directions in global telescope networks</description>

      <title>Formation of Recycled Pulsars in Common Envelope Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (L/IMXBs) consisting of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star (NS) and a donor star of mass $1-8\,M_{\odot}$. Using grids of detailed MESA simulations, we show that for donor masses of $2-8\,M_{\odot}$, mass transfer may be dynamically unstable, leading to a common envelope (CE) phase. By adopting CE ejection efficiencies in the range $\alpha_{\rm CE} = 0.3-3.0$, we find that post-CE binaries frequently experience a CE decoupling phase (CEDP), which plays a critical role in determining their final orbital and compositional properties. Systems with initial donor masses $\gtrsim 3.5\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly evolve into NS binaries with carbon-oxygen or oxygen-neon white dwarfs (WDs) with masses between $0.5\,M_{\odot}$ and $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. Comparison with the observed population of binary pulsars with a WD companion shows better agreement with higher CE ejection efficiencies ($\alpha_{\rm CE} = 3.0$). Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSs can accrete a sufficient amount of matter ($\gtrsim 0.01\,M_{\odot}$) during the CEDP and subsequent Case BA/BB/BC mass transfer phases to be effectively recycled into millisecond pulsars. We identify two distinct evolutionary channels capable of reproducing the observed characteristics of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1928+1815 with a helium-star companion. Our results highlight the importance of the CEDP in the formation of recycled pulsars and provide constraints on the CE ejection efficiency during binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Investigating the High-energy Radiation Environment of Planets in Sun-like Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is a driving source of photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $\alpha$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 {\AA}, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 {\AA}--1 mm for both $\alpha$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $\alpha$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Rapid emergence of overmassive black holes in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a long-standing problem in astrophysics. Recent JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of overmassive black holes at z&gt;4-6, where the BH masses lie far above local scaling relations and not reproduced by current cosmological models. How such overmassive black holes form and rapidly grow within young galaxies has remained unclear. Here we present fully cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that, for the first time, self-consistently follow the birth, early growth, and emergent observable signatures of SMBHs in proto-cluster environments. We find that heavy seeds of order $10^6 M_\text{sun}$ naturally form, exceeding typical theoretical expectations by an order of magnitude. These seeds rapidly develop dense, optically thick disks whose strong electron scattering produces broad H$\alpha$ emission comparable to that seen in little red dots (LRDs). Sustained super-Eddington accretion then drives fast growth to $\sim 3 \times 10^7 ~M_\text{sun}$ by $z \sim 8$. These results provide a unified physical scenario in which LRDs correspond to a short-lived, enshrouded phase of heavy-seed formation, naturally evolving into the overmassive quasars detected by JWST and ultimately the progenitors of today's SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Extreme Solar Flare Prediction Using Residual Networks with HMI Magnetograms and Intensitygrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar flares, especially C, M, and X class, pose significant risks to satellite operations, communication systems, and power grids. We present a novel approach for predicting extreme solar flares using HMI intensitygrams and magnetograms. By detecting sunspots from intensitygrams and extracting magnetic field patches from magnetograms, we train a Residual Network (ResNet) to classify extreme class flares. Our model demonstrates high accuracy, offering a robust tool for predicting extreme solar flares and improving space weather forecasting. Additionally, we show that HMI magnetograms provide more useful data for deep learning compared to other SDO AIA images by better capturing features critical for predicting flare magnitudes. This study underscores the importance of identifying magnetic fields in solar flare prediction, marking a significant advancement in solar activity prediction with practical implications for mitigating space weather impacts.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Global Solar Convection with a Fully Compressible CHORUS++ Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid-dynamics simulations of global solar convection are a critically important tool for assessing the dynamics of the solar interior. However, simulation studies with a fully compressible hydrodynamics code are not yet common. The CHORUS++ code solves robustly and efficiently the fully compressible hydrodynamics equations using a compact local spectral method and semi-unstructured grid system. Using the CHORUS++ code, we simulate the solar interior plasma flows from 0.7 to 0.99 of the solar radius using the values of the solar total luminosity and the sidereal rotation rate. In this paper, we analyze the simulated global flow structures before the statistically stable state to assess the compressibility of the plasma flows obtained with the fully compressible hydrodynamic code. The divergence of mass flux with the compressible model is overall small in the examined state before reaching the equilibrium state of the convection, which implies that the differences between the fully compressible flows and those obtained with the anelastic, incompressible, or linear-equation models are small in the simulated inner part of the convection zone. Although a fully-relaxed stationary convection has not been achieved yet in the examined state, the model qualitatively reproduces the solar-type differential rotation. Simulations for longer periods are needed to achieve the system relaxation state. This work, assessing the early phase of the hydrodynamic evolution of solar convection, is our first step toward a better understanding of the nature of solar convection and the dynamo processes.</description>

      <title>The Preliminary Mauve Science Programme: Science themes identified for the first year of operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mauve is a low-cost small satellite developed and operated by Blue Skies Space Ltd. The payload features a 13 cm telescope connected with a fibre that feeds into a UV-Vis spectrometer. The detector covers the 200-700 nm range in a single shot, obtaining low resolution spectra at R~20-65. Mauve has launched on 28th November 2025, reaching a 510 km Low-Earth Sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite will enable UV and visible observations of a variety of stellar objects in our Galaxy, filling the gaps in the ultraviolet space-based data. The researchers that have already joined the mission have defined the science themes, observational strategy and targets that Mauve will observe in the first year of operations. To date, 10 science themes have been developed by the Mauve science collaboration for year 1, with observational strategies that include both long duration monitoring and short cadence snapshots. Here, we describe these themes and the science that Mauve will undertake in its first year of operations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Simultaneous Stellar Modeling Uncertainties on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch for Axion-Election Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for incorporating the effects of stellar modeling uncertainties into constraints on the axion-electron coupling constant found using the observed calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) I band magnitude $M_I$.~We simulate grids of models with varying initial stellar mass, helium abundance, metallicity, and axion-electron coupling $\alpha_{26}= 10^{26} g^2_{ae}/4\pi$ but different (fixed) mixing lengths and mass loss efficiencies.~We then train separate machine learning emulators to predict $M_I$ as a function of the varying parameters for each grid.~Our emulators enable the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations where $\alpha_{26}$ is varied simultaneously with the stellar parameters.~One of our grids yields a bound $\alpha_{26}\leq 0.75$ at the 95\% confidence limit, a factor of $\sim3.7$ weaker than previous bounds;~while the other grid yields $\alpha_{26}\leq1.58$ at the 95\% confidence limit, a factor $\sim7.8$ weaker than previous bounds.~We demonstrate that the different values we find are due to covariances between stellar and axion physics that are not accounted for by single parameter variations.~Our results suggest that the bound on $\alpha_{26}$ derived using empirical calibrations of the TRGB I band magnitude need to be reevaluated using simultaneous parameter variation.~Alternative methods that use the bolometric luminosity instead of $M_I$ are more robust because they are not reliant upon theoretical predictions of the effective temperature.</description>

      <title>Probing the Axion-Nucleon Coupling with Supergiant Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finite axion-nucleon coupling enables the production of axions in stellar environments via the thermal excitation and subsequent de-excitation of the $^{57}$Fe isotope. Given its low-lying excited state at 14.4 keV, $^{57}$Fe can be efficiently excited in the hot cores of supergiant stars, possibly leading to axions emission. The conversion of these axions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field results in a characteristic 14.4 keV line, potentially detectable by hard X-ray telescopes such as NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). In this work, we present the first constraints on axion-nucleon couplings derived from \textsc{NuSTAR} observations of Betelgeuse and discuss the potential insights that could be gained from detecting this line in other nearby supergiants. Our results establish significantly more stringent bounds than those obtained from solar observations, setting a limit of $|g_{a\gamma} g_{aN}^{\mathrm{eff}}| &lt; (1.2 - 2.7) \times 10^{-20}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Investigating Circumstellar Atomic Radiation-driven Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactions between stars and their orbiting planets, driven by forces such as stellar radiation and gravity, play an essential role in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres and gas-rich debris discs. One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.</description>

      <title>Bridging stellar evolution and planet formation: from birth, to survivors of the fittest, to the second generation of planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.</description>

      <title>A framework for LISA population inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>
