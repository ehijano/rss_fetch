      <title>Oracle Separations for the Quantum-Classical Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum-classical polynomial hierarchy, QCPH, which is the class of languages solvable by a constant number of alternating classical quantifiers followed by a quantum verifier. Our main result is that QCPH is infinite relative to a random oracle (previously, this was not even known relative to any oracle). We further prove that higher levels of PH are not contained in lower levels of QCPH relative to a random oracle; this is a strengthening of the somewhat recent result that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle (Rossman, Servedio, and Tan 2016).
  The oracle separation requires lower bounding a certain type of low-depth alternating circuit with some quantum gates. To establish this, we give a new switching lemma for quantum algorithms which may be of independent interest. Our lemma says that for any $d$, if we apply a random restriction to a function $f$ with quantum query complexity $\mathrm{Q}(f)\le n^{1/3}$, the restricted function becomes exponentially close (in terms of $d$) to a depth-$d$ decision tree. Our switching lemma works even in a "worst-case" sense, in that only the indices to be restricted are random; the values they are restricted to are chosen adversarially. Moreover, the switching lemma also works for polynomial degree in place of quantum query complexity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Merlin-Arthur with an internally separable proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a modification to QMA where having one quantum proof is strictly less powerful than having two unentangled proofs, assuming EXP $\ne$ NEXP. This gives a new route to prove QMA(2) = NEXP that overcomes the primary drawback of a recent approach [arXiv:2402.18790 , arXiv:2306.13247] (QIP 2024). Our modification endows each proof with a form of *multipartite* unentanglement: after tracing out one register, a small number of qubits are separable from the rest of the state.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness in the (Inverseless) Haar Random Oracle Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the (in)feasibility of quantum pseudorandom notions in a quantum analog of the random oracle model, where all the parties, including the adversary, have oracle access to the same Haar random unitary. In this model, we show the following:
  - (Unbounded-query secure) pseudorandom unitaries (PRU) exist. Moreover, the PRU construction makes two calls to the Haar oracle.
  - We consider constructions of PRUs making a single call to the Haar oracle. In this setting, we show that unbounded-query security is impossible to achieve. We complement this result by showing that bounded-query secure PRUs do exist with a single query to the Haar oracle.
  - We show that multi-copy pseudorandom state generators and function-like state generators (with classical query access), making a single call to the Haar oracle, exist.
  Our results have two consequences: (a) when the Haar random unitary is instantiated suitably, our results present viable approaches for building quantum pseudorandom objects without relying upon one-way functions and, (b) for the first time, we show that the key length in pseudorandom unitaries can be generically shrunk (relative to the output length). Our results are also some of the first usecases of the new "path recording" formalism for Haar random unitaries, introduced in the recent breakthrough work of Ma and Huang.</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness-of-Approximation for Token Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the token swapping problem, in which we are given a graph with an initial assignment of one distinct token to each vertex, and a final desired assignment (again with one token per vertex). The goal is to find the minimum length sequence of swaps of adjacent tokens required to get from the initial to final assignment.
  The token swapping problem is known to be NP-complete. It is also known to have a polynomial-time 4-approximation algorithm. From the hardness-of-approximation side, it is known to be NP-hard to approximate with ratio better than 1001/1000.
  Our main result is an improvement of the approximation ratio of the lower bound: We show that it is NP-hard to approximate with ratio better than 14/13.
  We then turn our attention to the 0/1-weighted version, in which every token has a weight of either 0 or 1, and the cost of a swap is the sum of the weights of the two participating tokens. Unlike standard token swapping, no constant-factor approximation is known for this version, and we provide an explanation. We prove that 0/1-weighted token swapping is NP-hard to approximate with ratio better than $(1-\varepsilon) \ln(n)$ for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$.
  Lastly, we prove two barrier results for the standard (unweighted) token swapping problem. We show that one cannot beat the current best known approximation ratio of 4 using a large class of algorithms which includes all known algorithms, nor can one beat it using a common analysis framework.</description>
