      <title>Combining Genre Classification and Harmonic-Percussive Features with Diffusion Models for Music-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for generating music visualisers using diffusion models, combining audio input with user-selected artwork. The process involves two main stages: image generation and video creation. First, music captioning and genre classification are performed, followed by the retrieval of artistic style descriptions. A diffusion model then generates images based on the user's input image and the derived artistic style descriptions. The video generation stage utilises the same diffusion model to interpolate frames, controlled by audio energy vectors derived from key musical features of harmonics and percussives. The method demonstrates promising results across various genres, and a new metric, Audio-Visual Synchrony (AVS), is introduced to quantitatively evaluate the synchronisation between visual and audio elements. Comparative analysis shows significantly higher AVS values for videos generated using the proposed method with audio energy vectors, compared to linear interpolation. This approach has potential applications in diverse fields, including independent music video creation, film production, live music events, and enhancing audio-visual experiences in public spaces.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Controllable Video-to-Music Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.</description>

      <title>pyAMPACT: A Score-Audio Alignment Toolkit for Performance Data Estimation and Multi-modal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: pyAMPACT (Python-based Automatic Music Performance Analysis and Comparison Toolkit) links symbolic and audio music representations to facilitate score-informed estimation of performance data in audio as well as general linking of symbolic and audio music representations with a variety of annotations. pyAMPACT can read a range of symbolic formats and can output note-linked audio descriptors/performance data into MEI-formatted files. The audio analysis uses score alignment to calculate time-frequency regions of importance for each note in the symbolic representation from which to estimate a range of parameters. These include tuning-, dynamics-, and timbre-related performance descriptors, with timing-related information available from the score alignment. Beyond performance data estimation, pyAMPACT also facilitates multi-modal investigations through its infrastructure for linking symbolic representations and annotations to audio.</description>

      <title>Securing Social Media Against Deepfakes using Identity, Behavioral, and Geometric Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust in social media is a growing concern due to its ability to influence significant societal changes. However, this space is increasingly compromised by various types of deepfake multimedia, which undermine the authenticity of shared content. Although substantial efforts have been made to address the challenge of deepfake content, existing detection techniques face a major limitation in generalization: they tend to perform well only on specific types of deepfakes they were trained on.This dependency on recognizing specific deepfake artifacts makes current methods vulnerable when applied to unseen or varied deepfakes, thereby compromising their performance in real-world applications such as social media platforms. To address the generalizability of deepfake detection, there is a need for a holistic approach that can capture a broader range of facial attributes and manipulations beyond isolated artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel deepfake detection framework featuring an effective feature descriptor that integrates Deep identity, Behavioral, and Geometric (DBaG) signatures, along with a classifier named DBaGNet. Specifically, the DBaGNet classifier utilizes the extracted DBaG signatures, leveraging a triplet loss objective to enhance generalized representation learning for improved classification. Specifically, the DBaGNet classifier utilizes the extracted DBaG signatures and applies a triplet loss objective to enhance generalized representation learning for improved classification. To test the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments using six benchmark deepfake datasets: WLDR, CelebDF, DFDC, FaceForensics++, DFD, and NVFAIR. Specifically, to ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we perform cross-dataset evaluations, and the results demonstrate significant performance gains over several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>WavFusion: Towards wav2vec 2.0 Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging yet crucial task due to the inherent complexity and diversity of human emotions. To address this problem, researchers attempt to fuse information from other modalities via multimodal learning. However, existing multimodal fusion techniques often overlook the intricacies of cross-modal interactions, resulting in suboptimal feature representations. In this paper, we propose WavFusion, a multimodal speech emotion recognition framework that addresses critical research problems in effective multimodal fusion, heterogeneity among modalities, and discriminative representation learning. By leveraging a gated cross-modal attention mechanism and multimodal homogeneous feature discrepancy learning, WavFusion demonstrates improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our work highlights the importance of capturing nuanced cross-modal interactions and learning discriminative representations for accurate multimodal SER. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets (IEMOCAP and MELD) demonstrate that WavFusion succeeds over the state-of-the-art strategies on emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>SizeGS: Size-aware Compression of 3D Gaussians with Hierarchical Mixed Precision Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective compression technology is crucial for 3DGS to adapt to varying storage and transmission conditions. However, existing methods fail to address size constraints while maintaining optimal quality. In this paper, we introduce SizeGS, a framework that compresses 3DGS within a specified size budget while optimizing visual quality. We start with a size estimator to establish a clear relationship between file size and hyperparameters. Leveraging this estimator, we incorporate mixed precision quantization (MPQ) into 3DGS attributes, structuring MPQ in two hierarchical level -- inter-attribute and intra-attribute -- to optimize visual quality under the size constraint. At the inter-attribute level, we assign bit-widths to each attribute channel by formulating the combinatorial optimization as a 0-1 integer linear program, which can be efficiently solved. At the intra-attribute level, we divide each attribute channel into blocks of vectors, quantizing each vector based on the optimal bit-width derived at the inter-attribute level. Dynamic programming determines block lengths. Using the size estimator and MPQ, we develop a calibrated algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters in just 10 minutes, achieving a 1.69$\times$ efficiency increase with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SILMM: Self-Improving Large Multimodal Models for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, pushing forward advancements in text-to-image generation. However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment. Extensive experiments on three compositional text-to-image generation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of SILMM, showing improvements exceeding 30% on T2I-CompBench++ and around 20% on DPG-Bench.</description>

      <title>M6: Multi-generator, Multi-domain, Multi-lingual and cultural, Multi-genres, Multi-instrument Machine-Generated Music Detection Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-generated music (MGM) has emerged as a powerful tool with applications in music therapy, personalised editing, and creative inspiration for the music community. However, its unregulated use threatens the entertainment, education, and arts sectors by diminishing the value of high-quality human compositions. Detecting machine-generated music (MGMD) is, therefore, critical to safeguarding these domains, yet the field lacks comprehensive datasets to support meaningful progress. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{M6}, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for MGMD research. M6 is distinguished by its diversity, encompassing multiple generators, domains, languages, cultural contexts, genres, and instruments. We outline our methodology for data selection and collection, accompanied by detailed data analysis, providing all WAV form of music. Additionally, we provide baseline performance scores using foundational binary classification models, illustrating the complexity of MGMD and the significant room for improvement. By offering a robust and multifaceted resource, we aim to empower future research to develop more effective detection methods for MGM. We believe M6 will serve as a critical step toward addressing this societal challenge. The dataset and code will be freely available to support open collaboration and innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>Pilot-guided Multimodal Semantic Communication for Audio-Visual Event Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal semantic communication, which integrates various data modalities such as text, images, and audio, significantly enhances communication efficiency and reliability. It has broad application prospects in fields such as artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, and smart homes. However, current research primarily relies on analog channels and assumes constant channel states (perfect CSI), which is inadequate for addressing dynamic physical channels and noise in real-world scenarios. Existing methods often focus on single modality tasks and fail to handle multimodal stream data, such as video and audio, and their corresponding tasks. Furthermore, current semantic encoding and decoding modules mainly transmit single modality features, neglecting the need for multimodal semantic enhancement and recognition tasks.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a pilot-guided framework for multimodal semantic communication specifically tailored for audio-visual event localization tasks. This framework utilizes digital pilot codes and channel modules to guide the state of analog channels in real-wold scenarios and designs Euler-based multimodal semantic encoding and decoding that consider time-frequency characteristics based on dynamic channel state. This approach effectively handles multimodal stream source data, especially for audio-visual event localization tasks. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework in channel changes and its support for various communication scenarios. The experimental results show that the framework outperforms existing benchmark methods in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), highlighting its advantage in semantic communication quality.</description>

      <title>Sound2Vision: Generating Diverse Visuals from Audio through Cross-Modal Latent Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does audio describe the world around us? In this work, we propose a method for generating images of visual scenes from diverse in-the-wild sounds. This cross-modal generation task is challenging due to the significant information gap between auditory and visual signals. We address this challenge by designing a model that aligns audio-visual modalities by enriching audio features with visual information and translating them into the visual latent space. These features are then fed into the pre-trained image generator to produce images. To enhance image quality, we use sound source localization to select audio-visual pairs with strong cross-modal correlations. Our method achieves substantially better results on the VEGAS and VGGSound datasets compared to previous work and demonstrates control over the generation process through simple manipulations to the input waveform or latent space. Furthermore, we analyze the geometric properties of the learned embedding space and demonstrate that our learning approach effectively aligns audio-visual signals for cross-modal generation. Based on this analysis, we show that our method is agnostic to specific design choices, showing its generalizability by integrating various model architectures and different types of audio-visual data.</description>

      <title>MSCrackMamba: Leveraging Vision Mamba for Crack Detection in Fused Multispectral Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crack detection is a critical task in structural health monitoring, aimed at assessing the structural integrity of bridges, buildings, and roads to prevent potential failures. Vision-based crack detection has become the mainstream approach due to its ease of implementation and effectiveness. Fusing infrared (IR) channels with red, green and blue (RGB) channels can enhance feature representation and thus improve crack detection. However, IR and RGB channels often differ in resolution. To align them, higher-resolution RGB images typically need to be downsampled to match the IR image resolution, which leads to the loss of fine details. Moreover, crack detection performance is restricted by the limited receptive fields and high computational complexity of traditional image segmentation networks. Inspired by the recently proposed Mamba neural architecture, this study introduces a two-stage paradigm called MSCrackMamba, which leverages Vision Mamba along with a super-resolution network to address these challenges. Specifically, to align IR and RGB channels, we first apply super-resolution to IR channels to match the resolution of RGB channels for data fusion. Vision Mamba is then adopted as the backbone network, while UperNet is employed as the decoder for crack detection. Our approach is validated on the large-scale Crack Detection dataset Crack900, demonstrating an improvement of 3.55% in mIoU compared to the best-performing baseline methods.</description>

      <title>4D Gaussian Splatting with Scale-aware Residual Field and Adaptive Optimization for Real-time Rendering of Temporally Complex Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic scenes from video sequences is a highly promising task in the multimedia domain. While previous methods have made progress, they often struggle with slow rendering and managing temporal complexities such as significant motion and object appearance/disappearance. In this paper, we propose SaRO-GS as a novel dynamic scene representation capable of achieving real-time rendering while effectively handling temporal complexities in dynamic scenes. To address the issue of slow rendering speed, we adopt a Gaussian primitive-based representation and optimize the Gaussians in 4D space, which facilitates real-time rendering with the assistance of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Additionally, to handle temporally complex dynamic scenes, we introduce a Scale-aware Residual Field. This field considers the size information of each Gaussian primitive while encoding its residual feature and aligns with the self-splitting behavior of Gaussian primitives. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Optimization Schedule, which assigns different optimization strategies to Gaussian primitives based on their distinct temporal properties, thereby expediting the reconstruction of dynamic regions. Through evaluations on monocular and multi-view datasets, our method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. Please see our project page at https://yjb6.github.io/SaRO-GS.github.io.</description>

      <title>Agent Journey Beyond RGB: Unveiling Hybrid Semantic-Spatial Environmental Representations for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating unseen environments based on natural language instructions remains difficult for egocentric agents in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). While recent advancements have yielded promising outcomes, they primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, often overlooking the underlying semantic knowledge and spatial cues. Intuitively, humans inherently ground textual semantics within the spatial layout during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to facilitate navigation. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in the agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-based Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that SUSA hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON). The source code will be publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, is a prominent research area that aims to generate natural-sounding human speech from text. Recently, with the increasing industrial demand, TTS technologies have evolved beyond synthesizing human-like speech to enabling controllable speech generation. This includes fine-grained control over various attributes of synthesized speech such as emotion, prosody, timbre, and duration. Besides, advancements in deep learning, such as diffusion and large language models, have significantly enhanced controllable TTS over the past several years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of controllable TTS, covering approaches ranging from basic control techniques to methods utilizing natural language prompts, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the current state of research. We examine the general controllable TTS pipeline, challenges, model architectures, and control strategies, offering a comprehensive and clear taxonomy of existing methods. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of datasets and evaluation metrics and shed some light on the applications and future directions of controllable TTS. To the best of our knowledge, this survey paper provides the first comprehensive review of emerging controllable TTS methods, which can serve as a beneficial resource for both academic researchers and industry practitioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of "bedroom producers" has democratized music creation, while challenging producers to objectively evaluate their work. To address this, we present AI TrackMate, an LLM-based music chatbot designed to provide constructive feedback on music productions. By combining LLMs' inherent musical knowledge with direct audio track analysis, AI TrackMate offers production-specific insights, distinguishing it from text-only approaches. Our framework integrates a Music Analysis Module, an LLM-Readable Music Report, and Music Production-Oriented Feedback Instruction, creating a plug-and-play, training-free system compatible with various LLMs and adaptable to future advancements. We demonstrate AI TrackMate's capabilities through an interactive web interface and present findings from a pilot study with a music producer. By bridging AI capabilities with the needs of independent producers, AI TrackMate offers on-demand analytical feedback, potentially supporting the creative process and skill development in music production. This system addresses the growing demand for objective self-assessment tools in the evolving landscape of independent music production.</description>

      <title>MuMu-LLaMA: Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on large language models has advanced significantly across text, speech, images, and videos. However, multi-modal music understanding and generation remain underexplored due to the lack of well-annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce a dataset with 167.69 hours of multi-modal data, including text, images, videos, and music annotations. Based on this dataset, we propose MuMu-LLaMA, a model that leverages pre-trained encoders for music, images, and videos. For music generation, we integrate AudioLDM 2 and MusicGen. Our evaluation across four tasks--music understanding, text-to-music generation, prompt-based music editing, and multi-modal music generation--demonstrates that MuMu-LLaMA outperforms state-of-the-art models, showing its potential for multi-modal music applications.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Aligned Contrastive Learning Between Images and Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional music search engines rely on retrieval methods that match natural language queries with music metadata. There have been increasing efforts to expand retrieval methods to consider the audio characteristics of music itself, using queries of various modalities including text, video, and speech. While most approaches aim to match general music semantics to the input queries, only a few focus on affective qualities. In this work, we address the task of retrieving emotionally-relevant music from image queries by learning an affective alignment between images and music audio. Our approach focuses on learning an emotion-aligned joint embedding space between images and music. This embedding space is learned via emotion-supervised contrastive learning, using an adapted cross-modal version of the SupCon loss. We evaluate the joint embeddings through cross-modal retrieval tasks (image-to-music and music-to-image) based on emotion labels. Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of the learned music embeddings via automatic music tagging. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully aligns images and music, and that the learned embedding space is effective for cross-modal retrieval applications.</description>

      <title>M$^{2}$UGen: Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation with the Power of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11255v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current landscape of research leveraging large language models (LLMs) is experiencing a surge. Many works harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of these models to comprehend various modalities, such as text, speech, images, videos, etc. They also utilize LLMs to understand human intention and generate desired outputs like images, videos, and music. However, research that combines both understanding and generation using LLMs is still limited and in its nascent stage. To address this gap, we introduce a Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation (M$^{2}$UGen) framework that integrates LLM's abilities to comprehend and generate music for different modalities. The M$^{2}$UGen framework is purpose-built to unlock creative potential from diverse sources of inspiration, encompassing music, image, and video through the use of pretrained MERT, ViT, and ViViT models, respectively. To enable music generation, we explore the use of AudioLDM 2 and MusicGen. Bridging multi-modal understanding and music generation is accomplished through the integration of the LLaMA 2 model. Furthermore, we make use of the MU-LLaMA model to generate extensive datasets that support text/image/video-to-music generation, facilitating the training of our M$^{2}$UGen framework. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves or surpasses the performance of the current state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Towards Emotion Analysis in Short-form Videos: A Large-Scale Dataset and Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, short-form videos (SVs) are essential to web information acquisition and sharing in our daily life. The prevailing use of SVs to spread emotions leads to the necessity of conducting video emotion analysis (VEA) towards SVs. Considering the lack of SVs emotion data, we introduce a large-scale dataset named eMotions, comprising 27,996 videos. Meanwhile, we alleviate the impact of subjectivities on labeling quality by emphasizing better personnel allocations and multi-stage annotations. In addition, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented variants through targeted data sampling. Some commonly used videos, such as facial expressions, have been well studied. However, it is still challenging to analysis the emotions in SVs. Since the broader content diversity brings more distinct semantic gaps and difficulties in learning emotion-related features, and there exists local biases and collective information gaps caused by the emotion inconsistence under the prevalently audio-visual co-expressions. To tackle these challenges, we present an end-to-end audio-visual baseline AV-CANet which employs the video transformer to better learn semantically relevant representations. We further design the Local-Global Fusion Module to progressively capture the correlations of audio-visual features. The EP-CE Loss is then introduced to guide model optimization. Extensive experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for future works. Besides, we investigate the key components of AV-CANet by ablation studies. Datasets and code will be fully open soon.</description>

      <title>StableMoFusion: Towards Robust and Efficient Diffusion-based Motion Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the powerful generative capacity of diffusion models, recent years have witnessed rapid progress in human motion generation. Existing diffusion-based methods employ disparate network architectures and training strategies. The effect of the design of each component is still unclear. In addition, the iterative denoising process consumes considerable computational overhead, which is prohibitive for real-time scenarios such as virtual characters and humanoid robots. For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference processs. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://h-y1heng.github.io/StableMoFusion-page/</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Virtual Teacher for Enhanced Educational Efficiency: Leveraging Large Pretrain Models for Autonomous Error Analysis and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Students frequently make mistakes while solving mathematical problems, and traditional error correction methods are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper introduces an innovative \textbf{V}irtual \textbf{A}I \textbf{T}eacher system designed to autonomously analyze and correct student \textbf{E}rrors (VATE). Leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs), the system uses student drafts as a primary source for error analysis, which enhances understanding of the student's learning process. It incorporates sophisticated prompt engineering and maintains an error pool to reduce computational overhead. The AI-driven system also features a real-time dialogue component for efficient student interaction. Our approach demonstrates significant advantages over traditional and machine learning-based error correction methods, including reduced educational costs, high scalability, and superior generalizability. The system has been deployed on the Squirrel AI learning platform for elementary mathematics education, where it achieves 78.3\% accuracy in error analysis and shows a marked improvement in student learning efficiency. Satisfaction surveys indicate a strong positive reception, highlighting the system's potential to transform educational practices.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion Balancing Through Game-Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by uncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail to fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been attributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training resources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods struggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as ensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in multimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new modalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) Introducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each modality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final outcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond the ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to significant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.</description>
