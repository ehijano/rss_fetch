      <description>arXiv:2406.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Tate conjecture for divisors over a finite field $\mathbb F$ is equivalent to an explicit algebraic problem about the third Milnor K-group of the function field $\bar {\mathbb F}(x,y,z)$ in three variables over $\bar {\mathbb F}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of quantized barycenters of lattice polytopes with applications to algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses a combinatorial problem with applications to algebraic geometry. To a convex lattice polytope $P$ and each of its integer dilations $kP$ one may associate the barycenter of its lattice points. This sequence of $k$-quantized barycenters converge to the (classical) barycenter of the polytope considered as a convex body. A basic question arises: is there a complete asymptotic expansion for this sequence? If so, what are its terms? This article initiates the study of this question. First, we establish the existence of such an expansion as well as determine the first two terms. Second, for Delzant lattice polytopes we use toric algebra to determine all terms using mixed volumes of virtual rooftop polytopes, or alternatively in terms of higher Donaldson--Futaki invariants. Third, for reflexive polytopes we show the quantized barycenters are colinear to first order, and actually colinear in the case of polygons. The proofs use Ehrhart theory, convexity arguments, and toric algebra. As applications we derive the complete asymptotic expansion of the Fujita--Odaka stability thresholds $\delta_k$ on arbitrary polarizations on (possibly singular) toric varieties. In fact, we show they are rational functions of $k$ for sufficiently large $k$. This gives the first general result on Tian's stabilization problem for $\delta_k$-invariants for (possibly singular) toric Fanos: $\delta_k$ stabilize in $k$ if and only if they are all equal to $1$, and when smooth if and only if asymptotically Chow semistable. We also relate the asymptotic expansions to higher Donaldson--Futaki invariants of test configurations motivated by Ehrhart theory, and unify in passing previous results of Donaldson, Ono, Futaki, and Rubinstein--Tian--Zhang.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of generic hypersurfaces of polynomial degree via Green-Griffiths jet differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new version of a recent result of B{\'e}rczi-Kirwan, proving the Kobayashi and Green-Griffiths-Lang conjectures for generic hypersurfaces in the projective space , with a polynomial lower bound on the degree. Our strategy again relies on Siu's technique of slanted vector fields and the use of holomorphic Morse inequalities to prove the existence of a jet differential equation with a negative twist -- however, instead of using a space of invariant jet differentials, we base our computations on the classical Green-Griffiths jet spaces.</description>

      <title>Shifted symplectic pushforwards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce how to pushforward shifted symplectic fibrations along base changes. This is achieved by considering symplectic forms that are closed in a stronger sense. Examples include: symplectic zero loci and symplectic quotients. Observing that twisted cotangent bundles are symplectic pushforwards, we obtain an equivalence between symplectic fibrations and Lagrangians to critical loci.
  We provide two local structure theorems for symplectic fibrations: a smooth local structure theorem for higher stacks via symplectic zero loci and twisted cotangents, and an {\'e}tale local structure theorem for $1$-stacks with reductive stabilizers via symplectic quotients of the smooth local models.
  We resolve deformation invariance issue in Donaldson-Thomas theory of Calabi-Yau $4$-folds. Abstractly, we associate virtual Lagrangian cycles for oriented $(-2)$-symplectic fibrations as unique functorial bivariant classes over the exact loci. For moduli of perfect complexes, we show that the exact loci consist of deformations for which the $(0,4)$-Hodge pieces of the second Chern characters remain zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide new examples of 1-obstructed and atomic sheaves on an infinite series of locally complete families of projective hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. More precisely,
  (1) we prove that the fixed loci of the natural anti-symplectic involutions on the moduli spaces of stable objects in the Kuznetsov component $\mathcal{K}u(X)$ of a Gushel-Mukai fourfold $X$ are 1-obstructed Lagrangian submanifolds, and
  (2) we construct a family of immersed atomic Lagrangian submanifolds on each moduli space of stable objects in $\mathcal{K}u(X)$.
  Additionally, we discuss examples of atomic Lagrangian submanifolds satisfying $b_1=20$ in a family of hyper-K\"ahler manifolds of $\mathrm{K3^{[2]}}$-type, as well as atomic sheaves supported on non-atomic Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>On the torsion locus of the Ceresa normal function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the positive-dimensional part of the torsion locus of the Ceresa normal function in $\mathcal{M}_g$ is not Zariski dense when $g\geq 3$. Moreover, it has only finitely many components with generic Mumford-Tate group equal to $\mathrm{GSp}_{2g}$; these components are defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, and their union is closed under the action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb Q)$. More generally, we study the distribution of the torsion locus of arbitrary admissible normal functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a survey on formality results relying on weight structures. A weight structure is a naturally occurring grading on certain differential graded algebras. If this weight satisfies a purity property, one can deduce formality. Algebraic geometry provides us with such weight structures as the cohomology of algebraic varieties tends to present additional structures including a Hodge structure or a Galois action.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic solutions to KZ equations, ordinary crystals, and $p^s$-hypergeometric solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the KZ connection associated with a family of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Then the dual connection is the Gauss-Manin connection of that family. We observe that the Gauss-Manin connection has an ordinary $F$-crystal structure and its unit root subcrystal is of rank $g$. We prove that all local flat sections of the KZ connection annihilate the unite root subcrystal, and the space of all local flat sections of the KZ connection is a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module of rank $g$. We also consider the reduction modulo $p^s$ of the unit root subcrystal for any $s\geq 1$. We prove that its annihilator is generated by the so-called $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections of the KZ connection. In particular, that means that the reduction modulo $p^s$ of an arbitrary local flat section of the KZ connection over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a linear combination of the $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections.</description>

Abstract: We define certain closed subvarieties of the flag variety, Hessenberg ideal fibers, and prove that they are paved by affines. Hessenberg ideal fibers are a natural generalization of Springer fibers. In type $G_2$, we give explicit descriptions of all Hessenberg ideal fibers, study some of their geometric properties and use them to completely classify Tymoczko's dot actions of the Weyl group on the cohomology of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties.</description>

Abstract: We study the summands of the decomposition theorem for the Hitchin system for $\mathrm{GL}_n$, in arbitrary degree, over the locus of reduced spectral curves. A key ingredient is a new correspondence between these summands and the topology of hypertoric quiver varieties. In contrast to the case of meromorphic Higgs fields, the intersection cohomology groups of moduli spaces of regular Higgs bundles depend on the degree. We describe this dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We attach two binary codes to a projective nodal surface (the strict code K and, for even degree d, the extended code K' ) to investigate the `Nodal Severi varieties F(d, n) of nodal surfaces in P^3 of degree d and with n nodes, and their incidence hierarchy, relating partial smoothings to code shortenings. Our first main result solves a question which dates back over 100 years: the irreducible components of F(4, n) are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of their extended codes K', and these are exactly all the 34 possible shortenings of the extended Kummer code K' , and a component is in the closure of another if and only if the code of the latter is a shortening of the code of the former. We extend this result classifying the irreducible components of all nodal K3 surfaces in the same way, and we fully classify their extended codes. In this classification there are some sporadic cases, obtain through projection from a node.
  For surfaces of degree d=5 in P^3 we determine (with one possible exception) all the possible codes K, and for several cases of K, we show the irreducibility of the corresponding open set of F(5, n), for instance we show the irreducibility of the family of Togliatti quintic surfaces. In the fourth part we show that a `Togliatti-like' description holds for surfaces of degree 6 with the maximum number of nodes= 65: they are discriminants of cubic hypersurfaces in P^6 with 31 (respectively 32) nodes, and we have an irreducible 18-dimensional family of them. For degree d=6, our main result is based on some novel auxiliary results: 1) the study of the half-even sets of nodes on sextic surfaces, 2) the investigation of discriminants of cubic hypersurfaces X, 3) the computer assisted proof that, for n = 65, both codes K, K' are uniquely determined, 4) the description of these codes, relating the geometry of the Barth sextic with the Doro-Hall graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\gamma \geq 7$ and $g \geq 6\gamma + 5$, we construct a family $\mathcal{F}^{\prime}$ of curves lying on cones in $\mathbb{P}^{g-3\gamma+1}$ over smooth non-degenerate curves of genus $\gamma$ and degree $g-2\gamma$ in $\mathbb{P}^{g-3\gamma+1}$. We show that $\dim \mathcal{F}^{\prime} = 2g-\gamma-1 + (g-3\gamma+1)^2$. For a general curve $X^{\prime}$ from the family $\mathcal{F}^{\prime}$, we compute the dimension of the space of its first-order deformations. We prove that the family $\mathcal{F}^{\prime}$ gives rise to an irreducible, non-reduced component $\mathcal{D}^{\prime}$ of the Hilbert scheme $\mathcal{I}_{2g-4\gamma + 1, g, g - 3\gamma + 1}$, which parametrizes smooth, irreducible, non-degenerate curves of degree $2g-4\gamma + 1$ and genus $g$ in $\mathbb{P}^{g-3\gamma+1}$. We obtain $\dim T_{[X^{\prime}]} \mathcal{D}^{\prime} = \dim \mathcal{D}^{\prime} + 1 = \dim \mathcal{F}^{\prime} + 1$.</description>

      <title>Chain-order polytopes: toric degenerations, Young tableaux and monomial bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03499v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our first result realizes the toric variety of every marked chain-order polytope (MCOP) of the Gelfand--Tsetlin poset as an explicit Gr\"obner (sagbi) degeneration of the flag variety. This generalizes the Sturmfels/Gonciulea--Lakshmibai/Kogan--Miller construction for the Gelfand--Tsetlin degeneration to the MCOP setting. The key idea of our approach is to use pipe dreams to define realizations of toric varieties in Pl\"ucker coordinates. We then use this approach to generalize two more well-known constructions to arbitrary MCOPs: standard monomial theories such as those given by semistandard Young tableaux and PBW-monomial bases in irreducible representations such as the FFLV bases. In an addendum we introduce the notion of semi-infinite pipe dreams and use it to obtain an infinite family of poset polytopes each providing a toric degeneration of the semi-infinite Grassmannian.</description>

Abstract: We study Fourier transforms of holonomic D-modules on the affine line and show that their enhanced solution complexes are described by a twisted Morse theory. We thus recover and even strengthen the well-known formula for their exponential factors i.e. the stationary phase method. In the course of our study, we also obtain a formula for the characteristic cycles of the Fourier transforms and construct natural bases of their holomorphic solutions via rapid decay homology cycles.</description>

      <title>Tautological projection for cycles on the moduli space of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a tautological projection operator for algebraic cycle classes on the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties $\mathcal{A}_g$: every cycle class decomposes canonically as a sum of a tautological and a non-tautological part. The main new result required for the definition of the projection operator is the vanishing of the top Chern class of the Hodge bundle over the boundary $\bar{\mathcal{A}}_g\smallsetminus \mathcal{A}_g$ of any toroidal compactification $\bar{\mathcal{A}}_g$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$. We prove the vanishing by a careful study of residues in the boundary geometry.
  The existence of the projection operator raises many natural questions about cycles on $\mathcal{A}_g$. We calculate the projections of all product cycles $\mathcal{A}_{g_1}\times \ldots \times \mathcal{A}_{g_\ell}$ in terms of Schur determinants, discuss Faber's earlier calculations related to the Torelli locus, and state several open questions. The Appendix contains a conjecture about the projection of the locus of abelian varieties with real multiplication.</description>

      <title>A specialisation theorem for Lang-N\'eron groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, for a polarised smooth projective variety $B \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_k$ of dimension $\geq 2$ over an infinite field $k$ and an abelian variety $A$ over the function field of $B$, there exists a dense Zariski open set of smooth geometrically connected hyperplane sections $h$ of $B$ such that $A$ has good reduction at $h$ and the specialisation homomorphism of Lang-N\'eron groups at $h$ is injective (up to a finite $p$-group in positive characteristic $p$). This gives a positive answer to a conjecture of the first author, which is used to deduce a negative definiteness result on his refined height pairing. This also sheds a new light on N\'eron's specialisation theorem.</description>

      <title>Graded Lie Algebras, Compactified Jacobians and Arithmetic Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simply laced Dynkin diagram gives rise to a family of curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and a coregular representation, using deformations of simple singularities and Vinberg theory respectively. Thorne has conjectured and partially proven a strong link between the arithmetic of these curves and the rational orbits of these representations. In this paper, we complete Thorne's picture and show that $2$-Selmer elements of the Jacobians of the smooth curves in each family can be parametrised by integral orbits of the corresponding representation. Using geometry-of-numbers techniques, we deduce statistical results on the arithmetic of these curves. We prove these results in a uniform manner. This recovers and generalises results of Bhargava, Gross, Ho, Shankar, Shankar and Wang. The main innovations are: an analysis of torsors on affine spaces using results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and the Grothendieck--Serre conjecture, a study of geometric properties of compactified Jacobians using the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition, and a general construction of integral orbit representatives.</description>

      <title>The $a$-number of $y^n=x^m+x$ over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formula for $a$-number of certain maximal curves characterized by the equation $y^{\frac{q+1}{2}} = x^m + x$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. $a$-number serves as an invariant for the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion group scheme. Utilizing the action of the Cartier operator on $H^0(\mathcal{X}, \Omega^1)$, we establish a closed formula for $a$-number of $\mathcal{X}$.</description>
