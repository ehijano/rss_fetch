      <title>LUND-PROBE -- LUND Prostate Radiotherapy Open Benchmarking and Evaluation dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer relies on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for segmentation of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs). Manual segmentation of these volumes is regarded as the gold standard for ground truth in machine learning applications but to acquire such data is tedious and time-consuming. A publicly available clinical dataset is presented, comprising MRI- and synthetic CT (sCT) images, target and OARs segmentations, and radiotherapy dose distributions for 432 prostate cancer patients treated with MRI-guided radiotherapy. An extended dataset with 35 patients is also included, with the addition of deep learning (DL)-generated segmentations, DL segmentation uncertainty maps, and DL segmentations manually adjusted by four radiation oncologists. The publication of these resources aims to aid research within the fields of automated radiotherapy treatment planning, segmentation, inter-observer analyses, and DL model uncertainty investigation. The dataset is hosted on the AIDA Data Hub and offers a free-to-use resource for the scientific community, valuable for the advancement of medical imaging and prostate cancer radiotherapy research.</description>

      <title>Calibration of a $\Delta$E-E telescope based on CeBr$_3$ scintillator for secondary charged particles measurements in hadron therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadrontherapy is a promising cancer treatment method that offers better dose conformity and reduces damage to healthy tissues compared to conventional radiotherapy. However, one major challenge remaining is the precise characterization of secondary particles generated by nuclear interactions of the primary beam with tissues. Current data on secondary charged particles, such as protons and light ions, remain insufficient, particularly in the clinically relevant energy ranges. This lack of experimental data introduces uncertainties in treatment planning softwares and Monte Carlo calculations, thus compromising the accuracy of dose delivery to the patients. This work consists in the characterization of secondary charged particles generated in hadron therapy using a $\Delta$E-E telescope comprising a CeBr$_3$ crystal scintillator and a plastic scintillator. The calibration and response of this telescope to ions commonly used in clinical settings is presented in this work, highlighting adherence to Birks law for accurate energy measurements. This study is the first to optimize a $\Delta$E-E telescope combining CeBr$_3$ and plastic scintillators specifically for secondary particle detection in hadrontherapy. This represents an important step in the exploitation of the system for nuclear data acquisition, as it enables both the measurement of energy and the discrimination of secondary particles. The objective is to develop a system compatible with clinical use, allowing for the most precise possible comparison with treatment planning software calculations.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Scatter Correction on a Long-axial Field-of-view PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) positron emission tomography (PET) systems allow higher sensitivity, with an increased number of detected lines of response induced by a larger angle of acceptance. However, this extended angle increases the number of multiple scatters and the scatter contribution within oblique planes. As scattering affects both quality and quantification of the reconstructed image, it is crucial to correct this effect with more accurate methods than the state-of-the-art single scatter simulation (SSS) that can reach its limits with such an extended field-of-view (FOV). In this work, which is an extension of our previous assessment of deep learning-based scatter estimation (DLSE) carried out on a conventional PET system, we aim to evaluate the DLSE method performance on LAFOV total-body PET.
  Approach: The proposed DLSE method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) U-Net architecture uses emission and attenuation sinograms to estimate scatter sinogram. The network was trained from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of XCAT phantoms [18F]-FDG PET acquisitions using a Siemens Biograph Vision Quadra scanner model, with multiple morphologies and dose distributions. We firstly evaluated the method performance on simulated data in both sinogram and image domain by comparing it to the MC ground truth and SSS scatter sinograms. We then tested the method on seven [18F]-FDG and seven [18F]-PSMA clinical datasets, and compare it to SSS estimations.
  Results: DLSE showed superior accuracy on phantom data, greater robustness to patient size and dose variations compared to SSS, and better lesion contrast recovery. It also yielded promising clinical results, improving lesion contrasts in [18F]-FDG datasets and performing consistently with [18F]-PSMA datasets despite no training with [18F]-PSMA.</description>

      <title>Enhancing kidney quality assessment: Power Doppler during normothermic machine perfusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: Marginal donor kidneys are increasingly used for transplantation to overcome organ shortage. This study aims to investigate the additional value of Power Doppler (PD) imaging in kidney quality assessment during normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Methods: Porcine kidneys (n=22) retrieved from a local slaughterhouse underwent 2 hours of NMP. Based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) and oxygen consumption (VO2), the kidneys were classified as functional (n=7) and non-functional (n=15) kidneys. PD imaging was performed at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, and PD metrics, including vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated. Renal blood flow (RBF), CrCl, and VO2 were measured at the same time points during NMP. The metrics were compared utilizing correlation analysis. Results: FI and VFI moderately correlated with CrCl (r=0.537, p&lt;0.0001; r=0.536, p&lt;0.0001, respectively), while VI strongly correlated with VO2 (r=0.839, p&lt;0.0001). At 120 minutes, PD metrics demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing functional from non-functional kidneys, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.943 for VI, 0.924 for FI, and 0.943 for VFI. Cutoff values of 17% for VI, 50 a.u. for FI, and 9 a.u. for VFI provided 100% specificity and 73% sensitivity to identify non-functional kidneys, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 82%. Baseline kidney biopsies showed moderate acute tubular necrosis in both groups with no significant differences. Conclusions: PD metrics strongly correlate with renal viability and effectively differentiate functional from non-functional kidneys. PD imaging can be a valuable alternative to RBF during NMP for kidney assessment.</description>
