      <title>Scaling laws of shrinkage induced fragmentation phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of the two-dimensional Ising model. Our findings provide a novel insights into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel pattern reconstruction through $L$-directional associative memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $L$-directional associative memories, composed of $L$ Hopfield networks, displaying imitative Hebbian intra-network interactions and anti-imitative Hebbian inter-network interactions, where couplings are built over a set of hidden binary patterns. We evaluate the model's performance in reconstructing the whole set of hidden binary patterns when provided with mixtures of noisy versions of these patterns. Our numerical results demonstrate the model's high effectiveness in the reconstruction task for structureless and structured datasets.</description>

      <title>Research the influence of road surface conditions on vibration and safety of Semi Trailer vehicle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Depending on the road surface profile, moving speed, transport weight, etc., the vehicle's body acceleration and dynamic load coefficient change as it moves. This study's goal is to ascertain the result of the road surface's influence on the vehicle, calculate the average vehicle body displacement acceleration and dynamic load coefficient, and validate your findings through testing. To confirm the simulation model's accuracy, experimental and theoretical simulation results are compared.. Methods: The Neuton-Euler approach and the multi-body system structure separation method are used in the paper to create dynamic equations using theoretical research methods [1]. Simulations are carried out using Matlab Simulink software to examine and assess the dynamics. Results: According to ISO 8608:2016 standard [2], theoretical research results have determined the average acceleration of the vehicle body, dynamic load coefficient, horizontal sway angle, and longitudinal sway angle when the vehicle moves on profiles C, D , E, F. Experiments show that there is an error of 7.4% and 8.1% when measuring the average acceleration and dynamic load coefficient k{\dj}max when the vehicle moves at a speed of 50 km/h on the road surface C compared to theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling study of three-dimensional XY spin glass toward the spin-chirality decoupling picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>

      <title>Landscape computations for the edge of chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic sampling approach to identify stability boundaries in general dynamical systems. The global landscape of Lyapunov exponent in multi-dimensional parameter space provides transition boundaries for stable/unstable trajectories, i.e., the edge of chaos. Despite its usefulness, it is generally difficult to derive analytically. In this study, we reveal the transition boundaries by leveraging the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm coupled directly with the numerical integration of nonlinear differential/difference equation. It is demonstrated that a posteriori modeling for parameter subspace along the edge of chaos determines an inherent constrained dynamical system to flexibly activate or de-activate the chaotic tra jectories.</description>

      <title>Interaction-free ergodicity breaking in spherical model driven by temporally hyperuniform noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temporal hyperuniformity of driving forces in the spherical model. The spherical model with $p$-body random interactions is a prototypical model to investigate the ergodicity breaking of glass transitions, where the spin-spin interactions are key ingredients to cause the ergodicity breaking. However, for the model driven by temporally hyperuniform noise, the strong anticorrelation of the noise can solely cause an ergodicity breaking even without spin-spin interactions. Near the transition point, the static susceptibility and relaxation time show power-law divergence with a common critical exponent, which varies depending on the strength of hyperuniformity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real quantum systems can exhibit a local object called local partial density of states (LPDOS) that cannot be proved within the axiomatic approach of quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that real mesoscopic system that can exhibit Fano resonances will show this object and also very counterintuitively it can become negative, resulting in the enhancement of coherent currents.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic inter-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <title>Volume dependence of microwave induced excess quasiparticles in superconducting resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of quasiparticles typically degrades the performance of superconducting microwave circuits. The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic, characterizes the beyond-Clifford operations needed to prepare a quantum state and constitutes an essential resource, alongside entanglement, for achieving quantum advantage. This work investigates how nonstabilizerness spreads under the dynamics of disordered quantum many-body systems. Using the $\ell$-bit model, a phenomenological model of many-body localization (MBL), we present an analytical description of the nonstabilizerness growth in MBL systems. We demonstrate that our analytical formulas describe the nonstabilizerness growth in strongly disordered quantum spin chains. Our findings establish a new facet of MBL phenomenology and identify the vital role of the disorder in slowing down the growth of the complexity of quantum states, important for our understanding of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material's morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalises puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a new class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of a universal phase diagram of quantum chains with range-$k$ interactions subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment. These systems exhibit "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert-space-fragmented phases as the charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that for any $d$, any state for $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages", which we define as subregions of the chain across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. Some blockages arise from sequences of frozen sites, i.e. sites with an unchanging on-site charge, while others do not involve frozen sites at all. We prove that the presence of blockages implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov subspaces that each form an exponentially vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical eigenstates at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement entropy, with rare "inverse quantum many-body scar" eigenstates featuring non-area-law scaling. We also numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We analytically derive some critical exponents characterizing the transition, and numerically determine the density of blockages at $\nu=\nu_c$, with clear implications for transport at the critical point. Finally, we investigate the properties of certain special-case models for which no phase transitions occur.</description>

      <title>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experimental implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces of definite charges are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization cannot be used to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework for the robustness of DTCs from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is rigorously proved if the system satisfies a certain condition where the mixing length, defined by the Hamming distance of the symmetry charges, does not exceed a global threshold. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing DTCs realized by kicking disordered systems, where conventional MBL-DTCs can be regarded as a special case of the subspace-thermal DTC with the subspace dimension being one, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to systems with higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as to higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. We show that they are distinct from quasicrystals, which we argue are akin to Fourier ''duals'' of gyromorphs. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. Finally, we introduce ''polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of novel materials with tailored electronic properties is crucial for modern device technologies, but time-consuming empirical methods hamper progress. We present an inverse design framework combining an enhanced Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with a specialized Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to accelerate the discovery of stable vanadium oxide (V-O) compositions. Our approach features (1) a WGAN with integrated stability constraints and formation energy predictions, enabling direct generation of thermodynamically feasible structures, and (2) a refined VAE capturing atomic positions and lattice parameters while maintaining chemical validity. Applying this framework, we generated 451 unique V-O compositions, with 91 stable and 44 metastable under rigorous thermodynamic criteria. Notably, we uncovered several novel V2O3 configurations with formation energies below the Materials Project convex hull, revealing previously unknown stable phases. Detailed spin-polarized DFT+U calculations showed distinct electronic behaviors, including promising half-metallic characteristics. Our approach outperforms existing methods in both quality and stability, demonstrating about a 20 percent stability rate under strict criteria compared to earlier benchmarks. Additionally, phonon calculations performed on selected compositions confirm dynamic stability: minor imaginary modes at 0 K likely stem from finite-size effects or known phase transitions, suggesting that these materials remain stable or metastable in practical conditions. These findings establish our framework as a powerful tool for accelerated materials discovery and highlight promising V-O candidates for next-generation electronic devices.</description>
