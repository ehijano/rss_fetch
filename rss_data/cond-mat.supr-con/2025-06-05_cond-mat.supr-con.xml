      <title>Phonon-Mediated Intrinsic Topological Superconductivity in Fermi Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that phonons can mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we demonstrate that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a wide range of chemical potentials. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave superconductivity in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we show a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the arc, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Multiband superconductivity in the topological Kramers nodal-line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent band-structure calculations predict that the ruthenium-based ternary silicides are three-dimensional Kramers nodal line semimetals. Among them, NbRuSi and TaRuSi show bulk superconductivity (SC) below $T_c \sim 3$ K and 4 K, as well as spontaneous magnetic fields. The latter indicates the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and, thus, unconventional SC in both compounds. Previous temperature-dependent muon-spin spectroscopy studies failed to distinguish whether such compounds exhibit single-gap or multi-gap SC. Here, we report on systematic measurements of the field-dependent muon-spin relaxation rates in the superconducting state and on temperature-dependent electrical resistivity and specific heat under applied magnetic fields. Both the upper critical field and the field-dependent superconducting relaxation are well described by a two-band model. By combining our experimental results with numerical band-structure calculations, we provide solid evidence for multiband SC in NbRuSi and TaRuSi, and thus offer further insight into the unconventional- and topological nature of their superconductivity.</description>

      <title>HTSC-2025: A Benchmark Dataset of Ambient-Pressure High-Temperature Superconductors for AI-Driven Critical Temperature Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconducting materials holds great significance for human industry and daily life. In recent years, research on predicting superconducting transition temperatures using artificial intelligence~(AI) has gained popularity, with most of these tools claiming to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the lack of widely accepted benchmark datasets in this field has severely hindered fair comparisons between different AI algorithms and impeded further advancement of these methods. In this work, we present the HTSC-2025, an ambient-pressure high-temperature superconducting benchmark dataset. This comprehensive compilation encompasses theoretically predicted superconducting materials discovered by theoretical physicists from 2023 to 2025 based on BCS superconductivity theory, including the renowned X$_2$YH$_6$ system, perovskite MXH$_3$ system, M$_3$XH$_8$ system, cage-like BCN-doped metal atomic systems derived from LaH$_{10}$ structural evolution, and two-dimensional honeycomb-structured systems evolving from MgB$_2$. The HTSC-2025 benchmark has been open-sourced at https://github.com/xqh19970407/HTSC-2025 and will be continuously updated. This benchmark holds significant importance for accelerating the discovery of superconducting materials using AI-based methods.</description>

      <title>Nernst effect and its thickness dependence in superconducting NbN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03975v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.</description>

      <title>Spin-glass state in nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optical measurements in La${}_{0.8}$Sr${}_{0.2}$NiO${}_2$ and Nd${}_{0.825}$Sr${}_{0.175}$NiO${}_2$ reveal an intriguing new facet of infinite-layer nickelate superconductors: the onset of spin-glass behavior at a temperature far exceeding the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$. This discovery sharply contrasts with copper oxide superconductors, where magnetism and superconductivity remain largely exclusive. Moreover, the magnitude and onset temperature of the polar Kerr effect in Nd${}_{0.825}$Sr${}_{0.175}$NiO${}_2$ fabricated on SrTiO${}_3$ and (LaAlO${}_3$)${}_{0.3}$(Sr${}_2$TaAlO${}_6$)${}_{0.7}$ substrates differ dramatically, while $T_c$ does not.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and modulable induced superconducting gap and effective Land\'e g-factor in Pb-InSb hybrid devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid system of a conventional superconductor (SC) on a semiconductor (SM) nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) represents a promising platform for achieving topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) towards topological quantum computation. While aluminum (Al)-based hybrid nanowire devices have been widely utilized, their limited superconducting gap and intrinsic weak SOC as well as small Land\'e g-factor may hinder future experimental advancements. In contrast, we demonstrate that lead (Pb)-based hybrid quantum devices exhibit a remarkably large and hard proximity-induced superconducting gap, exceeding that of Al by an order of magnitude. By exploiting electrostatic gating to modulate wavefunction distribution and SC-SM interfacial coupling, this gap can be continuously tuned from its maximum value (~1.4 meV, matching the bulk Pb gap) down to nearly zero while maintaining the hardness. Furthermore, magnetic-field-dependent measurements reveal a radial evolution of the gap structure with anti-crossing feature, indicative of strong SOC and huge effective g-factors up to 76. These findings underscore the superior functionality of Pb-based hybrid systems, significantly advancing their potential for realizing and stabilizing MZMs and the further scalable topological quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting (La,Pr)3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 films grown on SrLaAlO4 substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced p-d hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest potential for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Revealing isotropic abundant low-energy excitations in UTe$_2$ through complex microwave surface impedance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex surface impedance is a well-established tool to study the super- and normal-fluid responses of superconductors. Fundamental properties of the superconductor, such as the pairing mechanism, Fermi surface, and topological properties, also influence the surface impedance. We explore the microwave surface impedance of spin-triplet UTe$_2$ single crystals as a function of temperature using resonant cavity perturbation measurements employing a novel multi-modal analysis to gain insight into these properties. We determine a composite surface impedance of the crystal for each mode using resonance data combined with the independently measured normal state dc resistivity tensor. The normal state surface impedance reveals the weighting of current flow directions in the crystal of each resonant mode. For UTe$_2$, we find an isotropic $\Delta \lambda(T) \sim T^\alpha$ power-law temperature dependence for the magnetic penetration depth for $T\le T_c/3$ with $\alpha &lt; 2$, which is inconsistent with a single pair of point nodes on the Fermi surface under weak scattering. We also find a similar power-law temperature dependence for the low-temperature surface resistance $R_s(T) \sim T^{\alpha_R}$ with $\alpha_R &lt; 2$. We observe a strong anisotropy of the residual microwave loss across these modes, with some modes showing loss below the universal line-nodal value, to those showing substantially more. We compare to predictions for topological Weyl superconductivity in the context of the observed isotropic power-laws, and anisotropy of the residual loss.</description>
