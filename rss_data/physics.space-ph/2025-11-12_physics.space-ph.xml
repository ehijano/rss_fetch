      <title>Monitoring the Solar Wind Before It Reaches L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather predictions of the solar wind impacting Earth are usually first based on remote-sensing observations of the solar disc and corona, and eventually validated and/or refined with in-situ measurements taken at the Sun$-$Earth Lagrange L1 point, where real-time monitoring probes are located. However, this pipeline provides, on average, only a few tens of minutes of lead time, which decreases to $\sim$30 minutes or less for large solar wind speeds of $\sim$800 km/s and above. The G5 geomagnetic storm of 2024 May provided an opportunity to test predictions generated employing real-time data from the STEREO-A spacecraft, placed 13{\deg} west of Earth and 0.04 au closer to the Sun than L1 at the time of the event, as shown recently by Weiler et al. (2025). In this Commentary, we contextualise these results to reflect upon the advantages of measuring the solar wind in situ upstream of L1, leading to improvements in both fundamental research of interplanetary physics and space weather predictions of the near-Earth environment.</description>

      <title>Energetic Particles from Quasi-Separatrix Layers and Current Sheets at the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) at the Sun are created from regions where channels of open magnetic flux have footpoints near regions of large-scale closed magnetic flux. These regions are particularly prone to magnetic reconnection at the Sun. In recent simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model coupled to the Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Module (EPREM) model, common sources of energetic particles were discovered over broad longitudinal distributions in the background solar wind, far from the sites of particle acceleration driven by compressions and shocks in front of CMEs. Further investigation revealed these to be accelerated energetic particles from the QSLs and current sheets. The energy released from magnetic reconnection near the QSL drives reconnection exhausts and field-aligned flows, which in turn accelerate energetic particles. The reconnection process also releases material previously contained within closed magnetic field structures, which are often rich in heavy ions and $^3$He ions, as corroborated by recent PSP observations. Therefore, the seed populations produced by QSLs are expected to be rich in $^3$He and heavy ions. Thus, we present the first global model of energetic particles accelerated from QSLs and above current sheets from the Sun. Our results provide a plausible source for seed populations near the Sun, which likely have $^3$He and heavy ion enhancements. These results aid in the development of predictive solar energetic particle models.</description>

      <title>Supergranulation and Poleward Migration of the Magnetic Field at High Latitudes of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoconvection at the solar surface governs the dynamics in the upper solar atmosphere and sustains the heliosphere. Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40 Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20 m s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.</description>
