      <title>Matchings in matroids over abelian groups, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of matchings originated in group theory to address a linear algebra problem related to canonical forms for symmetric tensors. In an abelian group $(G,+)$, a matching is a bijection $f: A \to B$ between two finite subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$ such that $a + f(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. A group $G$ has the matching property if, for every two finite subsets $A, B \subset G$ of the same size with $0 \notin B$, there exists a matching from $A$ to $B$. In prior work, matroid analogues of results concerning matchings in groups were introduced and established. This paper serves as a second sequel, extending that line of inquiry by investigating paving, Panhandle, and Schubert matroids through the lens of matchability. While some proofs draw upon earlier findings on the matchability of sparse paving matroids, the paper is designed to be self-contained and accessible without reference to the preceding sequel. Our approach combines tools from both matroid theory and additive number theory.</description>

      <title>A simple proof of the existence of complete bipartite graph immersion in graphs with independence number two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadwiger's conjecture for the immersion relation posits that every graph $G$ contains an immersion of the complete graph $K_{\chi(G)}$. Vergara showed that this is equivalent to saying that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)=2$ contains an immersion of the complete graph on $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ vertices. Recently, Botler et al. showed that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)=2$ contains every complete bipartite graph on $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ vertices as an immersion. In this paper, we give a much simpler proof of this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find identities involving differential operators in the generic artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial sphere in any positive characteristic. These identities generalize the characteristic 2 identities used by Papadakis and Petrotou to give a proof of the algebraic g-conjecture. We use these identities to prove the anisotropy of certain forms on the generic artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring and to prove weak Lefschetz results.</description>

      <title>Machine Checked Proofs and Programs in Algebraic Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a library of formalized results around symmetric functions and the character theory of symmetric groups. Written in Coq/Rocq and based on the Mathematical Components library, it covers a large part of the contents of a graduate level textbook in the field. The flagship result is a proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule, which computes the structure constants of the algebra of symmetric function in the schur basis which are integer numbers appearing in various fields of mathematics, and which has a long history of wrong proofs. A specific feature of algebraic combinatorics is the constant interplay between algorithms and algebraic constructions: algorithms are not only in computations, but also are key ingredients in definitions and proofs. As such, the proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule deeply relies on the understanding of the execution of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm. Many results in this library are effective and actually used in computer algebra systems, and we discuss their certified implementation.</description>

      <title>Triangular norms on finite lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article intends to characterize triangular norms on a finite lattice. We first give a method for generating a triangular norm on an atomistic lattice by the values of atoms. Then we prove that every triangular norm on a non-Boolean atomistic lattice is not left-continuous and $T_M$ is the uniquely left-continuous triangular norm on an atomistic Boolean lattice. Furthermore, we show that each atomistic Boolean lattice can be represented by a family of triangular norms on an atomistic lattice with the same number of atoms. Finally, we construct a triangular norm on a finite lattice by restricting a triangular norm on an extended atomistic lattice of the finite lattice to the finite lattice.</description>

      <title>Punctured surfaces, quiver mutations, and quotients of Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2011, Barot and Marsh provided an explicit construction of presentation of a finite Weyl group $W$ by any quiver mutation-equivalent to an orientation of a Dynkin diagram with Weyl group $W$. The construction was extended by the authors of the present paper to obtain presentations for all affine Coxeter groups, as well as to construct groups from triangulations of unpunctured surfaces and orbifolds, where the groups are invariant under change of triangulation and thus are presented as quotients of numerous distinct Coxeter groups. We extend the construction to include most punctured surfaces and orbifolds, providing a new invariant for almost all marked surfaces.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Algorithms to Solve the $(n,k)$-Complete Hidden Subset Sum Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) involves reconstructing a hidden set from its multiple subset sums. Initially introduced as a cryptographic problem of accelerating the key generation process in some public key cryptosystems, it has recently found applications in artificial intelligence privacy-preserving research. Although the existing algorithms based on the orthogonal lattice attack perform well in certain cryptographic applications, they are not effective for addressing all instances of HSSP. In this work, we focus on designing deterministic algorithms for a special case of HSSP: For a hidden multiset $X=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}$ with elements in $\mathbb{R}$ and an integer $k\in(1,n)$, given the multiset $X_{n,k}$ consisting of all $k$-subset sum of $X$, the goal is to recover $X$. Such a problem is called the $(n,k)$-complete HSSP. Two kinds of deterministic algorithms will be proposed in this work. The first one is a brute-force search approach. In the second one, we recover $X$ by finding all the roots of the $n$-th degree polynomial whose roots are exactly the elements of $X$. We show that the coefficients of such a polynomial can be calculated from $X_{n,k}$. In addition, discussions pertaining to the Stirling partition number and the ring of homogeneous symmetric polynomials are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of polynomial inequalities in tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fundamental problems in extremal combinatorics are equivalent to proving certain polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. In 2011, a breakthrough result by Hatami and Norine showed that it is undecidable to verify polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. Recently, Blekherman, Raymond and Wei extended this result by showing that it is also undecidable to determine the validity of polynomial inequalities in homomorphism densities for weighted graphs with edge weights taking real values. These two results resolved a question of Lov\'asz. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the validity of polynomial inequalities in digraph homomorphism densities for tournaments. We prove that the answer to this problem is also undecidable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2007, Andrews and Paule introduced the family of functions $\Delta_k(n)$, which enumerate the number of broken $k$-diamond partitions for a fixed positive integer $k$. In 2013, Radu and Sellers completely characterized the parity of $\Delta_3(8n + r)$ for some $r$ and gave a conjecture on congruences modulo powers of 2 for broken 3-diamond partitions. We use an unconventional $U$-sequence to solve the revised conjecture proposed by Radu and Sellers.</description>

      <title>Hypercurveball algorithm for sampling hypergraphs with fixed degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparative analysis between a network and a random graph model can uncover network properties that significantly deviate from those in random networks. The standard random graph model used for comparison uniformly samples random graphs with the same degrees as the network data, often achieved through edge-swap algorithms. However, for hypergraphs, fewer such methodologies are available. This study introduces the Hypercurveball algorithm, designed to sample random, potentially directed, hypergraphs with fixed degrees. Minor adjustments enable the sampling of hypergraphs without degenerate hyperedges, self-loops, or multi-hyperedges. For most of these algorithms, we prove whether they sample uniformly or with bias. We experimentally show that the Hypercurveball algorithm can be significantly faster or slower than the standard hyperedge-shuffling algorithm, which is the hyperedge-equivalent of the edge-swap algorithm. We present criteria on the hypergraph degree sequence that indicate when the Hypercurveball algorithm is more efficient than the standard hyperedge swap method. Finally, our preliminary experimental results suggest polynomial scaling of the mixing time for both the Hypercurveball and hyperedge-shuffling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Covering points by hyperplanes and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb R^d$, for any $d\ge 2$, a hyperplane $h$ is called $k$-rich with respect to $P$ if it contains at least $k$ points of $P$. Answering and generalizing a question asked by Peyman Afshani, we show that if the number of $k$-rich hyperplanes in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 3$, is at least $\Omega(n^d/k^\alpha + n/k)$, with a sufficiently large constant of proportionality and with $d\le \alpha &lt; 2d-1$, then there exists a $(d-2)$-flat that contains $\Omega(k^{(2d-1-\alpha)/(d-1)})$ points of $P$. We also present upper bound constructions that give instances in which the above lower bound is tight. An extension of our analysis yields similar lower bounds for $k$-rich spheres or $k$-rich flats.</description>

      <title>Integer and Unsplittable Multiflows in Series-Parallel Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unsplittable multiflow routes the demand of each commodity along a single path from its source to its sink node. As our main result, we prove that in series-parallel digraphs, any given multiflow can be expressed as a convex combination of unsplittable multiflows, where the total flow on any arc deviates from the given flow by less than the maximum demand of any commodity. This result confirms a 25-year-old conjecture by Goemans for single-source unsplittable flows, as well as a stronger recent conjecture by Morell and Skutella, for series-parallel digraphs - even for general multiflow instances where commodities have distinct source and sink nodes. Previously, no non-trivial class of digraphs was known for which either conjecture holds. En route to proving this result, we also establish strong integrality results for multiflows on series-parallel digraphs, showing that their computation can be reduced to a simple single-commodity network flow problem.</description>

      <title>Counting minimal cutsets and $p_c&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results concerning percolation on general graphs.
  - We establish the converse of the classical Peierls argument: if the critical parameter for (uniform) percolation satisfies $p_c&lt;1$, then the number of minimal cutsets of size $n$ separating a given vertex from infinity is bounded above exponentially in $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Babson and Benjamini from 1999.
  - We prove that $p_c&lt;1$ for every uniformly transient graph. This solves a problem raised by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi, Severo and Yadin, and provides a new proof that $p_c&lt;1$ for every transitive graph of superlinear growth.</description>

Abstract: We study a model of colored multiwebs, which generalizes the dimer model to allow each vertex to be adjacent to $n_v$ edges. These objects can be formulated as a random tiling of a graph with partial dimer covers. We examine the case of a cycle graph, and in particular we describe the local correlations of tiles in this setting.</description>

      <title>Metrics for classes of semi-binary phylogenetic networks using $\mu$-representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are useful in representing the evolutionary history of taxa. In certain scenarios, one requires a way to compare different networks. In practice, this can be rather difficult, except within specific classes of networks. In this paper, we derive metrics for the class of \emph{orchard networks} and the class of \emph{strongly reticulation-visible} networks, from variants of so-called \emph{$\mu$-representations}, which are vector representations of networks. For both network classes, we impose degree constraints on the vertices, by considering \emph{semi-binary} networks.</description>

      <title>Modular lattices of finite length (Part A)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is Part A of four Parts dedicated to modular lattices of finite length. It builds on 1992 notes of the author (available on ResearchGate), and in so doing heeds a wish of the late Gian-Carlo Rota. Part A is in fairly final form and mainly features known material, exceptions being a short proof of the distributivity of congruence lattices of lattices, as well as the concept of a point-splitting (which applies to arbitrary partial linear spaces). The planned content of Parts B,C,D is given in the introduction of Part A. Suffice it to say that deep results from C.Herrmann and R.Wille will be treated in English for the first time. All of this (even Part A) is work in process and comments/contributions are welcome.</description>

      <title>Exponentiations of ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several problems regarding the partition regularity of exponential configurations have been studied in the literature, in some cases using the properties of specific ultrafilters. In this paper, we start to lay down the foundations of a general theory of exponentiations of ultrafilters, with a particular focus on their combinatorial properties and the existence of idempotents.</description>

      <title>$k$-dimensional transversals for fat convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a fractional Helly theorem for $k$-flats intersecting fat convex sets. A family $\mathcal{F}$ of sets is said to be $\rho$-fat if every set in the family contains a ball and is contained in a ball such that the ratio of the radii of these balls is bounded by $\rho$. We prove that for every dimension $d$ and positive reals $\rho$ and $\alpha$ there exists a positive $\beta=\beta(d,\rho, \alpha)$ such that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite family of $\rho$-fat convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and an $\alpha$-fraction of the $(k+2)$-size subfamilies from $\mathcal{F}$ can be hit by a $k$-flat, then there is a $k$-flat that intersects at least a $\beta$-fraction of the sets of $\mathcal{F}$. We prove spherical and colorful variants of the above results and prove a $(p,k+2)$-theorem for $k$-flats intersecting balls.</description>

      <title>Coloring minimal Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1978 Babai raised the question whether all minimal Cayley graphs have bounded chromatic number; in 1994 he conjectured a negative answer. In this paper we show that any minimal Cayley graph of a (finitely generated) generalized dihedral or nilpotent group has chromatic number at most 3, while 4 colors are sometimes necessary for soluble groups. On the other hand we address a related question proposed by Babai in 1978 by constructing graphs of unbounded chromatic number that admit a proper edge coloring such that each cycle has some color at least twice. The latter can be viewed as a step towards confirming Babai's 1994 conjecture -- a problem that remains open.</description>

      <title>Tredoku Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Donald A. Preece gave two talks in 2013, in which he introduced the notion of tredoku patterns. These are certain configurations of diamond-shaped tiles, inspired by the sukodu-like puzzle that appears in newspapers. Very sadly, Prof. Preece died in January 2014, before he was able to complete his work on this problem. This paper reconstructs his work, and settles (in the affirmative) the conjectures he proposed.</description>

      <title>An upper bound on the per-tile entropy of ribbon tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers $n$-ribbon tilings of general regions and their per-tile entropy (the binary logarithm of the number of tilings divided by the number of tiles). We show that the per-tile entropy is bounded above by $\log_2 n$. This bound improves the best previously known bounds of $n-1$ for general regions, and the asymptotic upper bound of $\log_2 (en)$ for growing rectangles, due to Chen and Kargin.</description>

      <title>A group-action Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem and applications to orchard problems in all characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a group-action version of the Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem over any field, extending Bourgain's result for the group $\mathrm{SL}_2(k)$. As an Elekes-Szab\'o-type application, we obtain quantitative bounds on the number of collinear triples on reducible cubic surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3(k)$, where $k = \mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $k = \mathbb{C}$, thereby improving a recent result by Bays, Dobrowolski, and the second author.</description>

      <title>The fractional Helly number for separable convexity spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convex lattice set in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is the intersection of a convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. A well-known theorem of Doignon states that the Helly number of $d$-dimensional convex lattice sets equals $2^d$, while a remarkable theorem of B\'ar\'any and Matou\v{s}ek states that the fractional Helly number is only $d+1$. In this paper we generalize their result to abstract convexity spaces that are equipped with a suitable separation property. We also disprove a conjecture of B\'ar\'any and Kalai about an existence of fractional Helly property for a family of solutions of bounded-degree polynomial inequalities.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Universal Obstructions for Graph Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, we introduced a parametric framework for obtaining obstruction characterizations of graph parameters with respect to a quasi-ordering $\leqslant$ on graphs. Towards this, we proposed the concepts of class obstruction, parametric obstruction, and universal obstruction as combinatorial objects that determine the approximate behaviour of a graph parameter. In this work, we explore its potential as a unifying framework for classifying graph parameters. Under this framework, we survey existing graph-theoretic results on many known graph parameters. Additionally, we provide some unifying results on their classification.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic density of $k$-tuples of positive integers with pairwise non-coprime components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the convolution method for arithmetic functions of several variables to deduce an asymptotic formula for the number of $k$-tuples of positive integers with components which are pairwise non-coprime and $\le x$. More generally, we obtain asymptotic formulas on the number of $k$-tuples $(n_1,\ldots,n_k)\in {\Bbb N}^k$ such that at least $r$ pairs $(n_i,n_j)$, respectively exactly $r$ pairs are coprime. Our results answer the questions raised by Moree (2005, 2014), and generalize and refine related results obtained by Heyman (2014) and Hu (2014).</description>

      <title>On Functional Dimension and Persistent Pseudodimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any fixed feedforward ReLU neural network architecture, it is well-known that many different parameter settings can determine the same function. It is less well-known that the degree of this redundancy is inhomogeneous across parameter space. In this work, we discuss two locally applicable complexity measures for ReLU network classes and what we know about the relationship between them: (1) the local functional dimension [14, 18], and (2) a local version of VC dimension that we call persistent pseudodimension. The former is easy to compute on finite batches of points; the latter should give local bounds on the generalization gap, which would inform an understanding of the mechanics of the double descent phenomenon [7].</description>

      <title>Characters of symmetric groups: sharp bounds on virtual degrees and the Witten zeta function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the virtual degrees introduced by Larsen and Shalev. This leads to improved bounds on characters of symmetric groups. We then sharpen bounds of Liebeck and Shalev concerning the Witten zeta function. Our main application is a characterization of the fixed-point free conjugacy classes whose associated random walk mixes in 2 steps.</description>

      <title>On Halin's end-degree Conjecture and $\omega$-strong cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new instances of \emph{Halin's end degree conjecture} within $\mathrm{ZFC}$. In particular, we prove that there is a proper class of cardinals $\kappa$ for which Haliln's end-degree conjecture holds. This answers two questions posed by Geschke, Kurkofka, Melcher and Pitz in 2023. Furthermore, we comment on the relationship between Halin's conjecture and the \emph{Singular Cardinal Hypothesis}, deriving consistency strength from failures of the former. We also show that Halin's conjecture fails on finite intervals of successors of singular cardinals in Meremovich's model.</description>
