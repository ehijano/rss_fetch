      <title>Speed-accuracy tradeoff and its effect in the game of cricket: predictive modeling from statistical mechanics perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speed-accuracy tradeoffs are prevalent in a wide range of physical systems. In this paper, we demonstrate speed-accuracy tradeoffs in the game of cricket, where 'batters' score runs on the balls bowled by the 'bowlers'. It is shown that the run scoring rate by a batter and the probability of dismissal follow a power-law relation. Due to availability of extensive data, game of cricket is an excellent model for the study of the effect of speed-accuracy tradeoff on the overall performance of the system. It is shown that the exponent of the power-law governs the nature of the adaptability of the player in different conditions and can be used for their assessment. Further, it is demonstrated that the players with extreme values of the power-law exponent are better suited for different playing conditions as compared to the ones with moderate values. These findings can be utilized to identify the potential of the cricket players for different game formats and can further help team management in devising strategies for the best outcomes with a given set of players.</description>

      <title>Heider balance on Archimedean lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Heider (structural) balance is known for a long time (P. Bonacich and P. Lu, Introduction to Mathematical Sociology, Princeton UP, 2012). Yet it attracts attention of numerous computational scholars, as it is an example of a macroscopic ordering which emerges as a consequence of local interactions. In this paper, we investigate the thermal evolution (driven by thermal noise level $T$) of the work function $U(T)$ for Heider balance on several Archimedean lattices that contain separated triangles, pairs of triangles, chains of triangles and complex structures of triangles. To that end, the heat-bath algorithm is applied. Two schemes of link values updating are considered: synchronous and asynchronous. In the latter case, the analytical formula $U(T)=-\tanh(1/T)$ based on the partition function is provided. The Archimedean lattices are encoded with adjacency matrices, and Fortran procedures for their construction are provided. Finally, we present the mathematical proof that for any two-dimensional lattice, perfect structural (Heider) balance is unreachable at $T&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Women for Quantum -- Manifesto of Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data show that the presence of women in quantum science is affected by a number of detriments and their percentage decreases even further for higher positions. Beyond data, from our shared personal experiences as female tenured quantum physics professors, we believe that the current model of scientific leadership, funding, and authority fails to represent many of us. It is time for a real change that calls for a different kind of force and for the participation of everyone. Women for quantum calls for a joint effort and aims with this initiative to contribute to such a transformation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of An Information Theoretic Analog of Two Masses on a Spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we investigate an information theoretic analogue of the classic two masses on spring system, arising from a physical interpretation of Friston's free energy principle in the theory of learning in a system of agents. Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds, we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents' beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function is defined using the Jeffrey's divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by a non-linear spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information theoretic control problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stable approach to altering an agent's belief than providing a slowly changing belief state that approaches the target.</description>

      <title>A 72h exploration of the co-evolution of food insecurity and international migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food insecurity, defined as the lack of physical or economic access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, remains one of the main challenges of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Food insecurity is a complex phenomenon, resulting from the interplay of environmental, socio-demographic, and political events. Previous work has investigated the nexus between climate change, conflict, migration and food security at the household level, however these relations are still largely unexplored at national scales. In this context, during the Complexity72h workshop, held at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in June 2024, we explored the co-evolution of international migration flows and food insecurity at the national scale, accounting for remittances, as well as for changes in the economic, conflict, and climate situation. To this aim, we gathered data from several publicly available sources (Food and Agriculture Organization, World Bank, and UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) and analyzed the association between food insecurity and migration, migration and remittances, and remittances and food insecurity. We then propose a framework linking together these associations to model the co-evolution of food insecurity and international migrations.</description>

      <title>Scientific Text Analysis with Robots applied to observatory proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To test the potential disruptive effect of Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformers (e.g., ChatGPT) and their associated Large Language Models on the time allocation process, both in proposal reviewing and grading, an experiment has been set-up at ESO for the P112 Call for Proposals. The experiment aims at raising awareness in the ESO community and build valuable knowledge by identifying what future steps ESO and other observatories might need to take to stay up to date with current technologies. We present here the results of the experiment, which may further be used to inform decision-makers regarding the use of AI in the proposal review process. We find that the ChatGPT-adjusted proposals tend to receive lower grades compared to the original proposals. Moreover, ChatGPT 3.5 can generally not be trusted in providing correct scientific references, while the most recent version makes a better, but far from perfect, job. We also studied how ChatGPT deals with assessing proposals. It does an apparent remarkable job at providing a summary of ESO proposals, although it doesn't do so good to identify weaknesses. When looking at how it evaluates proposals, however, it appears that ChatGPT systematically gives a higher mark than humans, and tends to prefer proposals written by itself.</description>

      <title>Protection Degree and Migration in the Stochastic SIRS Model: A Queueing System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the prevalence of COVID-19, the modeling of epidemic propagation and its analyses have played a significant role in controlling epidemics. However, individual behaviors, in particular the self-protection and migration, which have a strong influence on epidemic propagation, were always neglected in previous studies. In this paper, we mainly propose two models from the individual and population perspectives. In the first individual model, we introduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the epidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative population model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate the individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving population network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are applied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected probability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited distribution are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Multi-topic belief formation through bifurcations over signed social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a nonlinear dynamic model of continuous-time multi-dimensional belief formation over signed social networks. Our model accounts for the effects of a structured belief system, self-appraisal, internal biases, and various sources of cognitive dissonance posited by recent theories in social psychology. We prove that agents become opinionated as a consequence of a bifurcation. We analyze how the balance of social network effects in the model controls the nature of the bifurcation and, therefore, the belief-forming limit-set solutions. Our analysis provides constructive conditions on how multi-stable network belief equilibria and belief oscillations emerging at a belief-forming bifurcation depend on the communication network graph and belief system network graph. Our model and analysis provide new theoretical insights on the dynamics of social systems and a new principled framework for designing decentralized decision-making on engineered networks in the presence of structured relationships among alternatives.</description>

      <title>Steering cooperation: Adversarial attacks on prisoner's dilemma in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the application of adversarial attack concepts to control the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks. Specifically, it proposes a simple adversarial attack method that drives players' strategies towards a target state by adding small perturbations to social networks. The proposed method is evaluated on both model and real-world networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively promote cooperation with significantly smaller perturbations compared to other techniques. Additionally, this study shows that adversarial attacks can also be useful in inhibiting cooperation (promoting defection). The findings reveal that adversarial attacks on social networks can be potent tools for both promoting and inhibiting cooperation, opening new possibilities for controlling cooperative behavior in social systems while also highlighting potential risks.</description>

      <title>Diameter of Compact Riemann Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diameter is one of the most basic properties of a geometric object, while Riemann surfaces are one of the most basic geometric objects. Surprisingly, the diameter of compact Riemann surfaces is known exactly only for the sphere and the torus. For higher genuses, only very general but loose upper and lower bounds are available. The problem of calculating the diameter exactly has been intractable since there is no simple expression for the distance between a pair of points on a high-genus surface. Here we prove that the diameters of a class of simple Riemann surfaces known as generalized Bolza surfaces of any genus greater than $1$ are equal to the radii of their fundamental polygons. This is the first exact result for the diameter of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy in dynamic complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of complex networks studies a wide variety of interacting systems by representing them as networks. To understand their properties and mutual relations, the randomisation of network connections is a commonly used tool. However, information theoretic-based randomisation methods with well-established foundations mostly provide a stationary description of these systems, while stochastic randomisation methods that account for their dynamic nature lack such general foundations and require extensive repetition of the stochastic process to measure statistical properties. In this work, we extend the applicability of information-theoretic methods beyond stationary network models. By using the information-theoretic principle of maximum caliber we construct dynamic network ensemble distributions based on constraints representing statistical properties with known values throughout the evolution. We focus on the particular cases of dynamics constrained by the average number of connections of the whole network and each node, comparing each evolution to simulations of stochastic randomisation that obey the same constraints. We find that ensemble distributions estimated from simulations match those calculated with maximum caliber and that the equilibrium distributions to which they converge agree with known results of maximum entropy given the same constraints. Finally, we discuss further the connections to other maximum entropy approaches to network dynamics and conclude by proposing some possible avenues of future research.</description>
