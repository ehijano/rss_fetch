      <title>Sensing-Assisted Beam Tracking with Real-Time Beamwidth Adaptation for THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communications, with their substantial bandwidth, are essential for meeting the ultra-high data rate demands of emerging high-mobility scenarios such as vehicular-to-everything (V2X) networks. In these contexts, beamwidth adaptation has been explored to address the problem that high-mobility targets frequently move out of the narrow THz beam range. However, existing approaches cannot effectively track targets due to a lack of real-time motion awareness. Consequently, we propose a sensing-assisted beam tracking scheme with real-time beamwidth adaptation. Specifically, the base station (BS) periodically collects prior sensing information to predict the target's motion path by applying a particular motion model. Then, we build a pre-calculated codebook by optimising precoders to align the beamwidth with various predicted target paths, thereby maximising the average achievable data rates within each sensing period. Finally, the BS selects the optimal precoder from the codebook to maintain stable and continuous connectivity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the rate performance and reduces outage probability compared to existing approaches under various target mobility.</description>

      <title>Impact of Reflectors and MIMO on ML-Aided mmWave/sub-THz Blockage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communication systems is significantly impaired by sensitivity to sudden blockages. In this work, we employ machine learning (ML) and our physics-based simulation tool to warn about the upcoming blockage tens of 5G frames ahead for highway speeds, providing a sufficient time for a proactive response. Performance of this ML-aided early-warning-of-blockage (ML-EW) algorithm is analyzed for realistic outdoor mobile environments with diverse reflectors and antenna arrays placed at the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) over a range of mmWave and sub-THz frequencies. ML accuracy of about 90% or higher is demonstrated for highway UE, blocker, and reflector speeds, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and frequencies in mmWave/sub-THz range.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Characterize Dynamics of ECG-Derived Skin Nerve Activity via Time-Varying Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessment of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the major approaches for studying affective states. Skin nerve activity (SKNA) derived from high-frequency components of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has been a promising surrogate for assessing the SNS. However, current SKNA analysis tools have shown high variability across study protocols and experiments. Hence, we propose a time-varying spectral approach based on SKNA to assess the SNS with higher sensitivity and reliability. We collected ECG signals at a sampling frequency of 10 KHz from sixteen subjects who underwent various SNS stimulations. Our spectral analysis revealed that frequency bands between 150 - 1,000 Hz showed significant increases in power during SNS stimulations. Using this information, we developed a time-varying index of sympathetic function measurement based on SKNA, termed, Time-Varying Skin Nerve Activity (TVSKNA). TVSKNA is calculated in three steps: time-frequency decomposition, reconstruction using selected frequency bands, and smoothing. TVSKNA indices exhibited generally higher Youden's J, balanced accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, indicating higher sensitivity. The coefficient of variance was lower with TVSKNA indices for most SNS tasks. TVSKNA can serve as a highly sensitive and reliable marker of quantitative assessment of sympathetic function, especially during emotion and stress.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Guided Noise Reduction for Automatic Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) has emerged as a key technique in cognitive radio networks in sixth-generation (6G) communications. AMC enables effective data transmission without requiring prior knowledge of modulation schemes. However, the low classification accuracy under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limits the implementation of AMC techniques under the rapidly changing physical channels in 6G and beyond. This paper investigates the AMC technique for the signals with dynamic and varying SNRs, and a deep learning based noise reduction network is proposed to reduce the noise introduced by the wireless channel and the receiving equipment. In particular, a transfer learning guided learning framework (TNR-AMC) is proposed to utilize the scarce annotated modulation signals and improve the classification accuracy for low SNR modulation signals. The numerical results show that the proposed noise reduction network achieves an accuracy improvement of over 20\% in low SNR scenarios, and the TNR-AMC framework can improve the classification accuracy under unstable SNRs.</description>

      <title>FAS-Driven Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive radio (CR) networks face significant challenges in spectrum sensing, especially under spectrum scarcity. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) can offer an unorthodox solution due to their ability to dynamically adjust antenna positions for improved channel gain. In this letter, we study a FAS-driven CR setup where a secondary user (SU) adjusts the positions of fluid antennas to detect signals from the primary user (PU). We aim to maximize the detection probability under the constraints of the false alarm probability and the received beamforming of the SU. To address this problem, we first derive a closed-form expression for the optimal detection threshold and reformulate the problem to find its solution. Then an alternating optimization (AO) scheme is proposed to decompose the problem into several sub-problems, addressing both the received beamforming and the antenna positions at the SU. The beamforming subproblem is addressed using a closed-form solution, while the fluid antenna positions are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm provides significant improvements over traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) schemes in terms of spectrum sensing performance.</description>

      <title>A Secure Beamforming Design: When Fluid Antenna Meets NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a secure beamforming design for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems utilizing fluid antenna systems (FAS). We consider a setup where a base station (BS) with $M$ fluid antennas (FAs) communicates to a cell-center user (CU) and a cell-edge user (CEU), each with a FA. The CU is the intended recipient while the CEU is regarded as a potential eavesdropper. Our aim is to maximize the achievable secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the secure beamforming vectors and the positions of FAs. To tackle this, we adopt an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that optimizes secure beamforming and the positions of the FAs iteratively while keeping the other variables fixed. Numerical results illustrate that when FAs meet NOMA, the proposed scheme greatly enhances the secrecy rate compared to conventional multiple-input single-output (MISO) fixed antenna NOMA systems and other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Reducing Dynamic Range in Bistatic Backscatter Communication via Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the exponential growth of Internet-of-Things devices and the goals toward sustainable networks, the complexity should be focused on the infrastructure side. For a massive number of passive devices, backscatter communication (BC) is a promising technology that reduces cost and increases energy efficiency by enabling transmitting information by backscattering radio frequency signals. Two main limitations that restrict the performance of BC are the round-trip path loss effect and the direct link interference (DLI) from the carrier emitter (CE). To circumvent this, we propose a novel transmit beamforming design for a multiple antenna bistatic BC (BiBC) system that realizes both purposes: mitigation of the DLI and increasing the power towards the backscatter device (BD). Additionally, we provide a detector design and the performance is evaluated in terms of the probability of error, for which we also provide a closed-form expression. Finally, simulation results show the superiority of the proposed beamforming design in decreasing DLI over a benchmark scenario that considers maximum-ratio transmission.</description>

      <title>Advanced Nonlinear SCMA Codebook Design Based on Lattice Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of efficient sparse codebooks in sparse code multiple access (SCMA) system have attracted tremendous research attention in the past few years. This paper proposes a novel nonlinear SCMA (NL-SCMA) that can subsume the conventional SCMA system which is referred to as linear SCMA, as special cases for downlink channels. This innovative approach allows a direct mapping of users' messages to a superimposed codeword for transmission, eliminating the need of a codebook for each user. This mapping is referred to as nonlinear mapping (codebook) in this paper.
  Hence, the primary objective is to design the nonlinear mapping, rather than the linear codebook for each user. We leverage the Lattice constellation to design the superimposed constellation due to its advantages such as the minimum Euclidean distance (MED), constellation volume, design flexibility and shape gain. Then, by analyzing the error patterns of the Lattice-designed superimposed codewords with the aid of the pair-wise error probability, it is found that the MED of the proposed nonlinear codebook is lower bounded by the ``single error pattern''. To this end, an error pattern-inspired codebook design is proposed, which can achieve large MEDs of the nonlinear codebooks. Numerical results show that the proposed codebooks can achieve lower error rate performance over both Gaussian and Rayleigh fading channels than the-state-of-the-art linear codebooks.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Deep Schedulers for Allocating Cellular Radio Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are often suggested to address wireless network functions, such as radio packet scheduling. However, a feasible 3GPP-compliant scheduler capable of delivering fair throughput across users, while keeping a low computational complexity for 5G and beyond is still missing. To address this, we first take a critical look at previous deep scheduler efforts. Secondly, we enhance State-of-the-Art (SoTA) deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and adapt them to train our deep scheduler. In particular, we propose novel training techniques for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a new Distributional Soft Actor-Critic Discrete (DSACD) algorithm, which outperformed other tested variants. These improvements were achieved while maintaining minimal actor network complexity, making them suitable for real-time computing environments. Additionally, the entropy learning in SACD was fine-tuned to accommodate resource allocation action spaces of varying sizes. Our proposed deep schedulers exhibited strong generalization across different bandwidths, number of MU-MIMO layers, and traffic models. Ultimately, we show that our pre-trained deep schedulers outperform their heuristic rivals in realistic and standard-compliant 5G system-level simulations.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Modeling and Capacity Analysis of Rydberg Atom-Based MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom-based antennas exploit the quantum properties of highly excited Rydberg atoms, providing unique advantages over classical antennas, such as high sensitivity, broad frequency range, and compact size. Despite the increasing interests in their applications in antenna and communication engineering, two key properties, involving the lack of polarization multiplexing and isotropic reception without mutual coupling, remain unexplored in the analysis of Rydberg atom-based spatial multiplexing, i.e., multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO), communications. Generally, the design considerations for any antenna, even for atomic ones, can be extracted to factors such as radiation patterns, efficiency, and polarization, allowing them to be seamlessly integrated into existing system models. In this letter, we extract the antenna properties from relevant quantum characteristics, enabling electromagnetic modeling and capacity analysis of Rydberg MIMO systems in both far-field and near-field scenarios. By employing ray-based method for far-field analysis and dyadic Green's function for near-field calculation, our results indicate that Rydberg atom-based antenna arrays offer specific advantages over classical dipole-type arrays in single-polarization MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Algorithms For Signature Diagnostics Of Three-Phase Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the intelligent diagnosis of three-phase engines has the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic performance and accuracy. Traditional methods largely rely on signature analysis, which, despite being a standard practice, can benefit from the integration of advanced ML techniques. In our study, we innovate by combining state of the art algorithms with a novel unsupervised anomaly generation methodology that takes into account physics model of the engine. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both supervised ML and unsupervised signature analysis, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy and reliability along with a wide industrial application. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms existing ML and non-ML state-of-the-art approaches while retaining the practical advantages of an unsupervised methodology. The findings highlight the potential of our approach to significantly contribute to the field of engine diagnostics, offering a robust and efficient solution for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Time-constrained Federated Learning (FL) in Push-Pull IoT Wireless Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a high-quality Federated Learning (FL) model at the network edge is challenged by limited transmission resources. Although various device scheduling strategies have been proposed, it remains unclear how scheduling decisions affect the FL model performance under temporal constraints. This is pronounced when the wireless medium is shared to enable the participation of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with distinct communication modes: (1) a scheduling (pull) scheme, that selects devices with valuable updates, and (2) random access (push), in which interested devices transmit model parameters. The motivation for pushing data is the improved representation of own data distribution within the trained FL model and thereby better generalization. The scheduling strategy affects the transmission opportunities for push-based communication during the access phase, extending the number of communication rounds required for model convergence. This work investigates the interplay of push-pull interactions in a time-constrained FL setting, where the communication opportunities are finite, with a utility-based analytical model. Using real-world datasets, we provide a performance tradeoff analysis that validates the significance of strategic device scheduling under push-pull wireless access for several practical settings. The simulation results elucidate the impact of the device sampling strategy on learning efficiency under timing constraints.</description>

      <title>TDGCN-Based Mobile Multiuser Physical-Layer Authentication for EI-Enabled IIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) offers endogenous security, lightweight implementation, and high reliability, making it a promising complement to upper-layer security methods in Edge Intelligence (EI)-empowered Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, state-of-the-art Channel State Information (CSI)-based PLA schemes face challenges in recognizing mobile multi-users due to the limited reliability of CSI fingerprints in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments and the constantly shifting CSI distributions with user movements. To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (TDGCN)-based PLA scheme. This scheme harnesses Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) to refine CSI fingerprint precision and employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics induced by user movements and IRS deployments. Specifically, we partition hierarchical CSI fingerprints into multivariate time series and utilize dynamic GNNs to capture their associations. Additionally, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) handle temporal dependencies within each CSI fingerprint dimension. Dynamic Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) and cascade node clustering pooling further enable efficient information aggregation and reduced computational complexity. Simulations demonstrate the proposed scheme's superior authentication accuracy compared to seven baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</description>

Abstract: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) is a major cardiovascular risk factor, linked to heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death, often resulting from chronic stress like hypertension. Electrocardiography (ECG), while varying in sensitivity, is widely accessible and cost-effective for detecting LVH-related morphological changes. This work introduces a bilateral signal warping (BSW) approach to improve ECG-based LVH diagnosis. Our method creates a library of heartbeat prototypes from patients with consistent ECG patterns. After preprocessing to eliminate baseline wander and detect R peaks, we apply BSW to cluster heartbeats, generating prototypes for both normal and LVH classes. We compare each new record to these references to support diagnosis. Experimental results show promising potential for practical application in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Coverage Analysis for Digital Cousin Selection -- Improving Multi-Environment Q-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-learning is widely employed for optimizing various large-dimensional networks with unknown system dynamics. Recent advancements include multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithms, which utilize multiple independent Q-learning algorithms across multiple, structurally related but distinct environments and outperform several state-of-the-art Q-learning algorithms in terms of accuracy, complexity, and robustness. We herein conduct a comprehensive probabilistic coverage analysis to ensure optimal data coverage conditions for MEMQ algorithms. First, we derive upper and lower bounds on the expectation and variance of different coverage coefficients (CC) for MEMQ algorithms. Leveraging these bounds, we develop a simple way of comparing the utilities of multiple environments in MEMQ algorithms. This approach appears to be near optimal versus our previously proposed partial ordering approach. We also present a novel CC-based MEMQ algorithm to improve the accuracy and complexity of existing MEMQ algorithms. Numerical experiments are conducted using random network graphs with four different graph properties. Our algorithm can reduce the average policy error (APE) by 65% compared to partial ordering and is 95% faster than the exhaustive search. It also achieves 60% less APE than several state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and prior MEMQ algorithms. Additionally, we numerically verify the theoretical results and show their scalability with the action-space size.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Graph Construction Using Non-local Cluster Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a multiscale graph construction method using both graph and signal features. Multiscale graph is a hierarchical representation of the graph, where a node at each level indicates a cluster in a finer resolution. To obtain the hierarchical clusters, existing methods often use graph clustering; however, they may ignore signal variations. As a result, these methods could fail to detect the clusters having similar features on nodes. In this paper, we consider graph and node-wise features simultaneously for multiscale clustering of a graph. With given clusters of the graph, the clusters are merged hierarchically in three steps: 1) Feature vectors in the clusters are extracted. 2) Similarities among cluster features are calculated using optimal transport. 3) A variable $k$-nearest neighbor graph (V$k$NNG) is constructed and graph spectral clustering is applied to the V$k$NNG to obtain clusters at a coarser scale. Additionally, the multiscale graph in this paper has \textit{non-local} characteristics: Nodes with similar features are merged even if they are spatially separated. In experiments on multiscale image and point cloud segmentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimization for Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08411v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS)/movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model, as a simplified implementation of six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA), to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the proposed RA system can independently and flexibly change the three-dimensional (3D) orientation of each antenna by adjusting its declination angles to achieve desired channel realizations. Specifically, we study an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the declination angles of all RAs are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal declination angles are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the base station (BS). In the general multi-user and multi-path setup, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the declination angles in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RA-enabled system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Fractional Fourier Domain PAPR Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) has long posed a challenge for multi-carrier systems, impacting amplifier efficiency and overall system performance. This paper introduces dynamic angle fractional Fourier division multiplexing (DA-FrFDM), an innovative multi-carrier system that effectively reduces PAPR for both QAM and Gaussian signals with minimal signaling overhead. DA-FrFDM leverages the fractional Fourier domain to balance PAPR characteristics between the time and frequency domains, achieving significant PAPR reduction while preserving signal quality. Furthermore, DA-FrFDM refines signal processing and enables one-tap equalization in the fractional Fourier domain through the simple multiplication of time-domain signals by a quadratic phase sequence. Our results show that DA-FrFDM not only outperforms existing PAPR reduction techniques but also retains efficient inter-carrier interference (ICI) mitigation capabilities in doubly dispersive channels.</description>

      <title>State-Space Estimation of Spatially Dynamic Room Impulse Responses using a Room Acoustic Model-based Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of room impulse responses (RIRs) between static loudspeaker and microphone locations can be done using a number of well-established measurement and inference procedures. While these procedures assume a time-invariant acoustic system, time variations need to be considered for the case of spatially dynamic scenarios where loudspeakers and microphones are subject to movement. If the RIR is modeled using image sources, then movement implies that the distance to each image source varies over time, making the estimation of the spatially dynamic RIR particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a procedure to estimate the early part of the spatially dynamic RIR between a stationary source and a microphone moving on a linear trajectory at constant velocity. The procedure is built upon a state-space model, where the state to be estimated represents the early RIR, the observation corresponds to a microphone recording in a spatially dynamic scenario, and time-varying distances to the image sources are incorporated into the state transition matrix obtained from static RIRs at the start and end point of the trajectory. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art RIR interpolation and state-space estimation methods using simulations, demonstrating the potential of the proposed state-space model.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for Movable Antenna-Aided Downlink RSMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08509v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is regarded as a crucial and powerful physical layer (PHY) paradigm for next-generation communication systems. Particularly, users employ successive interference cancellation (SIC) to decode part of the interference while treating the remainder as noise. However, conventional RSMA systems rely on fixed-position antenna arrays, limiting their ability to fully exploit spatial diversity. This constraint reduces beamforming gain and significantly impairs RSMA performance. To address this problem, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-aided RSMA scheme that allows the antennas at the base station (BS) to dynamically adjust their positions. Our objective is to maximize the system sum rate of common and private messages by jointly optimizing the MA positions, beamforming matrix, and common rate allocation. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we apply fractional programming (FP) and develop an efficient two-stage, coarse-to-fine-grained searching (CFGS) algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that, with optimized antenna adjustments, the MA-enabled system achieves substantial performance and reliability improvements in RSMA over fixed-position antenna setups.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Robust Lossy Compression of Heavy-Tailed Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rate-distortion problem for both scalar and vector memoryless heavy-tailed $\alpha$-stable sources ($0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$). Using a recently defined notion of ``strength" as a power measure, we derive the rate-distortion function for $\alpha$-stable sources subject to a constraint on the strength of the error, and show it to be logarithmic in the strength-to-distortion ratio. We showcase how our framework paves the way to finding optimal quantizers for $\alpha$-stable sources and more generally to heavy-tailed ones. In addition, we study high-rate scalar quantizers and show that uniform ones are asymptotically optimal under the strength measure. We compare uniform Gaussian and Cauchy quantizers and show that more representation points for the Cauchy source are required to guarantee the same quantization quality. Our findings generalize the well-known rate-distortion and quantization results of Gaussian sources ($\alpha = 2$) under a quadratic distortion measure.</description>

      <title>Joint Model Caching and Resource Allocation in Generative AI-Enabled Wireless Edge Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative tool, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. However, GenAI models with billions of parameters require substantial memory capacity and computational power for deployment and execution, presenting significant challenges to resource-limited edge networks. In this paper, we address the joint model caching and resource allocation problem in GenAI-enabled wireless edge networks. Our objective is to balance the trade-off between delivering high-quality AIGC and minimizing the delay in AIGC service provisioning. To tackle this problem, we employ a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning approach, capable of efficiently determining optimal model caching and resource allocation decisions for AIGC services in response to user mobility and time-varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that DDPG achieves a higher model hit ratio and provides superior-quality, lower-latency AIGC services compared to other benchmark solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining widespread use in wireless relay systems due to their exceptional flexibility and cost-effectiveness. This paper focuses on the integrated design of UAV trajectories and the precoders at both the transmitter and UAV in a UAV-assisted relay communication system, accounting for transmit power constraints and UAV flight limitations. Unlike previous works that primarily address multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with Gaussian inputs, we investigate a more realistic scenario involving multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite-alphabet inputs. To tackle the challenging and inherently non-convex problem, we propose an efficient solution algorithm that leverages successive convex approximation and alternating optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its capability to optimize system performance.</description>

      <title>High-resolution optical and acoustic remote sensing datasets of the Puck Lagoon, Southern Baltic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very shallow marine basin of Puck Lagoon in the southern Baltic Sea, on the Northern coast of Poland, hosts valuable benthic habitats and cultural heritage sites. These include, among others, protected Zostera marina meadows, one of the Baltic's major medieval harbours, a ship graveyard, and likely other submerged features that are yet to be discovered. Prior to this project, no comprehensive high-resolution remote sensing data were available for this area. This article describes the first Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from a combination of airborne bathymetric LiDAR, multibeam echosounder, airborne photogrammetry and satellite imagery. These datasets also include multibeam echosounder backscatter and LiDAR intensity, allowing determination of the character and properties of the seafloor. Combined, these datasets are a vital resource for assessing and understanding seafloor morphology, benthic habitats, cultural heritage, and submerged landscapes. Given the significance of Puck Lagoon's hydrographical, ecological, geological, and archaeological environs, the high-resolution bathymetry, acquired by our project, can provide the foundation for sustainable management and informed decision-making for this area of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Large Wireless Model (LWM) -- the world's first foundation model for wireless channels. Designed as a task-agnostic model, LWM generates universal, rich, contextualized channel embeddings (features) that potentially enhance performance across a wide range of downstream tasks in wireless communication and sensing systems. Towards this objective, LWM, which has a transformer-based architecture, was pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on large-scale wireless channel datasets. Our results show consistent improvements in classification and regression tasks when using the LWM embeddings compared to raw channel representations, especially in scenarios with high-complexity machine learning tasks and limited training datasets. This LWM's ability to learn from large-scale wireless data opens a promising direction for intelligent systems that can efficiently adapt to diverse tasks with limited data, paving the way for addressing key challenges in wireless communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Beampattern Design for Transmit Architectures Based on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of beampattern design for a transmit architecture wherein a large reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) redirects the radio frequency signals emitted by a few active antennas (sources). After introducing a convenient signal model and discussing the impact of the signal bandwidth, the source-RIS channel, and the system geometry on the involved derivations, we propose to optimize the waveform emitted by each source and the phase shifts introduced by the RIS to match a desired space-frequency distribution of the far-field radiation pattern, which may be relevant in both radar and communication applications. We provide a sub-optimum solution to the considered problem under a constraint on the total power radiated by the sources and, possibly, on the constant modulus of the involved waveforms. The reported example demonstrates that the beampattern of an RIS-based transmit architecture can be well shaped; in particular, for the same array size and the same desired radiation pattern, the resulting approximation error remains comparable to that obtained with a fully-digital MIMO array, especially when constant-modulus waveforms are required, and smaller than that obtained with a phased array.</description>

      <title>OFDM Reference Signal Pattern Design Criteria for Integrated Communication and Sensing</title>

Abstract: Extended ambiguity performance (EAP), which includes all grating lobes and side peaks, indicates the maximum detectable region without undesired peaks for target parameter estimation and is critical to radar sensor design. Driven by EAP requirements of bi-static sensing, we propose design criteria for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) reference signal (RS) patterns. The design not only improves EAP in both time delay and Doppler shift domains under different types of sensing algorithms, but also reduces resource overhead for integrated communication and sensing. With minimal modifications of post-FFT processing for current RS patterns, guard interval is extended beyond conventional cyclic prefix (CP), while maintaining inter-symbol-interference-(ISI)-free delay estimation. For standard-resolution sensing algorithms, a staggering offset of a linear slope that is relatively prime to the RS comb size is suggested. As for super-resolution sensing algorithms, necessary and sufficient conditions of comb RS staggering offsets, plus new patterns synthesized therefrom, are derived for the corresponding achievable EAP. Furthermore, we generalize the RS pattern design criterion for super-resolution sensing algorithms to irregular forms, which minimizes number of resource elements (REs) for associated algorithms to eliminate all side peaks. Starting from staggered comb pattern in current positioning RS, our generalized design eventually removes any regular form for ultimate flexibility. Overall, the proposed techniques are promising to extend the ISI- and ambiguity-free range of distance and speed estimates for radar sensing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hemodynamic Parameter Estimations: Nonlinear Blood Behavior in 4D Flow MRI</title>

Abstract: Hemodynamic parameters are often estimated assuming a constant Newtonian viscosity, even though blood exhibits shear-thinning behavior. This article investigates the influence of blood rheology and hematocrit (Hct) percentage on the estimation of Wall Shear Stress (WSS), rate of viscous Energy Loss ($\dot{E}_L$) at different points in the cardiac cycle, and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI). We focus on a hematocrit-dependent power-law non-Newtonian model, considering a wide range of Hct values at physiological temperature, with rheological parameters obtained from previously reported experimental data. In all cases, we systematically compared WSS, $\dot{E}_L$, and OSI using both Newtonian and power-law models, underscoring the crucial role of blood rheology in accurately assessing cardiovascular diseases. Our results show that, in in-silico experiments, differences in WSS and $\dot{E}_L$ across a wide range of Hct values can reach as high as 190\% and 113\% at systole, and as low as -72\% and -74\% at diastole, respectively. In in-vivo data, differences in WSS and $\dot{E}_L$ can reach up to -45\% and -60\% at systole, and range from -69\% to 73\% at diastole. This study enhances our understanding of the impact of blood rheology on hemodynamic parameter estimations using both in-silico and in-vivo aortic 4D Flow MRI data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of multiple extended targets in complex environments using high-resolution automotive radar is considered. A data-driven approach is proposed where unlabeled synchronized lidar data is used as ground truth to train a neural network with only radar data as input. To this end, the novel, large-scale, real-life, and multi-sensor RaDelft dataset has been recorded using a demonstrator vehicle in different locations in the city of Delft. The dataset, as well as the documentation and example code, is publicly available for those researchers in the field of automotive radar or machine perception. The proposed data-driven detector is able to generate lidar-like point clouds using only radar data from a high-resolution system, which preserves the shape and size of extended targets. The results are compared against conventional CFAR detectors as well as variations of the method to emulate the available approaches in the literature, using the probability of detection, the probability of false alarm, and the Chamfer distance as performance metrics. Moreover, an ablation study was carried out to assess the impact of Doppler and temporal information on detection performance. The proposed method outperforms the different baselines in terms of Chamfer distance, achieving a reduction of 75% against conventional CFAR detectors and 10% against the modified state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Fluid Antenna System for 6G Networks: Encompassing Communication Theory, Optimization Methods and Hardware Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of the sixth-generation (6G) networks presents another round of revolution for the mobile communication landscape, promising an immersive experience, robust reliability, minimal latency, extreme connectivity, ubiquitous coverage, and capabilities beyond communication, including intelligence and sensing. To achieve these ambitious goals, it is apparent that 6G networks need to incorporate the state-of-the-art technologies. One of the technologies that has garnered rising interest is fluid antenna system (FAS) which represents any software-controllable fluidic, conductive, or dielectric structure capable of dynamically changing its shape and position to reconfigure essential radio-frequency (RF) characteristics. Compared to traditional antenna systems (TASs) with fixed-position radiating elements, the core idea of FAS revolves around the unique flexibility of reconfiguring the radiating elements within a given space. One recent driver of FAS is the recognition of its position-flexibility as a new degree of freedom (dof) to harness diversity and multiplexing gains. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive tutorial, covering channel modeling, signal processing and estimation methods, information-theoretic insights, new multiple access techniques, and hardware designs. Moreover, we delineate the challenges of FAS and explore the potential of using FAS to improve the performance of other contemporary technologies. By providing insights and guidance, this tutorial paper serves to inspire researchers to explore new horizons and fully unleash the potential of FAS.</description>

      <title>Inferring directed spectral information flow between mixed-frequency time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying directed spectral information flow between multivariate time series is important for many applications in finance, climate, geophysics and neuroscience. Spectral Granger causality (SGC) is a prediction-based measure characterizing directed information flow at specific oscillatory frequencies. However, traditional vector autoregressive (VAR) approaches are insufficient to assess SGC when time series have mixed frequencies (MF) or are coupled by nonlinearity. Here we propose a time-frequency canonical correlation analysis approach ("MF-TFCCA") to assess the strength and driving frequency of spectral information flow. We validate the approach with extensive computer simulations on MF time series under various interaction conditions and further assess statistical significance of the estimate with surrogate data. In various benchmark comparisons, MF-TFCCA consistently outperforms the traditional parametric MF-VAR model in both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and recovers the dominant driving frequencies. We further apply MF-TFCCA to real-life finance, climate and neuroscience data. Our analysis framework provides an exploratory and computationally efficient nonparametric approach to quantify directed information flow between MF time series in the presence of complex and nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for Movable Antenna Enhanced Multiuser Covert Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to employ movable antenna (MA) to enhance covert communications with noise uncertainty, where the confidential data is transmitted from an MA-aided access point (AP) to multiple users with a warden attempting to detect the existence of the legal transmission. To maximize the sum rate of users under covertness constraint, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the transmit beamforming and the positions of MAs at the AP. To solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we develop a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) based algorithm, where the proximal distance algorithm (PDA) and the successive convex approximation (SCA) are employed to optimize the transmit beamforming and the MAs' positions, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed MAs-aided system can significantly increase the covert sum rate via antenna position optimization as compared to conventional systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs).</description>

Abstract: With the advancements in graph neural network, there has been increasing interest in applying this network to ECG signal analysis. In this study, we generated an adjacency matrix using correlation matrix of extracted features and applied a graph neural network to classify arrhythmias.

      <title>AE-DENet: Enhancement for Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated remarkable achievements in addressing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel estimation challenges. However, existing DL-based methods mainly rely on separate real and imaginary inputs while ignoring the inherent correlation between the two streams, such as amplitude and phase information that are fundamental in communication signal processing. This paper proposes AE-DENet, a novel autoencoder(AE)-based data enhancement network to improve the performance of existing DL-based channel estimation methods. AE-DENet focuses on enriching the classic least square (LS) estimation input commonly used in DL-based methods by employing a learning-based data enhancement method, which extracts interaction features from the real and imaginary components and fuses them with the original real/imaginary streams to generate an enhanced input for better channel inference. Experimental findings in terms of the mean square error (MSE) results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of all state-of-the-art DL-based channel estimators with negligible added complexity. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown to be robust to channel variations and high user mobility.</description>

      <title>DoF Analysis and Beamforming Design for Active IRS-aided Multi-user MIMO Wireless Communication in Rank-deficient Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to its ability of significantly improving data rate, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) will be a potential crucial technique for the future generation wireless networks like 6G. In this paper, we will focus on the analysis of degree of freedom (DoF) in IRS-aided multi-user MIMO network. Firstly, the DoF upper bound of IRS-aided single-user MIMO network, i.e., the achievable maximum DoF of such a system, is derived, and the corresponding results are extended to the case of IRS-aided multiuser MIMO by using the matrix rank inequalities. In particular, in serious rank-deficient, also called low-rank, channels like line-of-sight (LoS), the network DoF may doubles over no-IRS with the help of IRS. To verify the rate performance gain from augmented DoF, three closed-form beamforming methods, null-space projection plus maximize transmit power and maximize receive power (NSP-MTP-MRP), Schmidt orthogonalization plus minimum mean square error (SO-MMSE) and two-layer leakage plus MMSE (TLL-MMSE) are proposed to achieve the maximum DoF. Simulation results shows that IRS does make a dramatic rate enhancement. For example, in a serious deficient channel, the sum-rate of the proposed TLL-MMSE aided by IRS is about twice that of no IRS. This means that IRS may achieve a significant DoF improvement in such a channel.</description>

      <title>SPDIM: Source-Free Unsupervised Conditional and Label Shift Adaptation in EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) introduces distribution shifts across domains (e.g., days and subjects), posing a significant challenge to EEG-based neurotechnology generalization. Without labeled calibration data for target domains, the problem is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) problem. For scenarios with constant label distribution, Riemannian geometry-aware statistical alignment frameworks on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold are considered state-of-the-art. However, many practical scenarios, including EEG-based sleep staging, exhibit label shifts. Here, we propose a geometric deep learning framework for SFUDA problems under specific distribution shifts, including label shifts. We introduce a novel, realistic generative model and show that prior Riemannian statistical alignment methods on the SPD manifold can compensate for specific marginal and conditional distribution shifts but hurt generalization under label shifts. As a remedy, we propose a parameter-efficient manifold optimization strategy termed SPDIM. SPDIM uses the information maximization principle to learn a single SPD-manifold-constrained parameter per target domain. In simulations, we demonstrate that SPDIM can compensate for the shifts under our generative model. Moreover, using public EEG-based brain-computer interface and sleep staging datasets, we show that SPDIM outperforms prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Valued Signal Estimation via Low-Complexity Message Passing Algorithm for Highly Correlated Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a discrete-valued signal estimation scheme based on a low-complexity Bayesian optimal message passing algorithm (MPA) for solving massive linear inverse problems under highly correlated measurements. Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) can be derived by applying the central limit theorem (CLT)-based Gaussian approximation to the sum-product algorithm (SPA) operating on a dense factor graph (FG), while matched filter (MF)-expectation propagation (EP) can be obtained based on the EP framework tailored for the same FG. Generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) can be found by applying a rigorous approximation technique for both of them in the large-system limit, and these three MPAs perform signal detection using MF by assuming large-scale uncorrelated observations. However, each of them has a different inherent self-noise suppression mechanism, which makes a significant difference in the robustness against the correlation of the observations when we apply an annealed discrete denoiser (ADD) that adaptively controls its nonlinearity with the inverse temperature parameter corresponding to the number of iterations. In this paper, we unravel the mechanism of this interesting phenomenon, and further demonstrate the practical applicability of the low-complexity Bayesian optimal MPA with ADD under highly correlated measurements.</description>

Abstract: Optimal algorithms are developed for robust detection of changes in non-stationary processes. These are processes in which the distribution of the data after change varies with time. The decision-maker does not have access to precise information on the post-change distribution. It is shown that if the post-change non-stationary family has a distribution that is least favorable in a well-defined sense, then the algorithms designed using the least favorable distributions are robust and optimal. Non-stationary processes are encountered in public health monitoring and space and military applications. The robust algorithms are applied to real and simulated data to show their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Optimal vintage factor analysis with deflation varimax</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vintage factor analysis is one important type of factor analysis that aims to first find a low-dimensional representation of the original data, and then to seek a rotation such that the rotated low-dimensional representation is scientifically meaningful. The most widely used vintage factor analysis is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation. Despite its popularity, little theoretical guarantee can be provided to date mainly because varimax rotation requires to solve a non-convex optimization over the set of orthogonal matrices.
  In this paper, we propose a deflation varimax procedure that solves each row of an orthogonal matrix sequentially. In addition to its net computational gain and flexibility, we are able to fully establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed procedure in a broader context. Adopting this new deflation varimax as the second step after PCA, we further analyze this two step procedure under a general class of factor models. Our results show that it estimates the factor loading matrix in the minimax optimal rate when the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is moderate or large. In the low SNR regime, we offer possible improvement over using PCA and the deflation varimax when the additive noise under the factor model is structured. The modified procedure is shown to be minimax optimal in all SNR regimes. Our theory is valid for finite sample and allows the number of the latent factors to grow with the sample size as well as the ambient dimension to grow with, or even exceed, the sample size. Extensive simulation and real data analysis further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given parasitic direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. However, this first study did not include any experimental exploration to verify the theoretical results. To complete this study, this work presents an experimental validation of the proposed design, with a focus on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the considered parasitic direction. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

Abstract: Directly parameterizing and learning gradients of functions has widespread significance, with specific applications in inverse problems, generative modeling, and optimal transport. This paper introduces gradient networks (GradNets): novel neural network architectures that parameterize gradients of various function classes. GradNets exhibit specialized architectural constraints that ensure correspondence to gradient functions. We provide a comprehensive GradNet design framework that includes methods for transforming GradNets into monotone gradient networks (mGradNets), which are guaranteed to represent gradients of convex functions. Our results establish that our proposed GradNet (and mGradNet) universally approximate the gradients of (convex) functions. Furthermore, these networks can be customized to correspond to specific spaces of potential functions, including transformed sums of (convex) ridge functions. Our analysis leads to two distinct GradNet architectures, GradNet-C and GradNet-M, and we describe the corresponding monotone versions, mGradNet-C and mGradNet-M. Our empirical results demonstrate that these architectures provide efficient parameterizations and outperform existing methods by up to 15 dB in gradient field tasks and by up to 11 dB in Hamiltonian dynamics learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Destructive and constructive RIS beamforming in an ISAC-multi-user MIMO network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has already established itself as a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem, even more so when paired with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as RISs can shape the propagation environment by adjusting their phase-shift coefficients. Albeit the potential performance gain, a RIS is also a potential security threat to the system. In this paper, we explore both the positive and negative sides of having a RIS in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC network. We first develop an alternating optimization algorithm, obtaining the active and passive beamforming vectors that maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for the communication users and finite power budget. We also investigate the destructive potential of the RIS by devising a RIS phase-shift optimization algorithm that minimizes the sensing SNR while preserving the same minimum communication SINR previously guaranteed by the system. We further investigate the impact of the RIS's individual element failures on the system performance. The simulation results show that the RIS performance-boosting potential is as good as its destructive one and that both of our optimization strategies are hindered by the investigated impairments.</description>

Abstract: Microfarming and urban computing have evolved as two distinct sustainability pillars of urban living today. In this paper, we combine these two concepts, while majorly extending them jointly towards novel concepts of smart microfarming and urban computing continuum. Smart microfarming is proposed with applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in microfarming, while an urban computing continuum is proposed as a major extension of the concept towards an efficient Internet of Things (IoT) -edge-cloud continuum. We propose and build a system architecture for a plant recommendation system that uses machine learning (ML) at the edge to find, from a pool of given plants, the most suitable ones for a given microfarm using monitored soil values obtained from IoT sensor devices. Moreover, we propose to integrate long-distance LongRange (LoRa) communication solution for sending the data from IoT to the edge system, due to its unlicensed nature and potential for open source implementations. Finally, we propose to integrate open source and less constrained application protocol solutions, such as Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) protocols, for storing the data in the cloud. An experimental setup is used to evaluate and analyze the performance and reliability of the data collection procedure and the quality of the recommendation solution. Furthermore, collaborative filtering is used for the completion of an incomplete information about soils and plants. Finally, various ML algorithms are applied to identify and recommend the optimal plan for a specific microfarm in an urban area.</description>
