      <title>High-Winding-Number Zero-Energy Edge States in Rhombohedral-Stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of rhombohedral-stacked N-layer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger networks with interlayer coupling. We find that these systems exhibit $2N$-fold degenerate zero-energy edge states with winding number $W=N$, providing a direct route to high-winding-number topological phases where $W$ equals the layer number. Using effective Hamiltonian theory and Zak phase calculations, we demonstrate that the winding number scales linearly with $N$ through a layer-by-layer topological amplification mechanism. We introduce the Wigner entropy as a novel detection method for these edge states, showing that topological boundary states exhibit significantly enhanced Wigner entropy compared to bulk states. Our results establish rhombohedral stacking as a systematic approach for engineering high-winding-number topological insulators with potential applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model revealed by neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether the ground state of the square lattice Hubbard model exhibits superconductivity re- mains a major open question, central to understanding high temperature cuprate superconductors and ultra-cold fermions in optical lattices. Numerical studies have found evidence for stripe-ordered states and superconductivity at strong coupling but the phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we show that one can resolve the subtle energetics of metallic, superconducting, and stripe phases using a new class of neural quantum state (NQS) wavefunctions that extend hidden fermion de- terminant states to Pfaffians. We simulate several hundred electrons using fast Pfaffian algorithms allowing us to measure off-diagonal long range order. At strong coupling and low hole-doping, we find that a non-superconducting filled stripe phase prevails, while superconductivity coexisting with partially-filled stripes is stabilized by a negative next neighbor hopping t-prime, with |t-prime| &gt; 0.1. At larger doping levels, we introduce momentum-space correlation functions to mitigate finite size effects that arise from weakly-bound pairs. These provide evidence for uniform d-wave superconductivity at U = 4, even when t-prime = 0. Our results highlight the potential of NQS approaches, and provide a fresh perspective on superconductivity in the square lattice Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>The geometry of jamming algorithms in the random Lorentz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic optimization algorithms unequivocally partition a complex energy landscape in inherent structures (ISs) and their respective basins of attraction. Can these basins be defined solely through geometric principles? This question is paramount to understanding hard sphere jamming, a key model of disordered matter. We here address the issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent-like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting ISs is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs, which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class. Along the way, the physical origin of a dynamical Gardner transition is identified.</description>

      <title>Two-Point Deterministic Equivalence for Stochastic Gradient Dynamics in Linear Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a novel deterministic equivalence for the two-point function of a random matrix resolvent. Using this result, we give a unified derivation of the performance of a wide variety of high-dimensional linear models trained with stochastic gradient descent. This includes high-dimensional linear regression, kernel regression, and linear random feature models. Our results include previously known asymptotics as well as novel ones.</description>

      <title>Optical and transport properties of NbN thin films revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Topology of Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.</description>

      <title>Universal Frequency Correlations and Recurrence Statistics of Complex Impedance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear electromagnetic wave scattering systems can be characterized by an impedance matrix that relates the voltages and currents at the ports of the system. When the system size becomes greater than the wavelength of the fields involved, the impedance matrix becomes a complicated function of the details of the system, in which case a statistical model, such as the Random Coupling Model (RCM) becomes useful. The statistics of the elements of the RCM impedance matrix depend on the excitation frequency, the spectral density of the modes of the enclosed system volume, the average loss factor (Q^{-1}) of the system, and the properties of the coupling ports as given by their radiation impedances. In this paper, properties of the elements of impedance matrices are explored numerically and experimentally. These include the two point frequency correlation functions for the complex impedance of elements and the expected difference in frequencies between which impedance values are approximately repeated. Universal scaling arguments are then given for these quantities, hence these results are generic for all sufficiently complicated scattering systems, including acoustic and optical systems. The experimental data presented in this paper come from microwave graphs, billiards, and three-dimensional cavities with embedded tunable perturbers such as metasurfaces. The data is found to be in generally good agreement with the predictions for the two point frequency correlations and the frequency interval for successive repetitions of impedance matrix elements values.</description>
