      <title>Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans. In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25 states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance, while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient, language-driven automation in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Open Source Planning &amp; Control System with Language Agents for Autonomous Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning &amp; Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.</description>

      <title>KVFlow: Efficient Prefix Caching for Accelerating LLM-Based Multi-Agent Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agentic workflows have become a popular paradigm for coordinating multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks. To improve serving efficiency, existing LLM systems employ prefix caching to reuse key-value (KV) tensors corresponding to agents' fixed prompts, thereby avoiding redundant computation across repeated invocations. However, current systems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy, which fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches shortly before their reuse. This leads to frequent cache misses and substantial recomputation or swapping overhead. We present KVFlow, a workflow-aware KV cache management framework tailored for agentic workloads. KVFlow abstracts the agent execution schedule as an Agent Step Graph and assigns each agent a steps-to-execution value that estimates its temporal proximity to future activation. These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node level, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently manage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a fully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required tensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next step, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation. Compared to SGLang with hierarchical radix cache, KVFlow achieves up to 1.83$\times$ speedup for single workflows with large prompts, and up to 2.19$\times$ speedup for scenarios with many concurrent workflows.</description>

      <title>Toward Real-World Chinese Psychological Support Dialogues: CPsDD Dataset and a Co-Evolving Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models: Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12 support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv datasets.</description>

      <title>Conjugated Capabilities: Interrelations of Elementary Human Capabilities and Their Implication on Human-Machine Task Allocation and Capability Testing Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human and automation capabilities are the foundation of every human-autonomy interaction and interaction pattern. Therefore, machines need to understand the capacity and performance of human doing, and adapt their own behavior, accordingly. In this work, we address the concept of conjugated capabilities, i.e. capabilities that are dependent or interrelated and between which effort can be distributed. These may be used to overcome human limitations, by shifting effort from a deficient to a conjugated capability with performative resources. For example: A limited arm's reach may be compensated by tilting the torso forward. We analyze the interrelation between elementary capabilities within the IMBA standard to uncover potential conjugation, and show evidence in data of post-rehabilitation patients. From the conjugated capabilities, within the example application of stationary manufacturing, we create a network of interrelations. With this graph, a manifold of potential uses is enabled. We showcase the graph's usage in optimizing IMBA test design to accelerate data recordings, and discuss implications of conjugated capabilities on task allocation between the human and an autonomy.</description>

      <title>MF-LLM: Simulating Population Decision Dynamics via a Mean-Field Large Language Model Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating collective decision-making involves more than aggregating individual behaviors; it emerges from dynamic interactions among individuals. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for social simulation, achieving quantitative alignment with real-world data remains a key challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose the Mean-Field LLM (MF-LLM) framework, the first to incorporate mean field theory into LLM-based social simulation. MF-LLM models bidirectional interactions between individuals and the population through an iterative process, generating population signals to guide individual decisions, which in turn update the signals. This interplay produces coherent trajectories of collective behavior. To improve alignment with real-world data, we introduce IB-Tune, a novel fine-tuning method inspired by the Information Bottleneck principle, which retains population signals most predictive of future actions while filtering redundant history. Evaluated on a real-world social dataset, MF-LLM reduces KL divergence to human population distributions by 47\% compared to non-mean-field baselines, enabling accurate trend forecasting and effective intervention planning. Generalizing across 7 domains and 4 LLM backbones, MF-LLM provides a scalable, high-fidelity foundation for social simulation.</description>

      <title>MAEBE: Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE) framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing, both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.</description>

      <title>HARMONIC: Cognitive and Control Collaboration in Human-Robotic Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes HARMONIC, a cognitive-robotic architecture that integrates the OntoAgent cognitive framework with general-purpose robot control systems applied to human-robot teaming (HRT). HARMONIC incorporates metacognition, meaningful natural language communication, and explainability capabilities required for developing mutual trust in HRT. Through simulation experiments involving a joint search task performed by a heterogeneous team of two HARMONIC-based robots and a human operator, we demonstrate heterogeneous robots that coordinate their actions, adapt to complex scenarios, and engage in natural human-robot communication. Evaluation results show that HARMONIC-based robots can reason about plans, goals, and team member attitudes while providing clear explanations for their decisions, which are essential requirements for realistic human-robot teaming.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Pathfinding Under Team-Connected Communication Constraint via Adaptive Path Expansion and Dynamic Leading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel planning framework to handle a multi-agent pathfinding problem under team-connected communication constraint, where all agents must have a connected communication channel to the rest of the team during their entire movements. Standard multi-agent path finding approaches (e.g., priority-based search) have potential in this domain but fail when neighboring configurations at start and goal differ. Their single-expansion approach -- computing each agent's path from the start to the goal in just a single expansion -- cannot reliably handle planning under communication constraints for agents as their neighbors change during navigating. Similarly, leader-follower approaches (e.g., platooning) are effective at maintaining team communication, but fixing the leader at the outset of planning can cause planning to become stuck in dense-clutter environments, limiting their practical utility. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel two-level multi-agent pathfinding framework that integrates two techniques: adaptive path expansion to expand agent paths to their goals in multiple stages; and dynamic leading technique that enables the reselection of the leading agent during each agent path expansion whenever progress cannot be made. Simulation experiments show the efficiency of our planners, which can handle up to 25 agents across five environment types under a limited communication range constraint and up to 11-12 agents on three environment types under line-of-sight communication constraint, exceeding 90% success-rate where baselines routinely fail.</description>
