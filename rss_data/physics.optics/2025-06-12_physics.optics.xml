      <title>Tracking and controlling monolayer water in gold nanogaps using extreme plasmonic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanogaps are ubiquitous across science, confining molecules and thus changing chemistries which influence many areas such as catalysis, corrosion, photochemistry, and sensing. However in ambient conditions, it is unclear how water solvates nanogaps and even if nominally dry, what water structure persists. Despite its low Raman cross-section, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enables study of water at coinage metal surfaces. Using multi-layer aggregates of close-packed gold nanoparticles with sub-nanometre gaps precisely defined by organic spacer molecules, we achieve consistent and large SERS enhancements, enabling systematic study of water within these confined spaces. Ostensibly dry facets in air evidence water monolayer coatings, with hydrogen-bonding only reappearing upon immersion in solution. Under negative applied potentials, surface water is seen to re-orient at the metal facets with distinct spectral shifts among the quartet of vibrational peaks which correspond to those expected from water dimers. Comparing nanogaps in deuterated water also reveals how individual water molecules bind onto organic spacer molecules in such nanogaps. Realistic models of water dressing will enable better understanding of catalytic and contact chemistries.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Dispersion Surfaces Measurement Unlocks Photonic Crystal Slabs Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of dispersion surfaces (DS) in photonic crystals (PhCs) can predict striking topological features, such as bound states in the continuum (BICs). Precise measurement of dispersion, particularly near the {\Gamma}-point, is crucial since even subtle geometric deviations significantly impact the distribution of topological charges and associated polarization singularities. Here, we propose a novel technique to measure DS of PhC slabs with high angular accuracy of up to 3 x 10^(-4) radians, and spectral accuracy of 0.2 nm within an expanded region of the Brillouin zone. Remarkably, our technique is diffraction- and aberration-free as it does not rely on optical imaging but rather on spectral mapping. The analysis of DS presented in this work demonstrates the robustness of our technique, and enables us to distinguish anisotropic BICs along a specific symmetry axis from isotropic states around the {\Gamma}-point. Moreover, the experimental DS obtained supply the information necessary to study and identify super-BICs.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals waveguide quantum electrodynamics probed by infrared nano-photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically layered van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit remarkable properties, including highly-confined infrared waveguide modes and the capacity for infrared emission in the monolayer limit. Here, we engineered structures that leverage both of these nano-optical functionalities. Specifically, we encased a photoluminescing atomic sheet of MoTe2 within two bulk crystals of WSe2, forming a vdW waveguide for the embedded light-emitting monolayer. The modified electromagnetic environment offered by the WSe2 waveguide alters MoTe2 spontaneous emission, a phenomenon we directly image with our interferometric nano-photoluminescence technique. We captured spatially-oscillating nanoscale patterns prompted by spontaneous emission from MoTe2 into waveguide modes of WSe2 slabs. We quantify the resulting Purcell-enhanced emission rate within the framework of a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) model, relating the MoTe2 spontaneous emission rate to the measured waveguide dispersion. Our work marks a significant advance in the implementation of all-vdW QED waveguides.</description>

      <title>Soliton self-excitation under pulsed driving in a Kerr resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel regime of cavity soliton excitation in a Kerr resonator driven by a train of desynchronised pulses. In this regime, the soliton solution is shown to be the sole available state for the intracavity field, allowing for the automatic excitation of single solitons without the application of any external perturbations or parameter ramping. The self-excitation of cavity soliton frequency combs is validated through numerical continuation of the Lugiato-Lefever equation, direct numerical integration, and experimental observation. We show that this regime of CS self-excitation requires only the cavity detuning and pump desynchronisation parameters to be set within the correct range, thus considerably simplifying the usually complex task of deterministic cavity soliton excitation. Additionally, we show that this procedure can also be extended to allow the deterministic generation of different families of multi-soliton bound-states. We believe this research offers a promising approach to considerably simplify cavity soliton generation in both macro- and micro- scale Kerr resonators, while also offering greatly increased thermal, power, and nonlinear efficiencies intrinsic to pulsed-driven systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient nanophotonic devices optimization using deep neural network trained with physics-based transfer learning (PBTL) methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural network(NN)-based surrogate modeling framework for photonic device optimization, especially in domains with imbalanced feature importance and high data generation costs. Our framework, which comprises physics-based transfer learning (PBTL)-enhanced surrogate modeling and scalarized multi-objective genetic algorithms (GAs), offers a generalizable solution for photonic design automation with minimal data resources.To validate the framework, we optimize mid-infrared quantum cascade laser (QCL) structures consisting of two regions, active and injection, which have different levels of feature importance. The optimization targets include five key QCL performance metrics such as modal gain, emission wavelength, linewidth, and effective injection, extraction energies. To address the challenge of multiple local optima in the output latent space, we integrate a deep neural network total predictor (DNN-TP) with a GA, enabling scalable and nature-inspired optimization. By replacing computationally expensive numerical simulations with the DNN-TP surrogate model, the optimization achieves a speed-up of over 80,000 times, allowing large-scale exploration of the QCL design space.To improve model generalization with limited data, we introduce PBTL, which transfers knowledge from a DNN core predictor (DNN-CP) trained on active-region structures. This approach yields a 0.69 percentage increase in prediction accuracy, equivalent to a 50 percentage reduction in training data requirements, and leads to generate more feasible device structure with 60 percentage improvement in evaluation metric during optimization.</description>

      <title>Broadband Tunable Deep-UV Emission from AI-Optimized Nonlinear Metasurface Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces represent a pivotal advancement in nonlinear optics, leveraging high-Q resonant cavities to enhance harmonic generation. Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLMs) further amplify this potential by intensifying light-matter interactions within individual meta-atoms at the nanoscale. However, maximizing nonlinear efficiency demands extreme field confinement through optimized designs of large geometric and material parameters, which exceed traditional simulation's computational ability. To overcome this, we introduce NanoPhotoNet-NL, an AI-driven design tool employing a hybrid deep neural network (DNN) that synergizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. This framework accelerates nonlinear MLM design speed by four orders of magnitude while maintaining over 98.3% prediction accuracy relative to physical simulators. The optimized MLMs achieve quality factors exceeding 50, enabling broadband third-harmonic generation (THG) in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) from wavelengths 200 nm to 260 nm via parametric sweeps. Furthermore, NanoPhotoNet-NL facilitates dynamically tunable DUV nanolight sources with 20 nm spectral coverage in the UVC band using low-loss nonlinear phase change materials. This work marks a transformative leap in nonlinear metasurface engineering, unlocking high-performance, reconfigurable platforms for nonlinear and quantum optical nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit bi-colour modulation and analysis of structured light in a nonlinear optics experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we propose the use of an adjustable liquid crystal spin-orbit device to shape and detect bi-colour structured light in a nonlinear optics framework. The spin-orbit device has an inhomogeneous optical axis orientation and birefringence, allowing it to modulate two wavelengths of light with pre-selected transmission functions by simply tuning a voltage. We combine this bi-colour functionality in a nonlinear optical experiment by employing three-wave mixing in a periodically poled crystal to show how the combined effect of linear spin-orbit transformation rules and nonlinear selection rules gives rise to novel approaches for light to modulate light, and light to unravel light. We show that the roles of the nonlinear crystal and spin-orbit device can be switched to either characterise the device with known light, or unravel unknown light with the device. This synergy between spin-orbit and nonlinear optics offers a novel paradigm where light manipulates and reveals its own structure across spectral domains.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Acoustic Event Monitoring in Single-Mode Fibers Using Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization optical fiber sensors are based on modifications of fiber birefringence by an external measurand (e.g. strain, pressure, acoustic waves). Yet, this means that different input states of polarization will result in very distinct behaviors, which may or may not be optimal in terms of sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. To tackle this challenge, this manuscript presents an optimization technique for the input polarization state using the Fisher information formalism, which allows for achieving maximal precision for a statistically unbiased metric. By first measuring the variation of the Mueller matrix of the optical fiber in response to controlled acoustic perturbations induced by piezo speakers, we compute the corresponding Fisher information operator. Using maximal information states of the Fisher information, it was possible to observe a significant improvement in the performance of the sensor, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio from 4.3 to 37.6 dB, attaining an almost flat response from 1.5 kHz up to 15 kHz. As a proof-of-concept for dynamic audio signal detection, a broadband acoustic signal was also reconstructed with significant gain, demonstrating the usefulness of the introduced formalism for high-precision sensing with polarimetric fiber sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared spectral region holds growing importance for applications such as gas sensing and spectroscopy. Although compact ultrashort pulse laser sources are essential to enable these applications, their realization in this spectral range remains an open challenge. We demonstrate an integrated approach to generate pulses in the mid-infrared based on chirped Bragg gratings engineered to compensate for the group delay dispersion of quantum cascade laser frequency comb sources. SiGe graded-index photonic circuits are used for operation around 8 {\mu}m wavelength. With this approach, pulses as short as 1.39 picoseconds were obtained, marking a key step towards fully integrated ultrashort pulse sources in the mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Tunable Membrane Metasurfaces for Infrared Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectroscopy enables biochemical sensing by identifying vibrational molecular fingerprints, but it faces limitations in instrumentation portability and analytical sensitivity. Optical metasurfaces with strong mid-IR photonic resonances provide an attractive solution towards on-chip spectrometry and sensitive molecular detection, yet their static nature hinders their anticipated impact. Here, we introduce and demonstrate dynamically tunable silicon membrane metasurfaces exhibiting high-Q transmissive resonances in the fingerprint region. By harnessing silicon's thermo-optical properties, we achieve continuous modulation of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-like modes that emerge upon the interference of quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) and surface lattice modes. We measure a spectral tuning rate of 0.06 $cm^{-1}/K$ by continuously sweeping the sharp EIT resonances over a 23.5 $cm^{-1}$ spectral range across a temperature range of 300-700 K. This dynamic transmission control enables non-contact chemical analysis of polymer films by detecting characteristic absorption bands of polystyrene (1450 and 1492 $cm^{-1}$) and Poly(methyl methacrylate) (1730 $cm^{-1}$) without bulky spectrometers. When analyte molecules fill the metasurface-generated photonic cavities, we demonstrate vibrational strong coupling between the Poly(methyl methacrylate)'s carbonyl band and the EIT mode, manifested in the Rabi splitting of $\sim$ 43 $cm^{-1}$. Our results establish a new photonic platform that unites spectral precision, strong field enhancement, and reconfigurability, offering diverse potential for compact mid-IR spectroscopy, molecular sensing, and programmable polaritonic photonics.</description>

      <title>Laser Stabilised Ionising Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a ionising electronic transition under resonant pumping. We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission and Purcell effect: some aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter, part of the Proceedings of the III International Workshop on Quantum Nonstationary Systems (eds. Alexandre Dodonov and Lucas Chibebe Celeri), held in Brasilia in August 2024, offers a comprehensive overview of spontaneous emission (SE) and the Purcell effect within the broader context of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and vacuum fluctuations. It begins with a historical and theoretical review, tracing the development of classical and quantum electromagnetic theories. The chapter then examines how the SE rate of a quantum emitter is fundamentally influenced by its electromagnetic environment, the so-called Purcell effect, through canonical examples, such as emitters near perfectly conducting plates and inside cavities, as well as more advanced scenarios. Special attention is given to modern strategies for tailoring SE using engineered environments, including plasmonic cloaks, composite media near percolation thresholds, metal-insulator phase transitions, and strain-induced modulation in phosphorene. Analytical techniques, such as mode summation and Green's function formalism, are employed to describe how surrounding materials and boundary conditions affect local field modes and the local density of states. The findings underscore both the theoretical depth and experimental relevance of SE modulation, paving the way for innovations in nano-optics, quantum technologies, and advanced material design.</description>

      <title>Studying all-optical magnetization switching of GdFe by double-pulse laser excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tremendous interest in the technology and underlying physics of all-optical switching of magnetization brings up the question of how fast the switching can occur and how high the frequency of writing the data with ultrafast laser pulses can be. To answer this question, we excited a GdFe ferrimagnetic alloy, the magnetization of which can be reversed by single laser pulses, a phenomenon known as toggle switching, by two pulses with a certain time delay in between. Using photoemission electron microscopy and Kerr microscopy for magnetic domain imaging, we explore the effects of varying fluences of the first and second pulse as well as the time delay between the two pulses. Our results show that when the fluence of the first pulse is adjusted just above the threshold of single-pulse switching, a second pulse with about 60% of the fluence of the first pulse, arriving only 3 ps later, switches the magnetization back. This reswitching persists up to about 40 ps pulse separation. We interpret the latter as the time required for the sample to cool down and remagnetize after the first pulse. For shorter time delays below about 2 ps, no re-switching occurs. However, the effect of the two pulses adds up, enabling switching for fluences of both pulses below the threshold for single-pulse switching. Atomistic spin dynamics simulations are used to model the experimental data, successfully confirming our results.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Electronic and Ionic Nonlinear Polarization Effects in the THz Kerr Response of LaAlO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear responses to intense terahertz (THz) fields provide unique insights into complex dynamics of contemporary material systems. However, the interpretation of the obtained data, in particular, distinguishing genuine ionic oscillations from the instantaneous electronic responses in THz Kerr effect remains challenging. Here, we combine two-dimensional Terahertz Kerr effect (2D-TKE) spectroscopy experiments and their modeling to unravel complex THz-induced temporal oscillations in twinned LaAlO$_3$ crystals at low temperatures. We identify the 1.1 THz mode as $E_g$ Raman phonon, while 0.86 THz and 0.36 THz signals are due to spurious effects resulting from the co- and counter-propagation of THz and optical probe pulses in birefringent twin domains. Furthermore, we determine that the $E_g$ mode is excited via a two-photon process, whereas THz pulse reflections at the sample surface produce a temporal response that can mimic anharmonic phonon coupling. Our findings highlight the importance of propagation effects in nonlinear THz experiments and provide a refined framework for interpreting THz polarization dynamics in birefringent crystals.</description>

      <title>Time-domain field correlation measurements enable tomography of highly multimode quantum states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in ultrafast optics facilitates the investigation of the dynamics of highly multimode quantum states of light, as demonstrated by the application of electro-optic sampling to quantum states of the electromagnetic field. Yet, the complete tomographic reconstruction of optical quantum states with prior unknown statistics and dynamics is still challenging, since state-of-the-art tomographic methods require the measurement of many orthogonal, distinguishable modes. Here, we propose a tomography scheme based on time-domain quadrature correlation measurements and theoretically demonstrate its ability to reconstruct highly multimode Gaussian states. In contrast to (eight-port) homodyne detection, the two local oscillator pulses are shorter in time and are (independently) time-delayed against the pulsed quantum state. The distinguishable mode structure is obtained in post-processing from the correlation measurement data by orthogonalization. We show that the number of reconstructable modes increases with the number of time delays used and decreases with the temporal extent of the local oscillator. We extend and optimise our proposed correlation measurement to electro-optic sampling by adding a nonlinear crystal prior to the homodyne detection, potentially achieving subcycle resolution in the mid-infrared to THz regime. By analysing the (quantum) correlations present in the measurement data, we show how thermalisation of the quantum state during detection leads to the requirement of correlation measurements. The thermalisation is especially pronounced in the strong squeezing limit, for which we developed a non-perturbative theory. Furthermore, we open an avenue to extending our tomography scheme to non-Gaussian states by theoretically establishing the complete measurement statistics and showing how to obtain spectral information about pulsed Fock states from the joint statistics.</description>

      <title>Photonic chiral bulk transports manipulated by boundary freedom in three-dimensional meta-crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In topological physics, one of the most intriguing phenomena is the presence of topological boundary states, accurately predicted by the well-established bulk-edge correspondence. For example, in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals, Fermi arcs emerge to connect projected Weyl points on the surface due to inheriting the bulk-edge correspondence from the integer quantum Hall effect. However, limited attention has been paid to exploring the reverse mechanism in topological crystals. In this study, we propose that boundaries can serve as an alternative degree of freedom to manipulate topological bulk transports. We analytically and experimentally validate our concept using a finite-thickness photonic meta-crystal that supports bulk nodal lines, with its zeroth modes exhibiting opposite chiral bulk transports under different boundary conditions. Notably, the mirror symmetry remains preserved across both configurations. These findings are applicable to other topological systems, providing new insights into systems with varied boundary conditions and offering the potential for the design of more compact and spatially efficient topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>A cavity array microscope for parallel single-atom interfacing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Scattering near-field optical microscopy at 1-nm resolution using ultralow tip oscillation amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) allows for the observation of the optical response of material surfaces with a resolution far below the diffraction limit. Based on amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy (AFM) with typical tapping amplitudes of tens of nanometers, a spatial resolution of 10-100 nm is routinely achieved in s-SNOM. However, optical imaging and spectroscopy of atomic-scale structures remain a substantial challenge. Here, we developed ultralow tip oscillation amplitude s-SNOM (ULA-SNOM), where the ultra-confined field localized at a 1-nm-scale gap between a plasmonic tip and sample is combined with frequency-modulation (non-contact) AFM in a stable cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum environment. Using a silver tip under visible laser illumination with a constant 1-nm amplitude oscillation, we obtain a material-contrast image of silicon islands on a silver surface with 1-nm lateral resolution, which surpasses the conventional limits of s-SNOM. ULA-SNOM paves the way for the acquisition of optical information from atomic-scale structures, such as single photo-active defects and molecules.</description>

      <title>Shape and Size-Dependent Surface Plasmonic Resonances of Liquid Metal Alloy (EGaIn) Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid metals (LM) are emerging plasmonic nanomaterials with transformable surface plasmon resonances (SPR) due to their liquid-like deformability. This study delves into the plasmonic properties of LM nanoparticles, with a focus on EGaIn (eutectic gallium-indium)-based materials. Leveraging Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations and experimental validations for spherical liquid metal nanoparticles plasmonic properties, we explored the localized SPR (LSPR) effects of EGaIn nanoparticles with various shapes, including nanospheres, dimers, nanorods, nanodisks, nanoellipses, nanocubes, and nanocuboids, in the broad range of ultraviolet (UV)-visible-near infrared (NIR) spectrum. While EGaIn is conventionally known as a UV-active metal alloy, this study reveals unique LSPR features of EGaIn (e.g., higher order resonances, polar and quadrupolar modes) in the broader visible and NIR wavelength ranges, providing a comprehensive map of LSPR properties for different shapes of EGaIn nanoparticles. These findings offer new insights into the dependence of the optical properties of EGaIn nanoparticles on their geometries for diverse applications, ranging from biosensing, nanoelectronics, to optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gouy Rotation of Electron Vortex beams in uniform magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic rotation of electron vortex beams, governed by their phase structure, has been experimentally observed in magnetic fields by breaking the beam's cylindrical symmetry. However, conventional Landau states, which predict three fixed angular frequencies, cannot fully account for the existing experimental observations. To address this limitation, we introduce and derive the generalized Gouy rotation angle, which links the Gouy phase of an extended Landau state -- featuring a periodically oscillating beam width -- to the experimentally observed angular variation. In particular, this framework predicts a broader spectrum of angular frequencies and captures the reversal of rotation direction observed in electron vortex beams with negative topological charge. Calculations based on experimental parameters show good agreement with previously published data and are further validated here by numerical simulations using the Chebyshev method. Our results are, in principle, applicable to any system involving electron vortex beams in uniform magnetic fields, and provide a foundation for exploring vortex electrons in Glaser and other nonuniform magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Einstein's analogy: black holes as gradient-index lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to Albert Einstein, gravitation is analogous to an optical medium. Building on this idea, various definitions of the gradient-index (GRIN) medium representing curved spacetime have been proposed; often, these approaches demand advanced knowledge of General Relativity (GR) and its associated mathematical methods. This paper introduces an alternative approach for generating the form of GRIN media that reproduces the exact behavior of photon trajectories in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole or about the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole. Our approach is based on Noether's theorem that leads to the optical Fermat principle, leveraging the system's symmetry, resulting in an unrestricted and robust method for finding GRIN media in a flat spacetime that reproduces the behavior of null geodesics in Schwarzschild-like spacetimes, employing only photon trajectories as input. This approach is also valid for massive particles and provides a complementary understanding of GR. For this reason, the method is applied to generate the GRIN medium from the S2 star's trajectory around SgrA*, demonstrating that sufficient precision can be achieved to reproduce the orbit's subtle apsidal precession.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of squeezed states via enhanced bosonic encoding in a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fully digital approach for simulating single-mode squeezed states on a superconducting quantum processor using an enhanced bosonic encoding strategy. By mapping up to 2^{n} photonic Fock states onto n qubits, our framework leverages Gray-code-based encodings to reduce gate overhead compared to conventional one-hot or binary mappings. We further optimize resource usage by restricting the simulation on Fock states with even number of photons only, effectively doubling the range of photon numbers that can be represented for a given number of qubits. To overcome noise and finite coherence in current hardware, we employ a variational quantum simulation protocol, which adapts shallow, parameterized circuits through iterative optimization. Implemented on the Zuchongzhi-2 superconducting platform, our method demonstrates squeezed-state dynamics across a parameter sweep from vacuum state preparation (r=0) to squeezing levels exceeding the Fock space truncation limit (r&gt;1.63). Experimental results, corroborated by quantum state tomography and Wigner-function analysis, confirm high-fidelity state preparation and demonstrate the potential of Gray-code-inspired techniques for realizing continuous-variable physics on near-term, qubit-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Wave pulses with unusual asymptotical behavior at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of wave signals in the far zone is not only of theoretical interest but also of paramount practical importance in communications and other fields of applications of optical, electromagnetic or acoustic waves. Long time ago T. T. Wu introduced models of 'electromagnetic missiles' whose decay could be made arbitrarily slower than the usual inverse distance by an appropriate choice of the high frequency portion of the source spectrum. Very recent work by Plachenov and Kiselev introduced a finite-energy scalar wave solution, different from Wu's, decaying slower than inversely proportional with the distance. A physical explanation for the unusual asymptotic behavior of the latter will be given in this article. Furthermore, two additional examples of scalar wave pulses characterized by abnormal slow decay in the far zone will be given and their asymptotic behavior will be discussed. A proof of feasibility of acoustic and electromagnetic fields with the abnormal asymptotics will be described.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a twisted electron wave packet perturbed by an inhomogeneous electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) wave packets, known for their vortex structure and nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), are of great interest in various scientific fields. Here we study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a spatially-localized electron LG wave packet interacting with an inhomogeneous external electric field that violates the axial symmetry of the initial wave function. We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its qualitative form. We demonstrate that due to the interaction with the external field, the degenerate zeros of the initial wave function located on the $z$ axis split into multiple nondegenerate nodes in the transverse plane representing separate single-charge vortices. This mechanism resembles the analogous effects known in topological optics. These findings provide new insights into controlling and manipulating twisted matter beams and into their possible instabilities.</description>
