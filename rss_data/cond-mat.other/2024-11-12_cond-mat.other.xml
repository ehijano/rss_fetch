      <title>Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect (THE) is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work suggests new avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.</description>

      <title>Chiral quantum optics: recent developments, and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral quantum optics is a growing field of research where light-matter interactions become asymmetrically dependent on momentum and spin, offering novel control over photonic and electronic degrees of freedom. Recently, the platforms for investigating chiral light-matter interactions have expanded from laser-cooled atoms and quantum dots to various solid-state systems, such as microcavity polaritons and two-dimensional layered materials, integrated into photonic structures like waveguides, cavities, and ring resonators. In this perspective, we begin by establishing the foundation for understanding and engineering these chiral light-matter regimes. We review the cutting-edge platforms that have enabled their successful realization in recent years, focusing on solid-state platforms, and discuss the most relevant experimental challenges to fully harness their potential. Finally, we explore the vast opportunities these chiral light-matter interfaces present, particularly their ability to reveal exotic quantum many-body phenomena, such as chiral many-body superradiance and fractional quantum Hall physics.</description>

      <title>Spin-deformation coupling in two-dimensional polar materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of the spin degree of freedom is at the heart of spintronics, which can potentially be achieved by spin-orbit coupling or band topological effects. In this paper, we explore another potential controlled mechanism under debate: the spin-deformation coupling (SDC) - the coupling between intrinsic or extrinsic geometrical deformations and the spin degree of freedom. We focus on polar-deformed thin films or two-dimensional compounds, where the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is considered as an $SU(2)$ non-Abelian gauge field. We demonstrate that the dynamics between surface and normal electronic degrees of freedom can be properly decoupled using the thin-layer approach by performing a suitable gauge transformation, as introduced in the context of many-body correlated systems. Our work leads to three significant results: (i) gauge invariance implies that the spin is uncoupled from the surface's extrinsic geometry, challenging the common consensus; (ii) the Rashba SOC on a curved surface can be included as an $SU(2)$ non-Abelian gauge field in curvilinear coordinates; and (iii) we identify a previously unnoticed scalar geometrical potential dependent on the Rashba SOC strength. This scalar potential, independent of spin, represents the residual effect remaining after decoupling the normal component of the non-Abelian gauge field. The outcomes of our work open novel pathways for exploring the manipulation of spin degrees of freedom through the use of the SDC.</description>

      <title>Formation of Iron-Helium Compounds under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the formations of fcc and distorted hcp iron-helium compounds with x in FeHex up to 0.13 and 0.48, respectively, based on experiments at 5-54 GPa and ~1000-2820 K. Upon releasing pressure under room temperature, these fcc and distorted hcp FeHex were still observed by XRD and SIMS measurements. Our first-principles calculations indicate that fcc and hcp FeHex, with helium atoms occupying the tetrahedral and trigonal-planar interstitial sites (instead of the octahedral sites), are dynamically stable throughout 0-50 GPa. These results support that the Earth's core can be a large reservoir of primordial 3He.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>
