      <title>Quick recipes for gravitational-wave selection effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of selection effects is a key ingredient to the success of gravitational-wave astronomy. The detection probability plays a crucial role in both statistical population studies, where it enters the hierarchical Bayesian likelihood, and astrophysical modeling, where it is used to convert predictions from population-synthesis codes into observable distributions. We review the most commonly used approximations, extend them, and present some recipes for a straightforward implementation. These include a closed-form expression capturing both multiple detectors and noise realizations written in terms of the so-called Marcum Q-function and a ready-to-use mapping between signal-to-noise ratio thresholds and false-alarm rates from state-of-the-art detection pipelines. The bias introduced by approximating the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio with the optimal signal-to-noise ratio is not symmetric: sources that are nominally below threshold are more likely to be detected than sources above threshold are to be missed. Using both analytical considerations and software injections in detection pipelines, we confirm that including noise realizations when estimating the selection function introduces an average variation of a few %. This effect is most relevant for large catalogs and specific subpopulations of sources at the edge of detectability (e.g. high redshifts).</description>

      <title>On the calibration of ultra-high energy EASs at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of calibrations of extensive air showers with zenith angles $\theta \le 50^{\circ}$ and energies $E_{\text{SD}} \le 10^{18.5}$ eV was carried out in experiments at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array. The values of $E_{\text{SD}}$ were determined from particle densities measured with ground-based scintillation detectors at a distance $r = 800$~m from shower axis. Measured densities were compared with the values obtained in simulations preformed with the use of CORSIKA code within the framework of QGSJet-II.04 hadron interaction model for primary protons. For showers with $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ the $E_{\text{SD}}$ estimates of both arrays are very close, and their energy spectra are similar in shape and absolute value. Another Telescope Array calibration, based on measuring the EAS fluorescent radiation with optical detectors, gives underestimated energy $E_{\text{FD}} = 0.787 \times E_{\text{SD}}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the properties of photosphere and emission lines for tidal disruption events based on the global solution of slim disk and winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical debris supply rate from a tidal disruption of stars can exceed about one hundred times of the Eddington accretion rate for a $10^{6-7}M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is believed that a strong wind will be launched from the disk surface due to the radiation pressure in the case of super-Eddington accretion, which may be one of the mechanisms for formation of the envelope as observed in tidal disruption events (TDEs). In this work, we explore the evolution of the envelope that formed from the optical thick winds by solving the global solution of the slim-disk model. Our model can roughly reproduce the typical temperature, luminosity and size of the photosphere for TDEs. Based on \texttt{CLOUDY} modeling, we find that, if only considering the radiation-driven disk wind, the emission line luminosities are normally much lower than the typical observational results due to the limited atmosphere mass outside the envelope. We propose that the ejection of the outflow from the self-collision of the stellar debris during the circularization may provide enough matter outside the disk-wind photosphere. Our calculated spectra can roughly reproduce the main properties of several typical emission lines (e.g., $\rm H\alpha$, $\rm H\beta$ and \ion{He}{2}), which was applied well to a TDE candidate AT2018dyb.</description>

      <title>Discovery of evolving low-frequency QPOs in hard X-rays ($\sim 100$ keV) observed in black hole Swift J1727.8-1613 with $AstroSat$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of evolving Low-Frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillation (LFQPO) frequencies in hard X-rays upto $100$ keV with $AstroSat/LAXPC$ during `unusual' outburst phase of Swift J1727.8-1613 in hard-intermediate state (HIMS). The observed LFQPO in $20 - 100$ keV has a centroid $\nu_{_{\rm QPO}}=1.43$ Hz, a coherence factor $Q= 7.14$ and an amplitude ${\rm rms_{_{\rm QPO}}} = 10.95\%$ with significance $\sigma = 5.46$. Type-C QPOs ($1.09-2.6$ Hz) are found to evolve monotonically during HIMS of the outburst with clear detection in hard X-rays ($80 - 100$ keV), where ${\rm rms_{_{\rm QPO}}}$ decreases ($\sim 12-3\%$) with energy. Further, $\nu_{_{\rm QPO}}$ is seen to correlate (anti-correlate) with low (high) energy flux in $2-20$ keV ($15-50$ keV). Wide-band ($0.7 - 40$ keV) energy spectrum of $NICER/XTI$ and $AstroSat/LAXPC$ is satisfactorily described by the `dominant' thermal Comptonization contribution ($\sim 88\%$) in presence of a `weak' signature of disk emissions ($kT_{\rm in} \sim 0.36$ keV) indicating the harder spectral distribution. Considering source mass $M_{\rm BH}=10M_\odot$ and distance $1.5 &lt; {\rm d~(kpc)} &lt; 5$, the unabsorbed bolometric luminosity is estimated as $\sim 0.03-0.92\%L_{\rm Edd}$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of accretion dynamics around black hole X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Bayesian insights in Tycho supernova remnant : a detailed mapping of ejecta properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Tycho's supernova remnant is one of the most studied type Ia Galactic supernova remnants, a global view of the physical properties of its ejecta is lacking, to understand its mysteries. In particular, the spatial distribution of the Si-rich ejecta line-of-sight velocity presents a large-scale unexplained asymmetry, with the north dominantly blueshifted and the south redshifted. To investigate the origin of this line-of-sight velocity asymmetry in the ejecta, we carry out a detailed X-ray spatially-resolved spectral analysis of the entire shocked ejecta in Tycho's SNR to determine the physical properties of its various components. This study is based on the archival deep X-ray observations from the Chandra space telescope. The spatially-resolved spectral analysis in 211 regions over the entire SNR is based on a tesselation method applied to the line-of-sight velocity map. A Bayesian tool is used to conduct the fitting, using a nested sampling algorithm. It allows us to obtain a complete view of the statistical landscape. We provide maps of the physical parameters of the various components across the SNR ejecta. The Doppler shift map confirms spectrally the large-scale north-south asymmetry in the line-of-sight velocity. We reveal different spatial distributions of temperature and ionization time for IMEs and for iron-rich ejecta, but none of these maps shows structure associated to the large-scale north-south asymmetry in the line-of-sight velocity distribution. The abundance maps show spatial variations, depending on the element, perhaps due to an origin in different layers during the explosion. We compare these abundances with some nucleosynthesis models. In addition, we observe for the first time an emission line at 0.654 keV possibly related to oxygen. Its spatial distribution differs from the other elements, so that this line may arise in the ambient medium.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in dense matter relativistic stars induced by internal sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's field equations with a background source term that induces perturbations and the applications of this new formalism to a compact dense matter relativistic star are presented. We introduce a new response kernel in the field equations between the metric and fluid perturbations. A source term which drives or induces the sub-hydro mesoscopic scales perturbations in the astrophysical system, is of importance here. Deterministic as well as stochastic perturbations for the radial case are worked out as solutions of field equations. We also touch upon polar perturbations that are deterministic with oscillatory parts. The stochastic perturbation are of significance in terms of two point or point separated correlations which form the building blocks for studying equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics for the system. Our main aim is to build a theory for intermediate scale physics, for dense exotic matter and investigate structure of the compact astrophysical objects. Specifically, turbulence which connects various scales in superfluid matter in the dense stars is an area gaining importance. The work presented here is the starting point for new theoretical frame work that touches upon various yet unexplored scales where mechanical and dynamical effects interior to the matter of the star are of significance. Thus there is scope for extending studies in asteroseismology to mesoscopic effects at the new intermediate scales in the cold dense matter fluid . This is expected to enable us to probe astrophysical features at refined scales through theoretical formulations as well as for observational consequences.</description>

      <title>Individual particle approach to the diffusive shock acceleration. Effect of the non-uniform flow velocity downstream of the shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The momentum distribution of particles accelerated at strong non-relativistic shocks may be influenced by the spatial distribution of the flow speed around the shock. This phenomenon becomes evident in the cosmic-ray modified shock, where the particle spectrum itself determines the flow velocity profile upstream. However, what if the flow speed is not uniform downstream as well? Hydrodynamics indicates that its spatial variation over the length scales involved in the acceleration of particles in supernova remnants (SNRs) could be noticeable.} {In the present paper, we address this issue, initially following Bell's approach to particle acceleration and then by solving the kinetic equation. We obtained an analytical solution for the momentum distribution of particles accelerated at the cosmic-ray modified shock with spatially variable flow speed downstream.} {We parameterized the downstream speed profile to illustrate its effect on two model cases, the test particle and non-linear acceleration at the shock.The resulting particle spectrum is generally softer in Sedov SNRs because the flow speed distribution reduces the overall shock compression accessible to particles with higher momenta. On the other hand, the flow structure in young SNRs could lead to harder spectra. The diffusive properties of particles play a crucial role as they determine the distance from the shock, and, as a consequence, the flow speed that particles encounter downstream. We discuss the effect of the plasma velocity gradient to be (partially) responsible for the evolution of the radio index and for the high-energy break visible in gamma rays from some SNRs. We expect that the effect from the gradient of the flow velocity downstream could be prominent in regions of SNRs with higher diffusion coefficient and lower magnetic field, i.e. where acceleration of particles is not very efficient.</description>

      <title>A Very-High-Energy Gamma-Ray View of the Transient Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of the latest generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) over recent decades has led to the discovery of new extreme astrophysical phenomena in the very-high-energy (VHE, E &gt; 100 GeV) gamma-ray regime. Time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy are inevitably connected to the physics of transient VHE emitters, which show unexpected (and mostly unpredictable) flaring or exploding episodes at different timescales. These transients often share the physical processes responsible for the production of the gamma-ray emission, through cosmic-ray acceleration, magnetic reconnection, jet production and/or outflows, and shocks interactions. In this review, we present an up-to-date overview of the VHE transients field, spanning from novae to supernovae, neutrino counterparts or fast radio bursts, among others, and we outline the expectations for future facilities.</description>

      <title>An Online Framework for Fitting Fast Transient Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of extragalactic fast optical transients (eFOTs) as potential multi-messenger sources is one of the main challenges in time-domain astronomy. However, recent developments have allowed for probes of rapidly-evolving transients. With the increasing number of alert streams from optical time-domain surveys, the next paradigm is building technologies to rapidly identify the most interesting transients for follow-up. One effort to make this possible is the fitting of objects to a variety of eFOT lightcurve models such as kilonovae and $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. In this work, we describe a new framework designed to efficiently fit transients to light curve models and flag them for further follow-up. We describe the pipeline's workflow and a handful of performance metrics, including the nominal sampling time for each model. We highlight as examples ZTF20abwysqy, the shortest long gamma ray burst discovered to date, and ZTF21abotose, a core-collapse supernova initially identified as a potential kilonova candidate.</description>

      <title>Probing the Propeller Regime with Symbiotic X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the moment, there are two neutron star X-ray binaries with massive red supergiants as donors. De et al. (2023) proposed that the system SWIFT J0850.8-4219 contains a neutron star at the propeller stage. We study this possibility by applying various models of propeller spin-down. We demonstrate that the duration of the propeller stage is very sensitive to the regime of rotational losses. Only in the case of a relatively slow propeller model proposed by Davies and Pringle (1981), the duration of the propeller is long enough to provide a significant probability to observe the system at this stage. Future determination of the system parameters (orbital and spin periods, magnetic field of the compact object, etc.) will allow putting strong constraints on the propeller behavior.</description>

      <title>IRX-CIGALE: a tailored module for Low-Luminosity AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral energy distribution (SED) of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) presents unique challenges due to their comparable radiation output to their host galaxies and complex accretion dynamics. We introduce a novel module within the CIGALE framework specifically designed for SED fitting of LLAGN, incorporating both empirical relationships like $L_\mathrm{X}$--$L_\mathrm{12\mu m}$ and physically-based accretion models such as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and truncated accretion disks. This allows for more accurate depiction of LLAGN central emissions.
  Using this module, we analyzed a set of 52 X-ray-detected local galaxies, primarily LINERs and Seyferts, and compared its performance to higher-luminosity AGN from the COSMOS and SDSS datasets. Our results show that the module adeptly estimates bolometric luminosities with high precision, despite significant galaxy contamination. It also introduces a versatile X-ray bolometric correction formula covering a vast range of luminosities.
  Further, our study explored the $\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$ index, which measures the UV to X-ray emission slope, showing that unlike quasars, LLAGN display either stable or only slightly varying $\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$ values, indicating differing accretion and photon production processes in the low luminosity regime. Additionally, we observed a significant drop of 1.4 dex in specific star formation rates when moving from whole galaxies to a central 9-arcsecond aperture in LLAGN, suggesting potential feedback mechanisms at play.
  Overall, our findings underscore the importance of a multiwavelength approach in AGN studies, highlighting distinct behaviors of LLAGN compared to quasars, thus enhancing our understanding of LLAGN and providing a framework for future comprehensive AGN population studies.</description>

      <title>Comparing advanced-era interferometric gravitational-wave detector network configurations: sky localization and source properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion and upgrade of the global network of ground-based gravitational wave detectors promises to improve our capacity to infer the sky-localization of transient sources, enabling more effective multi-messenger follow-ups. At the same time, the increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of detected events allows for more precise estimates of the source parameters. This study aims to assess the performance of advanced-era networks of ground-based detectors, focusing on the Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA instruments. We use full Bayesian parameter estimation procedures to predict the scientific potential of a network. Assuming a fixed LIGO configuration, we find that the addition of the Virgo detector is beneficial to the sky localization starting from a binary neutron star horizon distance of 20 Mpc and improves significantly from 40 Mpc onwards for both a single and double LIGO detector network, reducing the inferred mean sky-area by up to 95%. Similarly, the KAGRA detector tightens the constraints, starting from a sensitivity range of 10 Mpc. Looking at highly-spinning binary black holes, we find significant improvements with increasing sensitivity in constraining the intrinsic source parameters when adding Virgo to the two LIGO detectors. Finally, we also examine the impact of the low-frequency cut-off data on the signal-to-noise ratio. We find that existing 20 Hz thresholds are sufficient and propose a metric to monitor this to study detector performance. Our findings quantify how future enhancements in detector sensitivity and network configurations will improve the localization of gravitational wave sources and allow for more precise identification of their intrinsic properties.</description>

      <title>Chandra HETG X-ray Spectra and Variability of $\pi$ Aqr, a $\gamma$ Cas-type Be star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectra of $\pi\,$Aqr, a $\gamma\,$Cas-type star, obtained with the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer, revealed emission lines of H-like ions of Mg, Si, S, and Fe, a strong, hard continuum, and a lack of He-like ions, indicating the presence of very hot thermal plasma. The X-ray light curve showed significant fluctuations, with coherent variability at period of about 3400 seconds in one observation. The hardness ratio was relatively constant except for one observation in which the spectrum was much harder and more absorbed. We interpret the X-ray emission as arising from accretion onto the secondary, which is likely a magnetic white dwarf, an intermediate polar system.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Subtleties in the Scaling of the 'Terminal Momentum' For Galaxy Formation Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In galaxy formation simulations, it is increasingly common to represent supernovae (SNe) at finite resolution (when the Sedov-Taylor phase is unresolved) via hybrid energy-momentum coupling with some 'terminal momentum' $p_{\rm term}$ (depending weakly on ambient density and metallicity) that represents unresolved work from an energy-conserving phase. Numerical implementations can ensure momentum and energy conservation of such methods, but these require that couplings depend on the surrounding gas velocity field (radial velocity $\langle v_{r} \rangle$). This raises the question of whether $p_{\rm term}$ should also be velocity-dependent, which we explore analytically and in simulations. We show that for simple spherical models, the dependence of $p_{\rm term}$ on $\langle v_{r} \rangle$ introduces negligible corrections beyond those already imposed by energy conservation if $\langle v_{r} \rangle \ge 0$. However, for SNe in some net converging flow ($\langle v_{r} \rangle&lt;0$), naively coupling the total momentum when a blastwave reaches the standard cooling/snowplow phase (or some effective cooling time/velocity/temperature criterion) leads to enormous $p_{\rm term}$ and potentially pathological behaviors. We propose an alternative $\Delta$-Momentum formulation which represents the differential SNe effect and show this leads to opposite behavior of $p_{\rm term}$ in this limit. We also consider a more conservative velocity-independent formulation. Testing in numerical simulations, these directly translate to large effects on predicted star formation histories and stellar masses of massive galaxies, explaining differences between some models and motivating further study in idealized simulations.</description>

      <title>A JWST Medium Resolution MIRI Spectrum and Models of the Type Ia supernova 2021aefx at +415 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum (5-27 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021aefx at $+415$ days past $B$-band maximum. The spectrum, which was obtained during the iron-dominated nebular phase, has been analyzed in combination with previous JWST observations of SN 2021aefx, to provide the first JWST time series analysis of an SN Ia. We find the temporal evolution of the [Co III] 11.888 $\mathrm{\mu}$m feature directly traces the decay of $^{56}$Co. The spectra, line profiles, and their evolution are analyzed with off-center delayed-detonation models. Best fits were obtained with White Dwarf (WD) central densities of $\rho_c=0.9-1.1\times 10^9$g cm$^{-3}$, a WD mass of M$_{\mathrm{WD}}$=1.33-1.35M$_\odot$, a WD magnetic field of $\approx10^6$G, and an off-center deflagration-to-detonation transition at $\approx$ 0.5 $M_\odot$ seen opposite to the line of sight of the observer. The inner electron capture core is dominated by energy deposition from $\gamma$-rays whereas a broader region is dominated by positron deposition, placing SN 2021aefx at +415 d in the transitional phase of the evolution to the positron-dominated regime. The formerly `flat-tilted' profile at 9 $\mathrm{\mu}$m now has significant contribution from [Ni IV], [Fe II], and [Fe III] and less from [Ar III], which alters the shape of the feature as positrons excite mostly the low-velocity Ar. Overall, the strength of the stable Ni features in the spectrum is dominated by positron transport rather than the Ni mass. Based on multi-dimensional models, our analysis strongly supports a single-spot, close-to-central ignition with an indication for a pre-existing turbulent velocity field, and excludes a multiple-spot, off-center ignition.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J1010+2358 is not a Pair-Instability Supernova Relic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a star formed out of pair-instability supernova ejecta would have massive implications for the Population III star initial mass function and the existence of stars over 100 Msun, but none have yet been found. Recently, the star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be a star that formed out of gas enriched by a pair-instability supernova. We present a non-LTE abundance analysis of a new high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectrum of J1010+2358. We determined the carbon and aluminum abundances needed to definitively distinguish between enrichment by a pair-instability and core-collapse supernova. Our new analysis demonstrates that J1010+2358 does not have the unique abundance pattern of a a pair-instability supernova, but was instead enriched by the ejecta of a low mass core-collapse supernova. Thus, there are still no known stars displaying unambiguous signatures of pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <title>Cosmology-independent Photon Mass Limits from Localized Fast Radio Bursts by using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hypothetical photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$, can produce a frequency-dependent vacuum dispersion of light, which leads to an additional time delay between photons with different frequencies when they propagate through a fixed distance. The dispersion measure--redshift measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been widely used to constrain the rest mass of the photon. However, all current studies analyzed the effect of the frequency-dependent dispersion for massive photons in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological context. In order to alleviate the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a specific cosmological model based on the fundamental postulate of the masslessness of photons, here we employ a new model-independent smoothing technique, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ function from 34 cosmic-chronometer measurements. By combining observations of 32 well-localized FRBs and the $H(z)$ function reconstructed by ANN, we obtain an upper limit of $m_{\gamma} \le 3.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 2.0 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$ ($m_{\gamma} \le 6.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 3.6 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$) at the $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) confidence level. This is the first cosmology-independent photon mass limit derived from extragalactic sources.</description>

      <title>Bayesian and Principal Component Analyses of Neutron Star Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Bayesian method is used in this extensive work to generate a large set of minimally constrained equations of state (EOSs) for matters in neutron stars (NS). These EOSs are analyzed for their correlations with key NS properties, such as the tidal deformability, radius, and maximum mass, within the mass range of $1.2-2M_\odot$. The observed connections between the pressure of $\beta$-equilibrated matter and the properties of neutron stars at different densities offer significant insights into the behavior of NS matter in a nearly model-independent manner. The study also examines the influence of various factors on the correlation of symmetry energy parameters, such as slope and curvature parameters at saturation density ($\rho_0=0.16 ~\text{fm}^{-3}$) with the tidal deformability and radius of neutron stars. This study investigates the robustness of the observed correlations by considering the distributions and interdependence of symmetry energy parameters. Furthermore, the utilization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to unveil the complicated relationship between various nuclear matter parameters and properties of neutron stars. This analysis highlights the importance of employing multivariate analysis techniques in order to comprehend the variety in tidal deformability and radius observed across distinct masses of NS. This comprehensive study aims to establish a connection between the parameters of nuclear matter and the properties of neutron stars, providing significant insights into the behavior of NS matter across different circumstances.</description>

      <title>Avoiding singularities in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes: the role of atemporality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Schwarzschild metric exhibiting a signature change across the event horizon, which gives rise to what we term a Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole. The resulting geometry is regularized by employing the Hadamard partie finie technique, which allows us to prove that the metric represents a solution of vacuum Einstein equations. In this framework, we introduce the concept of atemporality as the dynamical mechanism responsible for the transition from a regime with a real-valued time variable to a new one featuring an imaginary time. We show that this mechanism prevents the occurrence of the singularity and, by means of the regularized Kretschmann invariant, we discuss in which terms atemporality can be considered as the characteristic feature of this black hole.</description>

      <title>Testing the Origins of Neutrino Mass with Supernova Neutrino Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown. Both the vacuum mass and the dark mass generated by the neutrino interactions with DM particles or fields can fit the current oscillation data. The dark mass squared is proportional to the DM number density and therefore varies on the galactic scale with much larger values around the Galactic Center. This affects the group velocity and the arrival time delay of core-collapse supernovae neutrinos. This time delay, especially for the $\nu_e$ neutronization peak with a sharp time structure, can be used to distinguish the vacuum and dark neutrino masses. For illustration, we explore the potential of DUNE which is sensitive to $\nu_e$. Our simulations show that DUNE can distinguish the two neutrino mass origins at more than $5\sigma\,$C.L., depending on the observed local value of neutrino mass, the neutrino mass ordering, the DM density profile, and the SN location.</description>

      <title>Lens Stochastic Diffraction: A Signature of Compact Structures in Gravitational-Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every signal propagating through the universe is diffracted by the gravitational fields of intervening objects, aka gravitational lenses. Diffraction is most efficient when caused by compact lenses, which invariably produce additional images of a source. The signals associated with additional images are generically faint, but their collective effect may be detectable with coherent sources, such as gravitational waves (GWs), where both amplitude and phase are measured. Here, I describe lens stochastic diffraction (LSD): Poisson-distributed fluctuations after GW events caused by compact lenses. The amplitude and temporal distribution of these signals encode crucial information about the mass and abundance of compact lenses. Through the collective stochastic signal, LSD offers an order-of-magnitude improvement over single lens analysis for objects with mass $\gtrsim 10^3 M_\odot$. This gain can improve limits on compact dark-matter halos and allows next-generation instruments to detect supermassive black holes, given the abundance inferred from quasar luminosity studies.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of dark matter absorption in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the nuclear absorption of dark matter as an alternative to the typical indirect detection search channels of dark matter decay or annihilation. In this scenario, an atomic nucleus transitions to an excited state by absorbing a pseudoscalar dark matter particle and promptly emits a photon as it transitions back to its ground state. The nuclear excitation of carbon and oxygen in the Galactic Center would produce a discrete photon spectrum in the $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV range that could be detected by gamma-ray telescopes. Using the \texttt{BIGSTICK} large-scale shell-model code, we calculate the excitation energies of carbon and oxygen. We constrain the dark matter-nucleus coupling for current COMPTEL data, and provide projections for future experiments AMEGO-X, e-ASTROGAM, and GRAMS for dark matter masses from $\sim$ 10 to 30 MeV. We find the excitation process to be very sensitive to the dark matter mass and find that the future experiments considered would improve constraints on the dark matter-nucleus coupling within an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Bayesian synthesis of astrometric wobble and total light curves in close binary supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the potential of Bayesian synthesis of upcoming multi-instrument data to extract orbital parameters and individual light curves of close binary supermassive black holes (CB-SMBH) with subparsec separations. Next generation (ng) interferometers, will make possible the observation of astrometric wobbles in CB-SMBH. Combining them with periodic variable time-domain data from surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), allows for a more information on CB-SMBH candidates compared to standalone observational methods. Our method reliably determines binary parameters and component fluxes from binary total flux across long-term, intermediate and short-term binary dynamics and observational configurations, assuming ten annual observations, even in short period "q-accrete" objects. Expected CB-SMBH astrometric wobbles constructed from binary dynamical parameters, might serve in refining observational strategies for CB-SMBH. Combination of inferred mass ratio, light curves of binary components, and observed photocenter wobbles can be a proxy for the activity states of CB-SMBH components.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $3.2 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 16 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitors do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are essentially determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\approx$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$, representing $\approx 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\sim 3000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\sim 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3 alike. Gaia BH3-like systems represent a common product of isolated binary evolution at low metallicity ($Z&lt;0.01$), but given the steep density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one in the halo at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Considering the estimated formation efficiency for both the isolated and dynamical formation channel, we conclude that they are almost equally likely to explain the origin of Gaia BH3.</description>

      <title>Emergence of hot corona and truncated disk in simulations of accreting stellar mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar mass black holes in X-ray binaries (XRBs) are known to display different states characterized by different spectral and timing properties, understood in the framework of a hot corona coexisting with a thin accretion disk whose inner edge is truncated. There are several open questions related to the nature and properties of the corona, the thin disk, and dynamics behind the hard state. This motivated us to perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of accretion flows onto a 10 solar masses black hole. We consider a two-temperature plasma, incorporate radiative cooling with bremmstrahlung, synchrotron and comptonization losses and approximate the Schwarzschild spacetime via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We varied the mass accretion rate in the range 0.02 &lt;= Mdot/Mdot_Edd &lt;= 0.35. Our simulations show the natural emergence of a colder truncated thin disk embedded in a hot corona, as required to explain the hard state of XRBs. We found that as Mdot increases, the corona contracts and the inner edge of the thin disk gets closer to the event horizon. At a critical accretion rate 0.02 &lt;= Mdot_crit\Mdot_Edd &lt;= 0.06, the thin disk disappears entirely. We discuss how our simulations compare with XRB observations in the hard state.</description>

      <title>Supernovae in 2023 (review): possible breakthroughs by late observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a review of how late observations of supernovae, of the nebular phase, and much later of supernova remnants (SNRs), and their analysis in 2023 made progress towards possible breakthroughs in supporting the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and in introducing the group of lonely white dwarf (WD) scenarios for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The new analyses of CCSN remnants (CCSNRs) reveal point-symmetric morphologies in a way unnoticed before in several CCSNRs. Qualitative comparison to multipolar planetary nebulae that are shaped by jets suggests that jets exploded these CCSNe, as predicted by the JJEM, but incompatible with the prediction of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism. The spherical morphology of the ejecta Pa 30 of the historical type Iax supernova (SN Iax) of 1181 AD, which studies in 2023 revealed, is mostly compatible with the explosion of a lonely WD. Namely, at the explosion time, there is only a WD, without any close companion, although the WD was formed via a close binary interaction, i.e., binary merger. Identifying point-symmetry in SNR G1.9+0.3, a normal SN Ia and the youngest SN in the Galaxy, suggests an SN explosion of a lonely WD inside a planetary nebula (an SNIP). The group of lonely WD scenarios includes the core degenerate scenario and the double degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay (MED) time. SN Ia explosions of lonely WDs are common and might actually account for most (or even all) normal SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Metastability of stratified magnetohydrostatic equilibria and their relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by explosive releases of energy in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas, we consider the nonlinear stability of stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria against interchanges of straight magnetic-flux tubes. We demonstrate that in MHD (unlike in hydrodynamics) linear stability does not guarantee nonlinear stability, even in this simple case. We show that the minimum-energy configurations attainable by metastable equilibria under non-diffusive 2D dynamics can be determined by solving a combinatorial optimization problem. These minimum-energy states are, to good approximation, the final states reached by simulations of destabilized metastable equilibria where turbulent mixing is suppressed by viscosity. For the case of fully turbulent relaxation, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximization of Boltzmann's mixing entropy. This theory is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical mechanics of stellar systems and collisionless plasmas and to the Robert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence. Our theory reproduces well the results of our numerical simulations for sufficiently large perturbations to the metastable equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Based on the horizon-scale magnetofluid model developed in [arXiv:2309.13304], we investigate the millimeter-wave images of a geometrically thick accretion disk or a funnel wall, i.e., the magnetofluid that encloses the base of the jet region, around a Kerr black hole. By employing the numerical method to solve the null geodesic and radiative transfer equations, we obtain the optical appearances at various observational angles and frequencies, generated by the thermal synchrotron radiation within the magnetofluid. For the thick disk, we specifically examine the impact of emission anisotropy on images, concluding that anisotropic synchrotron radiation could play an important role in the observability of the photon ring. For the funnel wall, we find that both the outflow and inflow funnel walls exhibit annular structures on the imaging plane. The outflow funnel wall yields a brighter primary image than the photon ring, whereas the inflow one does not. Based on our investigation, the inflow funnel wall model can not be ruled out by current observations of M87*.</description>

      <title>Type Ia supernova explosion models are inherently multidimensional</title>

Abstract: Theoretical and observational approaches to settling the important questions surrounding the progenitor systems and the explosion mechanism of normal Type Ia supernovae have thus far failed. With its unique capability to obtain continuous spectra through the near- and mid-infrared, JWST now offers completely new insights into Type Ia supernovae. In particular, observing them in the nebular phase allows us to directly see the central ejecta and thereby constrain the explosion mechanism. We aim to understand and quantify differences in the structure and composition of the central ejecta of various Type Ia supernova explosion models. We examined the currently most popular explosion scenarios using self-consistent multidimensional explosion simulations of delayed-detonation and pulsationally assisted, gravitationally confined delayed detonation Chandrasekhar-mass models and double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar-mass and violent merger models. We find that the distribution of radioactive and stable nickel in the final ejecta, both observable in nebular spectra, are significantly different between different explosion scenarios. Therefore, comparing synthetic nebular spectra with JWST observations should allow us to distinguish between explosion models. We show that the explosion ejecta are inherently multidimensional for all models, and the Chandrasekhar-mass explosions simulated in spherical symmetry in particular lead to a fundamentally unphysical ejecta structure. Moreover, we show that radioactive and stable nickel cover a significant range of densities at a fixed velocity of the homologously expanding ejecta. Any radiation transfer postprocessing has to take these variations into account to obtain faithful synthetic observables; this will likely require multidimensional radiation transport simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing the accretion geometry of the atoll source 4U 1702-429 in different spectral states with NICER, NuSTAR, and AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive spectral study of a carefully selected sample (total exposure $\sim 50.5$ ks) of NICER observations of the atoll neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1702-429. Our sample encompasses nearly all classical spectral states found within the NICER dataset. We require two thermal emission components, originating from the accretion disc and the boundary layer, to describe the soft state spectra in the energy band 0.3-10.0 keV. In contrast, in our model, only the disc component directly contributes to the intermediate/hard state. Additionally, we use a thermally Comptonized component (or a power-law with pegged normalization) to represent the hard coronal emission in the soft and intermediate/hard state spectra. The boundary layer emerges as the principal source providing soft seed photons for Comptonization across all spectral states. In contrast to a previously held assertion regarding this source, our analyses reveal a decrease in the inner disc temperature coupled with the retreat of the inner disc from the neutron star surface as the source evolves from the soft to the intermediate/hard state. The reflection features are either absent or weak ($\sim 3\sigma-4\sigma$) in all these observations. Further investigation using broad-band NuSTAR (3.0-50.0 keV) and AstroSat spectra (1.3-25.0 keV) shows a slightly stronger iron emission line ($\sim 5.8\sigma$) in the NuSTAR spectra. However, this feature is not significantly detected in the AstroSat observation. The AstroSat data suggests a highly ionized disc, explaining the absence of reflection features. In the case of NuSTAR, a truncated disc is likely responsible for the weak reflection features.</description>

      <title>A Chandra Search for Periodic X-ray Sources in the Bulge of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for periodic X-ray sources in the bulge of M31, using ~ 2 Ms of archival Chandra observations spanning a temporal baseline of 16 years. Utilizing the Gregory-Loredo algorithm that is designed for photon-counting, phase-folded light curves, we detect seven periodic X-ray sources, among which four are newly discovered. Three of these sources are novae, the identified periods of which range between 1.3-2.0 hour and is most likely the orbital period. The other four sources are low-mass X-ray binaries, the identified periods of which range between 0.13-19.3 hour and are also likely orbital due to a clear eclipsing/dipping behavior in the light curve. We address implications on the X-ray binary population of the M31 bulge. Our study demonstrates the potential of using archival X-ray observations to systematically identify periodic X-ray sources in external galaxies, which would provide valuable information about the underlying exotic stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Supermassive Compact Dark Matter with the Millilensing Effect of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing effect is one of most significant observational probes to investigate compact dark matter/objects over a wide mass range. In this work, we first propose to derive the population information and the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter in the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$ from 6 millilensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates in 3000 Fermi GRB events using the hierarchical Bayesian inference method. We obtain that, for the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$, the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter is $f_{\rm CO}=10^{-1.60}$ in the log-normal mass distribution scenario. This result is in obvious tension with some other observational constraints, e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs and dynamical friction. However, it also was argued that there is only one system in these 6 candidates has been identified as lensed GRB event with fairly high confidence. In this case, the tension would be significantly alleviated. Therefore, it would be an interesting clue for both the millilensed GRB identification and the formation mechanism of supermassive compact dark matter.</description>

      <title>X-ray variability of the triplet star system LTT1445 and evaporation history of the exoplanets around its A component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-energy environment of the host stars could be deleterious for their planets. It is crucial to ascertain this contextual information to fully characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. We aim to fully characterize a unique triple system, LTT1445, with three known rocky exoplanets around LTT 1445A. The X-ray irradiation and flaring of this system are studied through a new 50 ks Chandra observation, which is divided into 10 ks, 10 ks, and 30 ks segments conducted two days apart, and two months apart, respectively. This is complemented by an archival Chandra observation approximately one year earlier and repeated observations with eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, enabling the investigation of X-ray flux behavior across multiple time scales. With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star A, we estimate the photo-evaporation mass loss of each exoplanet. With the planet modeling package, VPLanet, we predict the evolution and anticipated current atmospheric conditions. Our Chandra observations indicate LTT 1445C as the dominant X-ray source, with additional contribution from LTT 1445B. LTT 1445A, a slowly-rotating star, exhibits no significant flare activity in the new Chandra dataset. Comparing the flux incident on the exoplanets, LTT 1445BC components do not pose a greater threat to the planets orbiting LTT 1445A than the emission from A itself. According to the results from the simulation, LTT 1445Ad might have the capacity to retain its water surface.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Relativistic Jet in the High-Redshift Blazar OH~471</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time.
  Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe.
  Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471.
  Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy.
  Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.</description>
