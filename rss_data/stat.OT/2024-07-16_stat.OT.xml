      <title>Toward a Complete Criterion for Value of Information in Insoluble Decision Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a decision problem, observations are said to be material if they must be taken into account to perform optimally. Decision problems have an underlying (graphical) causal structure, which may sometimes be used to evaluate certain observations as immaterial. For soluble graphs - ones where important past observations are remembered - there is a complete graphical criterion; one that rules out materiality whenever this can be done on the basis of the graphical structure alone. In this work, we analyse a proposed criterion for insoluble graphs. In particular, we prove that some of the conditions used to prove immateriality are necessary; when they are not satisfied, materiality is possible. We discuss possible avenues and obstacles to proving necessity of the remaining conditions.</description>

      <title>Alternative proof for the bias of the hot hand statistic of streak length one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a sequence of $n$ random variables taking values $0$ or $1$, the hot hand statistic of streak length $k$ counts what fraction of the streaks of length $k$, that is, $k$ consecutive variables taking the value $1$, among the $n$ variables are followed by another $1$. Since this statistic does not use the expected value of how many streaks of length $k$ are observed, but instead uses the realization of the number of streaks present in the data, it may be a biased estimator of the conditional probability of a fixed random variable taking value $1$ if it is preceded by a streak of length $k$, as was first studied and observed explicitly in [Miller and Sanjurjo, 2018]. In this short note, we suggest an alternative proof for an explicit formula of the expectation of the hot hand statistic for the case of streak length one. This formula was obtained through a different argument in [Miller and Sanjurjo, 2018] and [Rinott and Bar-Hillel, 2015].</description>
