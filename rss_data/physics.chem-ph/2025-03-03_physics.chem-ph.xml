      <title>Kinetic energy density functional based on electron distribution on the energy coordinate to describe covalent bond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of kinetic energy functional (KEF) is known as one of the most difficult subjects in the electronic density functional theory (DFT). In particular, the sound description of chemical bonds using a KEF is a matter of great significance in the field of theoretical physics and chemistry. It can be readily confirmed that the famous Thomas-Fermi (TF) model or the TF model corrected with a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) fails to realize the bound state of a covalent bond in general. In this work, a new kinetic energy functional is developed on the basis of the novel density functional theory (J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 51, 055102, 2018) that utilizes the electron distribution on the energy coordinate as the fundamental variable. It is demonstrated for an H$_2$ molecule that the bound state can be realized by the KEF by virtue of the property of the electron density on the energy coordinate. The mechanism underlying the formation of the bound state is the same as that for the realization of the static correlation in the exchange energy described with the new DFT. We also developed a method termed potential gradient method to make a correction to the TF model instead of the GGA approach.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of Deep Eutectic Systems from Cluster-Optimized Energy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating energy functions for heterogeneous systems suitable for quantitative and predictive atomistic simulations is a challenging undertaking. The present work combines a cluster-based approach with electronic structure calculations at the density functional theory level and machine learning-based energy functions for a spectroscopic reporter for eutectic mixtures consisting of water, acetamide and KSCN. Two water models are considered: TIP3P which is consistent with the CGenFF energy function and TIP4P which - as a water model - is superior to TIP4P. Both fitted models, {\bf M2$^{\rm TIP3P}$} and {\bf
  M2$^{\rm TIP4P}$}, yield favourable thermodynamic, structural, spectroscopic and transport properties from extensive molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, the slow and fast decay times from 2-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and the viscosity for water-rich mixtures are described realistically and consistent with experiments. On the other hand, including the co-solvent (acetamide) in the present case is expected to further improve the computed viscosity for low-water content. It is concluded that such a cluster-based approach is a promising and generalizable route for routine parametrization of heterogeneous, electrostatically dominated systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing zero-shot generalisation behaviour in graph-neural-network interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapidly growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for chemistry, much current research focuses on the development of generally applicable and ``foundational'' MLIPs. An important question in this context is whether, and how well, such models can transfer from one application domain to another. Here, we assess this transferability for an MLIP model at the interface of materials and molecular chemistry. Specifically, we study GO-MACE-23, a model designed for the extended covalent network of graphene oxide, and quantify its zero-shot performance for small, isolated molecules and chemical reactions outside its direct scope--in direct comparison with a state-of-the-art model which has been trained in-domain. Our work provides quantitative insight into the transfer and generalisation ability of graph-neural-network potentials and, more generally, makes a step towards the more widespread applicability of MLIPs in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Cyanothiazole Copper(I) Complexes: Uncharted Materials with Exceptional Optical and Conductive Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine-tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X-ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as {\pi}-{\pi} stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen-chalcogen I-S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in FTIR, NMR, and UV-Vis spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with XANES synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.</description>

      <title>Structural Insights and Advanced Spectroscopic Characterization of Thiazolothiazoles: Unveiling Potential for Optoelectronic and Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thiazolothiazoles (TzTz) represent a class of compounds with distinctive structural motifs and exceptional optical properties, positioning them as promising candidates for breakthroughs in optoelectronic and sensing technologies. X-ray crystallographic analyses of TzTz units symmetrically substituted with functional groups such as imidazole, o-vanillin, p-vanillin, phenyl, thiazole, cinnamate, and bistrifluoromethylphenyl have revealed complex structural features, including {\pi}-{\pi} stacking interactions, hydrogen-bond networks, and specific chalcogen and halogen interactions. These interactions collectively enhance the stability and define the unique spectroscopic profiles of these compounds. Beyond classical spectral fingerprints (FTIR, NMR, and UV-Vis spectra), fluorescence studies at various temperatures, complemented by XANES synchrotron analyses, have underscored their remarkable thermal and electronic properties. The findings presented here offer a comprehensive framework for the characterization and analysis of TzTz compounds, emphasizing their potential as components in smart electronic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with quantum selected configuration interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using the wave function generated by the quantum selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method as the trial wave function in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). In the QSCI framework, electronic configurations are sampled from the quantum state realized on a quantum computer. These configurations serve as basis states for constructing an effective Hamiltonian, which is then diagonalized to obtain the corresponding eigenstate. Using this wave function, ph-AFQMC is performed to recover the dynamical electron correlation across the whole orbital space. The use of the QSCI trial wave function is expected to improve the feasibility of the quantum-classical (QC) hybrid quantum Monte Carlo approach [Nature, 603, 416 (2022)]. We call this integrated approach QC-QSCI-AFQMC, or QSCI-AFQMC for short. This method is validated across several molecular systems. For H2O and a linear H4 chain, we achieved chemical accuracy in most investigations relative to full configuration interaction while utilizing superconducting quantum computers at Osaka University and RIKEN. Additionally, the application of QSCI-AFQMC to the O-H bond dissociation in an organic molecule highlights the complementary synergy between capturing static correlation on quantum hardware and incorporating dynamical correlation via classical post-processing. For the N2, when QSCI-AFQMC is executed with a noiseless simulator, it ranks among the most accurate methods compared to various multireference electronic structure theories. Although the proposed method is demonstrated using small active spaces on current quantum devices, the concept is not limited to few-qubit problems. The QSCI-AFQMC can compete with state-of-the-art classical computational techniques, particularly in larger active spaces, displaying considerable potential for resolving classically intractable problems in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Energy-filtered excited states and real-time dynamics served in a contour integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is observed that the Cauchy integral formula (CIF) can be used to represent holomorphic functions of diagonalizable operators on a finite domain. This forms the theoretical foundation for applying various operators in the form of a contour integral to a state, while filtering away eigen-components that are not included by the contour. As a special case, the identity operator in the integral form--the Riesz projector--is used to design an algorithm for finding a given number of eigen-pairs whose energies are close to a specified value in the equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) framework, with applications to calculate core excited states of molecules which is relevant for the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a generalization, I showcase a novel real-time electron dynamics (RT-EOM-CCSD) algorithm based on the CIF form of the exponential time-evolution operator, which admits extremely large time steps while preserving accurate spectral information.</description>

      <title>Entropy Scaling for Diffusion Coefficients in Fluid Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy scaling is a powerful technique that has been used for predicting transport properties of pure components over a wide range of states. However, modeling mixture diffusion coefficients by entropy scaling is an unresolved task. We tackle this issue and present an entropy scaling framework for predicting mixture self-diffusion coefficients as well as mutual diffusion coefficients in a thermodynamically consistent way. The predictions of the mixture diffusion coefficients are made based on information on the self-diffusion coefficients of the pure components and the infinite-dilution diffusion coefficients. This is accomplished using information on the entropy of the mixture, which is taken here from molecular-based equations of state. Examples for the application of the entropy scaling framework for the prediction of diffusion coefficients in mixtures illustrate its performance. It enables predictions over a wide range of temperatures and pressures including gaseous, liquid, supercritical, and metastable states - also for strongly non-ideal mixtures.</description>

      <title>Configuration weights in coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of the weight of any given Slater determinant in the coupled-cluster state, namely as the expectation value of the projection operator onto that determinant. The definition can be applied to any coupled-cluster formulation, including conventional coupled-cluster theory, perturbative coupled-cluster models, nonorthogonal orbital-optimized coupled-cluster theory, and extended coupled-cluster theory, allowing for wave-function analyses on par with configuration-interaction-based wave functions. Numerical experiments show that for single-reference systems the coupled-cluster weights are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full configuration-interaction wave function. Moreover, the well-known insensitivity of the total energy obtained from truncated coupled-cluster models to the choice of orbital basis is clearly exposed by weights computed in the $\hat{T}_1$-transformed determinant basis. We demonstrate that the inseparability of the conventional linear parameterization of the bra (left state) for systems composed of noninteracting subsystems may lead to ill-behaved (negative or greater than unity) weights, an issue that can only be fully remedied by switching to extended coupled-cluster theory. The latter is corroborated by results obtained with quadratic coupled-cluster theory, which is shown numerically to yield a significant improvement.</description>

      <title>DeePMD-kit v3: A Multiple-Backend Framework for Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become indispensable tools in physics, chemistry, and materials science, driving the development of software packages for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and related applications. These packages, typically built on specific machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX, face integration challenges when advanced applications demand communication across different frameworks. The previous TensorFlow-based implementation of DeePMD-kit exemplified these limitations. In this work, we introduce DeePMD-kit version 3, a significant update featuring a multi-backend framework that supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and PaddlePaddle backends, and demonstrate the versatility of this architecture through the integration of other MLPs packages and of Differentiable Molecular Force Field. This architecture allows seamless backend switching with minimal modifications, enabling users and developers to integrate DeePMD-kit with other packages using different machine learning frameworks. This innovation facilitates the development of more complex and interoperable workflows, paving the way for broader applications of MLPs in scientific research.</description>
