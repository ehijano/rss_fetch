      <title>Actionable forecasting as a determinant of function in noisy biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous adaptation to variable environments is crucial for the survival of living organisms. Here, we analyze how adaptation, forecasting, and resource mobilization towards a target state, termed actionability, interact to determine biological function. We develop a general theory and show that it is possible for organisms to continuously track their optimal state in a dynamic environment by adapting towards an actionable target that incorporates just current information on the optimal state and its rate of change. If the environmental information is precise and readily actionable, it is possible to implement perfect tracking without anticipatory mechanisms, irrespective of the adaptation rate. In contrast, predictive functions, like those of circadian rhythms, are beneficial if sensing the environment is slow or unreliable, as they allow better adaptation with fewer resources. To explore potential actionable forecasting mechanisms, we develop a general approach that implements the adaptation dynamics with forecasting through a dynamics-informed neural network.</description>

      <title>Energy Complexity of Software in Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0505007</link>
      <description>arXiv:nlin/0505007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract:   The importance of low power consumption is widely acknowledged due to the increasing use of portable devices, which require minimizing the consumption of energy. The energy in a computational system depends heavily on the software being executed, since it determines the activity in the underlying circuitry. In this paper we introduce the notion of energy complexity of an algorithm for estimating the required energy consumption. As test vehicle we employ matrix multiplication algorithms and from the results it can be observed that energy complexity in combination with computational complexity, provides an accurate estimation for the energy consumed in the system.</description>
