      <title>Nonholonomic momentum map reduction and a Chaplygin-type foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a set-up for momentum map reduction of nonholonomic systems with symmetries, extending previous constructions in [3,25], based on the existence of certain conserved quantities and making essential use of the nonholonomic momentum bundle map of [10]. We show that the reductions of the momentum level sets carry an almost symplectic form codifying the reduced dynamics. These reduced manifolds are the leaves of the foliation associated with an almost Poisson bracket obtained by a (dynamically compatible) gauge transformation of the nonholonomic bracket. We show that each leaf is a "Chaplygin-type leaf", in the sense that it is isomorphic to a cotangent bundle with the canonical symplectic form plus a "magnetic term".</description>

      <title>Mathematical foundations of phonons in incommensurate materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some models, periodic configurations can be shown to be stable under, both, global $\ell^2$ or local perturbations. This is not the case for aperiodic media. The specific class of aperiodic media we are interested, in arise from taking two 2D periodic crystals and stacking them parallel at a relative twist. In periodic media, phonons are generalized eigenvectors for a stability operator acting on $\ell^2$, coming from a mechanical energy. The goal of our analysis is to provide phonons in the given class of aperiodic media with meaning. As rigorously established for the 1D Frenkel-Kontorova model and previously applied by one of the authors, we assume that we can parametrize minimizing lattice deformations w.r.t. local perturbations via continuous stacking-periodic functions, for which we previously derived a continuous energy density functional. Such (continuous) energy densities are analytically and computationally much better accessible compared to discrete energy functionals. In order to pass to an $\ell^2$-based energy functional, we also study the offset energy w.r.t. given lattice deformations, under $\ell^1$-perturbations. Our findings show that, in the case of an undeformed bilayer heterostructure, while the energy density can be shown to be stable under the assumption of stability of individual layers, the offset energy fails to be stable in the case of twisted bilayer graphene. We then establish conditions for stability and instability of the offset energy w.r.t. the relaxed lattice. Finally, we show that, in the case of incommensurate bilayer homostructures, i.e., two equal layers, if we choose minimizing deformations according to the global energy density above, the offset energy is stable in the limit of zero twist angle. Consequently, in this case, one can then define phonons as generalized eigenvectors w.r.t. the stability operator associated with the offset energy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Dirac operator on a curved strip whose boundary carries the infinite mass boundary condition. When the magnetic field is large, we provide the reader with accurate estimates of the essential and discrete spectra. In particular, we give sufficient conditions ensuring that the discrete spectrum is non-empty.</description>

      <title>Les Houches lecture notes on topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: You may have seen the words "topological recursion" mentioned in papers on matrix models, Hurwitz theory, Gromov-Witten theory, topological string theory, knot theory, topological field theory, JT gravity, cohomological field theory, free probability theory, gauge theories, to name a few. The goal of these lecture notes is certainly not to explain all these applications of the topological recursion framework. Rather, the intention is to provide a down-to-earth (and hopefully accessible) introduction to topological recursion itself, so that when you see these words mentioned, you can understand what it is all about. These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)" in Summer 2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short article, we will reconstruct the KP equation from Plucker relations and provide some generalizations on this topic. Additionally, in the final section, we define the discrete function $\tau$ in a similar manner, leading to the construction of an integer sequence that has not yet been listed in the OEIS. Furthermore, this approach allows us to construct many other sequences that are not listed in the OEIS.</description>

      <title>Zero Flux Localization: Magic Revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands correspond to the spatial localization of a quantum particle moving in a field with discrete or continuous translational invariance. The canonical example is the flat Landau levels in a homogeneous magnetic field. Several significant problems -- including flat bands in moir\'e structures -- are related to the problem of a particle moving in an inhomogeneous magnetic field with zero total flux. We demonstrate that while perfectly flat bands in such cases are impossible, the introduction of a "non-Abelian component" -- a spin field with zero total curvature -- can lead to perfect localization. Several exactly solvable models are constructed: (i) a half-space up/down field with a sharp 1D boundary; (ii) an alternating up/down field periodic in one direction on a cylinder; and (iii) a doubly periodic alternating field on a torus. The exact solution on the torus is expressed in terms of elliptic functions. It is shown that flat bands are only possible for certain magic values of the field corresponding to a quantized flux through an individual tile. These exact solutions clarify the simple structure underlying flat bands in moir\'e materials and provide a springboard for constructing a novel class of fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Plateaux of probability for the expanded quantum infinite well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the standard 1D quantum infinite potential well initially in its ground state suffers a sudden expansion, it turns out that in the evolution of the system they may appear plateaux of probability for some fractional times, as noticed by C. Aslangul in 2008. We introduce a mathematical framework to explain this phenomenon. Remarkably, the characterization of these plateaux depends on nontrivial number theoretical considerations.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic delocalization of low temperature 3D Ising and Potts interfaces above a hard floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entropic repulsion of the low temperature 3D Ising and Potts interface in an $n\times n \times n$ box with blue boundary conditions on its bottom face (the hard floor), and red boundary conditions on its other five faces. For Ising, Frohlich and Pfister proved in 1987 that the typical interface height above the origin diverges (non-quantitatively), via correlation inequalities special to the Ising model; no such result was known for Potts. We show for both the Ising and Potts models that the entropic repulsion fully overcomes the potentially attractive interaction with the floor, and obtain a logarithmically diverging lower bound on the typical interface height. This is complemented by a conjecturally sharp upper bound of $\lfloor \xi^{-1}\log n\rfloor$ where $\xi$ is the rate function for a point-to-plane non-red connection under the infinite volume red measure. The proof goes through a coupled random-cluster interface to overcome the potential attractive interaction with the boundary, and a coupled fuzzy Potts model to reduce the upper bound to a simpler setting where the repulsion is attained by conditioning a no-floor interface to lie in the upper half-space.</description>

      <title>A Second Moment Method for k-Eigenvalue Acceleration with Continuous Diffusion and Discontinuous Transport Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second moment method is a linear acceleration technique which couples the transport equation to a diffusion equation with transport-dependent additive closures. The resulting low-order diffusion equation can be discretized independent of the transport discretization, unlike diffusion synthetic acceleration, and is symmetric positive definite, unlike quasi-diffusion. While this method has been shown to be comparable to quasi-diffusion in iterative performance for fixed source and time-dependent problems, it is largely unexplored as an eigenvalue problem acceleration scheme due to thought that the resulting inhomogeneous source makes the problem ill-posed. Recently, a preliminary feasibility study was performed on the second moment method for eigenvalue problems. The results suggested comparable performance to quasi-diffusion and more robust performance than diffusion synthetic acceleration. This work extends the initial study to more realistic reactor problems using state-of-the-art discretization techniques. Results in this paper show that the second moment method is more computationally efficient than its alternatives on complex reactor problems with unstructured meshes.</description>

      <title>Ocneanu Algebra of Seams: Critical Unitary $E_6$ RSOS Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $A$ series and exceptional $E_6$ Restricted Solid-On-Solid lattice models as prototypical examples of the critical Yang-Baxter integrable two-dimensional $A$-$D$-$E$ lattice models. We focus on type I theories which are characterized by the existence of an extended chiral symmetry in the continuum scaling limit. Starting with the commuting family of column transfer matrices on the torus, we build matrix representations of the Ocneanu graph fusion algebra as integrable seams for arbitrary finite-size lattices with the structure constants specified by Petkova and Zuber. This commutative seam algebra contains the Verlinde, fused adjacency and graph fusion algebras as subalgebras. Our matrix representation of the Ocneanu algebra encapsulates the quantum symmetry of the commuting family of transfer matrices. In the continuum scaling limit, the integrable seams realize the topological defects of the associated conformal field theory and the known toric matrices encode the twisted conformal partition functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The S-dual $(\mathbf G^\vee\curvearrowright\mathbf M^\vee)$ of the pair $(\mathbf G\curvearrowright\mathbf M)$ of a smooth affine algebraic symplectic manifold $\mathbf M$ with hamiltonian action of a complex reductive group $\mathbf G$ was introduced implicitly in [arXiv:1706.02112] and explicitly in [arXiv:1807.09038] under the cotangent type assumption. The definition was a modification of the definition of Coulomb branches of gauge theories in [arXiv:1601.03586]. It was motivated by the S-duality of boundary conditions of 4-dimensional $\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, studied by Gaiotto and Witten [arXiv:0807.3720]. It is also relevant to the relative Langlands duality proposed by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh. In this article, we review the definition and properties of S-dual.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Neural Network Optimization: Insights from Input Dimension Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind neural network optimization is crucial for improving network design and performance. While various optimization techniques have been developed, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles that govern these techniques remains elusive. Specifically, the role of symmetry breaking, a fundamental concept in physics, has not been fully explored in neural network optimization. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to design networks that are both efficient and effective. Here, we propose the symmetry breaking hypothesis to elucidate the significance of symmetry breaking in enhancing neural network optimization. We demonstrate that a simple input expansion can significantly improve network performance across various tasks, and we show that this improvement can be attributed to the underlying symmetry breaking mechanism. We further develop a metric to quantify the degree of symmetry breaking in neural networks, providing a practical approach to evaluate and guide network design. Our findings confirm that symmetry breaking is a fundamental principle that underpins various optimization techniques, including dropout, batch normalization, and equivariance. By quantifying the degree of symmetry breaking, our work offers a practical technique for performance enhancement and a metric to guide network design without the need for complete datasets and extensive training processes.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Quantum Zeno and Strong Damping Limits in Strong Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequent applications of a mixing quantum operation to a quantum system slow down its time evolution and eventually drive it into the invariant subspace of the named operation. We prove this phenomenon, the quantum Zeno effect, and its continuous variant, strong damping, in a unified way for infinite-dimensional open quantum systems, while merely demanding that the respective mixing convergence holds pointwise for all states. Both results are quantitative in the following sense: Given the speed of convergence for the mixing limits, we can derive bounds on the convergence speed for the corresponding quantum Zeno and strong damping limits. We apply our results to prove quantum Zeno and strong damping limits for the photon loss channel with an explicit bound on the convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of Dirac operators for dislocated potentials with a purely imaginary jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a complete spectral analysis of Dirac operators with non-Hermitian matrix potentials of the form $i\operatorname{sgn}(x)+V(x)$ where $V\in L^1$. For $V=0$ we compute explicitly the matrix Green function. This allows us to determine the spectrum, which is purely essential, and its different types. It also allows us to find sharp enclosures for the pseudospectrum and its complement, in all parts of the complex plane. Notably, this includes the instability region, corresponding to the interior of the band that forms the numerical range. Then, with the help of a Birman-Schwinger principle, we establish in precise manner how the spectrum and pseudospectrum change when $V\not=0$, assuming the hypotheses $\|V\|_{L^1}&lt;1$ or $V\in L^1\cap L^p$ where $p&gt;1$. We show that the essential spectra remain unchanged and that the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum stays close to the instability region for small $\varepsilon$. We determine sharp asymptotic for the discrete spectrum, whenever $V$ satisfies further conditions of decay at infinity. Finally, in one of our main findings, we give a complete description of the weakly-coupled model.</description>

      <title>Spherical and hyperbolic orthogonal ring patterns: integrability and variational principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce orthogonal ring patterns in the 2-sphere and in the hyperbolic plane, consisting of pairs of concentric circles, which generalize circle patterns. We show that their radii are described by a discrete integrable system. This is a special case of the master integrable equation Q4. The variational description is given in terms of elliptic generalizations of the dilogarithm function. They have the same convexity principles as their circle-pattern counterparts. This allows us to prove existence and uniqueness results for the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. Some examples are computed numerically. In the limit of small smoothly varying rings, one obtains harmonic maps to the sphere and to the hyperbolic plane. A close relation to discrete surfaces with constant mean curvature is explained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the heat equation with Grushin's operator. We present an expression for its heat kernel and get regularity properties and decay on $L^p$ spaces for both heat Kernel and semigroup associated to Grushin's operator. Next, we use the results to prove the existence, uniqueness, continuous dependence and blowup alternative of mild solutions of a nonlinear Cauchy's problem associated to Grushin's operator.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of quenched and annealed random walk in mixing random environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of large deviation principles of random walk in strongly mixing environments. The quenched and annealed rate functions have the same zero set whose shape is either a singleton point or a line segment, with an illustrative example communicated and given by F. Rassoul-Agha. Whenever the level of disorder is controlled, the two rate functions agree on compact set at the boundary under mixing conditions and in the interior under finite-dependence condition. Along the line we also indicate that under slightly more refined conditions, there is a phase transition of the difference of two rate functions.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering amplitudes via analytic small-frequency expansion and monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize three complementary approaches to pinpoint the exact form of scattering amplitudes in Schwarzschild spacetime. First, we solve the Regge-Wheeler equation perturbatively in the small-frequency regime. We use the obtained solutions to determine the monodromy in the near-spatial infinity region, which leads to a specific partial differential equation on the elements of the scattering matrix. As a result, it can be written in terms of the elements of the infinitesimal generator of the monodromy transformation and an integration constant. This constant is further related to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili free energy through the resummation of infinitely many instantons. The quasinormal mode frequencies are also studied in the small-frequency approximation.</description>

Abstract: We present thought experiments to measure the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner and Bondi-Sachs energy of isolated systems in general relativity. The expression of the Bondi-Sachs energy used in the protocol is likely to have other applications. In particular, it is well-suited to to be promoted to an operator in non-perturbative loop quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Entropic repulsion of 3D Ising interfaces conditioned to stay above a floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interface of the Ising model in a box of side-length $n$ in $\mathbb Z^3$ at low temperature $1/\beta$ under Dobrushin's boundary conditions, conditioned to stay in a half-space above height $h$ (a hard floor). Without this conditioning, Dobrushin showed in 1972 that typically most of the interface is flat at height $0$. With the floor, for small $h$, the model is expected to exhibit {\it entropic repulsion}, where the typical height of the interface lifts off of $0$. Detailed understanding of the SOS model -- a more tractable height function approximation of 3D Ising -- due to Caputo et al., suggests that there is a single integer value $-h_n^* \sim -c\log n$ of the floor height, delineating the transition between rigidity at height $0$ and entropic repulsion.
  We identify an explicit $h_n^*=( c_\star+o(1))\log n$ such that, for the typical Ising interface above a hard floor at $h$, all but an $\epsilon(\beta)$-fraction of the sites are propelled to be above height $0$ if $h &lt; h_n^*-1$, whereas all but an $\epsilon(\beta)$-fraction of the sites remain at height $0$ if $h\geq h_n^*$. Further, $c_\star$ is such that the typical height of the unconditional maximum is $(2c_\star + o(1))\log n$; this confirms scaling predictions from the SOS approximation.</description>

      <title>Extrema of 3D Potts interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interface between the plus and minus phases in the low temperature 3D Ising model has been intensely studied since Dobrushin's pioneering works in the early 1970's established its rigidity. Advances in the last decade yielded the tightness of the maximum of the interface of this Ising model on the cylinder of side length $n$, around a mean that is asymptotically $c\log n$ for an explicit $c$ (temperature dependent). In this work, we establish analogous results for the 3D Potts and random cluster (FK) models. Compared to 3D Ising, the Potts model and its lack of monotonicity form obstacles for existing methods, calling for new proof ideas, while its interfaces (and associated extrema) exhibit richer behavior. We show that the maxima and minima of the interface bounding the blue component in the 3D Potts interface, and those of the interface bounding the bottom component in the 3D FK model, are governed by 4 different large deviation rates, whence the corresponding global extrema feature 4 distinct constants $c$ as above. Due to the above obstacles, our methods are initially only applicable to 1 of these 4 interface extrema, and additional ideas are needed to recover the other 3 rates given the behavior of the first one.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate multidimensional first-order quasi-linear systems and find necessary conditions for them to admit Hamiltonian formulation. The insufficiency of the conditions is related to the Poisson cohomology of the admissible Hamiltonian operators. We present in detail the examples of two-dimensional, two-components systems of hydrodynamic type and of a real reduction of the 3-waves system.</description>

Abstract: With the development of multi-layer elastic systems in the field of engineering mechanics, the corresponding variational inequality theory and algorithm design have received more attention and research. In this study, a class of equivalent saddle point problems with interlayer Tresca friction conditions and the mixed finite element method are proposed and analyzed. Then, the convergence of the numerical solution of the mixed finite element method is theoretically proven, and the corresponding algebraic dual algorithm is given. Finally, through numerical experiments, the mixed finite element method is not only compared with the layer decomposition method, but also its convergence relationship with respect to the spatial discretization parameter $H$ is verified.</description>

      <title>A Relationship Between Nonphysical Quasi-probabilities and Nonlocality Objectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density matrices are the most general descriptions of quantum states, covering both pure and mixed states. Positive semidefiniteness is a physical requirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of measuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some bipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that cannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that breaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a negative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the construction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but local when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent nonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative quasi-probabilities.</description>

      <title>On the Gardner Transition in the Ising Pure $p$-Spin Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) for the mean field Ising spin glasses at finite temperature and identify the first critical temperature in Gardner transition. Specifically, Gardner conjectured that for Ising pure $p$-spin glasses with $p\geq 3,$ there are two phase transitions: the Parisi measure is Replica Symmetric (RS) at high temperatures, then transitions to One-Step Replica Symmetry Breaking (1RSB) at a lower temperature, and finally reaches Full Replica Symmetry Breaking (FRSB) at very low temperatures. Our main results verify the first part of the Gardner transition: for any $p \geq 3,$ there exists a unique $\beta^p_1&gt;0$ such that the Parisi measure is RS for $0 &lt; \beta \leq \beta^p_{1}$ and then 1RSB for $\beta^p_1 &lt; \beta \leq \beta^p_1+\epsilon_p$ with some $\epsilon_p&gt;0.$ We also provide a computational method to locate $\beta^p_1$ for any $p \geq 3.$</description>

      <title>Optimal solutions employing an algebraic Variational Multiscale approach Part I: Steady Linear Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends our previous study from S. Shrestha et al. (2024) by introducing a new abstract framework for Variational Multiscale (VMS) methods at the discrete level. We introduce the concept of what we define as the optimal projector and present an approach where the infinite-dimensional unresolved scales are approximated in a finite-dimensional subspace using the numerically computed Fine-Scale Greens' function of the underlying symmetric problem. The proposed approach involves solving the VMS problem on two separate meshes: a coarse mesh for the full PDE and a fine mesh for the symmetric part of the continuous differential operator. We consider the 1D and 2D steady advection-diffusion problems in both direct and mixed formulations as the test cases in this paper. Moreover, we demonstrate the working of this method using the Mimetic Spectral Element Method (MSEM), however, it may be applied to other Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric frameworks. Furthermore, we propose that VMS should not be viewed as a stabilisation technique; instead, the base scheme should be inherently stable, with VMS enhancing the solution quality by supplementing the base scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we complete the program initiated by the first and second authors and rigorously derive a Boltzmann-type equation that incorporates higher order collisions among gas particles. More precisely, starting from a finite $N$-particle system where the particles can perform symmetric hard sphere type interactions up to arbitrarily high order $M$, we derive a kinetic equation which consists of a linear combination of higher order collisional terms. We identify the new scaling regime that facilitates such collisions and systematically generalize geometric techniques allowing us to analyze the correlation of potentially distinct order recollisions as time evolves.</description>
