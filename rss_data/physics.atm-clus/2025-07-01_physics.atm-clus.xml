      <title>Optical cycling of MgF molecules within the hyperfine states in X(N=1) state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the optical cycling effect of the $\mathrm{X}^2\Sigma(v=0,\ N=1^-) - \mathrm{A}^2\Pi_{1/2}(v'=0,\ J'=1/2^+)$ band of MgF molecules, specifically the $\mathrm{P_1/Q_{12}(1)}$ transition, which serves as the main transition in the quasi-closed cycling scheme for the laser cooling. A higher number of scattered photons was observed when all three frequency components of the $\mathrm{P_1/Q_{12}(1)}$ transition were simultaneously applied using acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). Optimal conditions were identified by scanning the detuning of frequency components, the laser beam power ratio, and the total laser beam power, and the results were confirmed through rate equation simulations. Under these optimized conditions, and with an applied magnetic field, the scattering rate was enhanced by approximately a factor of six. These results refine the implementation of optical cycling in MgF and lay the groundwork for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping (MOT) experiments.</description>

      <title>Tunable Field-Linked $s$-wave Interactions in Dipolar Fermi Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin mixtures of degenerate fermions are a cornerstone of quantum many-body physics, enabling superfluidity, polarons, and rich spin dynamics through $s$-wave scattering resonances. Combining them with strong, long-range dipolar interactions provides highly flexible control schemes promising even more exotic quantum phases. Recently, microwave shielding gave access to spin-polarized degenerate samples of dipolar fermionic molecules, where tunable $p$-wave interactions were enabled by field-linked resonances available only by compromising the shielding. Here, we study the scattering properties of a fermionic dipolar spin mixture and show that a universal $s$-wave resonance is readily accessible without compromising the shielding. We develop a universal description of the tunable $s$-wave interaction and weakly bound tetratomic states based on the microwave-field parameters. The $s$-wave resonance paves the way to stable, controllable and strongly-interacting dipolar spin mixtures of deeply degenerate fermions and supports favorable conditions to reach this regime via evaporative cooling.</description>

      <title>Multi-plateau high-harmonic generation in liquids driven by off-site recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative high-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently been observed in the liquid phase, where it was demonstrated to have a different physical mechanism compared to gas and solid phases of matter. The currently best physical picture for liquid HHG eliminates scattered-electron contributions and identifies on-site recombination as the dominant contributor. This mechanism accurately predicts the cut-off energy and its independence of the driving laser wavelength and intensity. However, this implies that additional energy absorbed in the liquid as the driving laser intensity is increased does not result in higher-order non-linearities, which is in contrast to the conventional expectation from most nonlinear media. Here we experimentally observe the formation of a second plateau in HHG from multiple liquids (water, heavy water, propranol, and ethanol), thus explaining the conundrum of the missing higher-order response. We analyze this second plateau with a combination of experimental, state-of-the-art ab-initio numerical (in diverse systems of water, ammonia, and liquid methane), and semi-classical analytical, techniques, and elucidate its physical origin to electrons that recombine on neighboring water molecules rather than at the ionization site, leading to unique HHG ellipticity dependence. Remarkably, we find that the second plateau is dominated by electrons recombining at the second solvation shell, relying on wide hole delocalization. Theory also predicts the appearance of even higher plateaus, indicating a general trend. Our work establishes new physical phenomena in the highly non-linear optical response of liquids, paving the way to attosecond probing of electron dynamics in solutions.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclei by smashing them at high energies: how are their shapes revealed after destruction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions has recently emerged as a powerful ``imaging-by-smashing'' tool to reveal the global shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I layout a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>
