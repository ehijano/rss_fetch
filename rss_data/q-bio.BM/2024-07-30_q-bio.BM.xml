      <title>On Machine Learning Approaches for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binding affinity optimization is crucial in early-stage drug discovery. While numerous machine learning methods exist for predicting ligand potency, their comparative efficacy remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance of classical tree-based models and advanced neural networks in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our comprehensive benchmarking encompasses 2D models utilizing ligand-only RDKit embeddings and Large Language Model (LLM) ligand representations, as well as 3D neural networks incorporating bound protein-ligand conformations. We assess these models across multiple standard datasets, examining various predictive scenarios including classification, ranking, regression, and active learning. Results indicate that simpler models can surpass more complex ones in specific tasks, while 3D models leveraging structural information become increasingly competitive with larger training datasets containing compounds with labelled affinity data against multiple targets. Pre-trained 3D models, by incorporating protein pocket environments, demonstrate significant advantages in data-scarce scenarios for specific binding pockets. Additionally, LLM pretraining on 2D ligand data enhances complex model performance, providing versatile embeddings that outperform traditional RDKit features in computational efficiency. Finally, we show that combining 2D and 3D model strengths improves active learning outcomes beyond current state-of-the-art approaches. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing machine learning strategies in drug discovery pipelines.</description>

      <title>RNACG: A Universal RNA Sequence Conditional Generation model based on Flow-Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA plays a crucial role in diverse life processes. In contrast to the rapid advancement of protein design methods, the work related to RNA is more demanding. Most current RNA design approaches concentrate on specified target attributes and rely on extensive experimental searches. However, these methods remain costly and inefficient due to practical limitations. In this paper, we characterize all sequence design issues as conditional generation tasks and offer parameterized representations for multiple problems. For these problems, we have developed a universal RNA sequence generation model based on flow matching, namely RNACG. RNACG can accommodate various conditional inputs and is portable, enabling users to customize the encoding network for conditional inputs as per their requirements and integrate it into the generation network. We evaluated RNACG in RNA 3D structure inverse folding, 2D structure inverse folding, family-specific sequence generation, and 5'UTR translation efficiency prediction. RNACG attains superior or competitive performance on these tasks compared with other methods. RNACG exhibits extensive applicability in sequence generation and property prediction tasks, providing a novel approach to RNA sequence design and potential methods for simulation experiments with large-scale RNA sequence data.</description>

      <title>GraphBPE: Molecular Graphs Meet Byte-Pair Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing attention to molecular machine learning, various innovations have been made in designing better models or proposing more comprehensive benchmarks. However, less is studied on the data preprocessing schedule for molecular graphs, where a different view of the molecular graph could potentially boost the model's performance. Inspired by the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm, a subword tokenization method popularly adopted in Natural Language Processing, we propose GraphBPE, which tokenizes a molecular graph into different substructures and acts as a preprocessing schedule independent of the model architectures. Our experiments on 3 graph-level classification and 3 graph-level regression datasets show that data preprocessing could boost the performance of models for molecular graphs, and GraphBPE is effective for small classification datasets and it performs on par with other tokenization methods across different model architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Long Short-Term Memory for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing combined with machine learning (ML) is an extremely promising research area, with numerous studies demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to solve scientific problems more effectively than classical ML. In this work, we successfully apply QML to drug discovery, showing that QML can significantly improve model performance and achieve faster convergence compared to classical ML. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model accuracy of the QML improves as the number of qubits increases. We also introduce noise to the QML model and find that it has little effect on our experimental conclusions, illustrating the high robustness of the QML model. This work highlights the potential application of quantum computing to yield significant benefits for scientific advancement as the qubit quantity increase and quality improvement in the future.</description>

      <title>Differential Effects of Sequence-Local versus Nonlocal Charge Patterns on Phase Separation and Conformational Dimensions of Polyampholytes as Model Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformational properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are governed by a sequence-ensemble relationship. To differentiate the impact of sequence-local versus sequence-nonlocal features of an IDP's charge pattern on its conformational dimensions and its phase-separation propensity, the charge "blockiness'' $\kappa$ and the nonlocality-weighted sequence charge decoration (SCD) parameters are compared for their correlations with isolated-chain radii of gyration ($R_{\rm g}$s) and upper critical solution temperatures (UCSTs) of polyampholytes modeled by random phase approximation, field-theoretic simulation, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics. SCD is superior to $\kappa$ in predicting $R_{\rm g}$ because SCD accounts for effects of contact order, i.e., nonlocality, on dimensions of isolated chains. In contrast, $\kappa$ and SCD are comparably good, though nonideal, predictors of UCST because frequencies of interchain contacts in the multiple-chain condensed phase are less sensitive to sequence positions than frequencies of intrachain contacts of an isolated chain, as reflected by $\kappa$ correlating better with condensed-phase interaction energy than SCD.</description>
