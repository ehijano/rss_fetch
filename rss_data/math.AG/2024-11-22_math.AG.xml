      <title>Logarithmic geometry beyond fs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the foundations of logarithmic structures beyond the standard finiteness conditions. The motivation is the study of semistable models over general valuation rings. The key new notion is that of a morphism of finite presentation up to saturation (sfp), which is one that is qcqs and which is locally isomorphic to the saturated base change of a finitely presented morphism between fs log schemes. As in the case of schemes, sfp maps can (locally on the base) be approximated by maps between fs log schemes of finite type over $\mathbb{Z}$. Based on sfp maps, we define smooth, \'etale, and Kummer \'etale maps. Importantly, the maps of schemes underlying such maps are no longer of finite type in general, though surprisingly they are if the base is the spectrum of a valuation ring with algebraically closed field of fractions. These foundations allow us to extend beyond the fs case the theory of the Kummer \'etale site and of the Kummer \'etale fundamental group.</description>

      <title>Analytic torsion for irreducible holomorphic symplectic fourfolds with involution, II: the singularity of the invariant (with an Appendix by Ken-Ichi Yoshikawa)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary behavior of the invariant of $K3^{[2]}$-type manifolds with antisymplectic involution, which we obtained using equivariant analytic torsion. We show the algebraicity of the singularity of the invariant by using the asymptotic of equivariant Quillen metrics and equivariant $L^2$-metrics. We prove that, in some cases, the invariant coincides with Yoshikawa's invariant for 2-elementary K3 surfaces. Hence, in these cases, our invariant is expressed as the Petersson norm of a Borcherds product and a Siegel modular form.</description>

      <title>Counting 3-uple Veronese surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper culminates in the count of the number of 3-Veronese surfaces passing through 13 general points. This follows the case of 2-Veronese surfaces discovered by Coble in the 1920's. One important element of the calculation is a direct construction of a space of "complete triangles." Our construction is different from the classical ordered constructions of Schubert, Collino and Fulton, as it occurs directly on the Hilbert scheme of length 3 subschemes of the plane. We transport the enumerative problem into a 26-dimensional Grassmannian bundle over our space of complete triangles, where we perform Atiyah-Bott localization. Several important questions arise, which we collect at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>A description of and an upper bound on the set of bad primes in the study of the Casas-Alvero Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casas--Alvero conjecture predicts that every univariate polynomial over a field of characteristic zero having a common factor with each of its derivatives $H_i(f)$ is a power of a linear polynomial. One approach to proving the conjecture is to first prove it for polynomials of some small degree $n$, compile a list of bad primes for that degree (namely, those primes $p$ for which the conjecture fails in degree $n$ and characteristic $p$) and then deduce the conjecture for all degrees of the form $np^\ell$, $\ell\in \mathbb{N}$, where $p$ is a good prime for $n$. In this paper we give an explicit description of the set of bad primes in any given degree $n$. In particular, we show that if the conjecture holds in degree $n$ then the bad primes for $n$ are bounded above by $\binom{\frac{n^2-n}2}{n-2}!\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}\binom{i+n-2}{n-2}^{\binom{d-i+n-2}{n-2}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensors are ubiquitous in statistics and data analysis. The central object that links data science to tensor theory and algebra is that of a model with latent variables. We provide an overview of tensor theory, with a particular emphasis on its applications in algebraic statistics. This high-level treatment is supported by numerous examples to illustrate key concepts. Additionally, an extensive literature review is included to guide readers toward more detailed studies on the subject.</description>

      <title>Desingularization of bounded-rank tensor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank tensors appear to be prosperous in many applications. However, the sets of bounded-rank tensors are non-smooth and non-convex algebraic varieties, rendering the low-rank optimization problems to be challenging. To this end, we delve into the geometry of bounded-rank tensor sets, including Tucker and tensor train formats. We propose a desingularization approach for bounded-rank tensor sets by introducing slack variables, resulting in a low-dimensional smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space while preserving the structure of low-rank tensor formats. Subsequently, optimization on tensor varieties can be reformulated to optimization on smooth manifolds, where the methods and convergence are well explored. We reveal the relationship between the landscape of optimization on varieties and that of optimization on manifolds. Numerical experiments on tensor completion illustrate that the proposed methods are in favor of others under different rank parameters.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of K\"ahler--Frobenius manifolds and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to show that flat compact K\"ahler manifolds exhibit the structure of a Frobenius manifold, a structure originating in 2D Topological Quantum Field Theory and closely related to Joyce structure. As a result, we classify all such manifolds. It can be deduced that K\"ahler--Frobenius manifolds include certain Calabi--Yau manifolds, complex tori $T=\mathbb{C}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$, Hantzsche--Wendt manifolds, hyperelliptic manifolds and manifolds of type $T/G$, where $G$ is a finite group acting on $T$ freely and containing no translations. An explicit study is provided for the two-dimensional case. Additionally, we can prove that Chern's conjecture for K\"ahler pre-Frobenius manifolds holds. Lastly, we establish that certain classes of K\"ahler-Frobenius manifolds share a direct relationship with theta functions which are important objects in number theory as well as complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Diamantine Picard functors of rigid spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.16557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected smooth proper rigid space $X$ over a perfectoid field extension of $\mathbb Q_p$, we show that the \'etale Picard functor of $X$ defined on perfectoid test objects is the diamondification of the rigid analytic Picard functor. In particular, it is represented by a rigid analytic group variety if and only if the rigid analytic Picard functor is.
  Second, we study the $v$-Picard functor that parametrises line bundles in the finer $v$-topology on the diamond associated to $X$ and relate this to the rigid analytic Picard functor by a geometrisation of the multiplicative Hodge--Tate sequence.
  The motivation is an application to the $p$-adic Simpson correspondence, namely our results pave the way towards the first instance of a new moduli theoretic perspective.</description>

Abstract: We study Picard groups and Picard functors of perfectoid spaces which are limits of rigid spaces. For sufficiently large covers that are limits of rigid spaces of good reduction, we show that the Picard functor can be represented by the special fibre. We use our results to answer several open questions about Picard groups of perfectoid spaces from the literature, for example we show that these are not always $p$-divisible. Along the way, we construct a "Hodge--Tate spectral sequence for $\mathbb G_m$" of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We prove an analogue of Scholze's Primitive Comparison Theorem for proper rigid spaces over an algebraically closed non-archimedean field $K$ of characteristic $p$. This implies a v-topological version of the Primitive Comparison Theorem for proper finite type morphisms $f:X\to Y$ of analytic adic spaces over $\mathbb Z_p$. We deduce new cases of the Proper Base Change Theorem for $p$-torsion coefficients and the K\"unneth formula in this setting.</description>

      <title>Slices of Stable Polynomials and Connections to the Grace-Walsh-Szeg\H{o} theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Univariate polynomials are called stable with respect to a circular region $\mathcal{A}$, if all of their roots are in $\mathcal{A}$. We consider the special case where $\mathcal{A}$ is a half-plane and investigate affine slices of the set of stable polynomials. In this setup, we show that an affine slice of codimension $k$ always contains a stable polynomial that possesses at most $2(k+2)$ distinct roots on the boundary and at most $(k+2)$ distinct roots in the interior of $\mathcal{A}$. This result also extends to affine slices of weakly Hurwitz polynomials. Subsequently, we apply these results to symmetric polynomials and varieties. Here we show that it is necessary and sufficient for a variety described by polynomials in few multiaffine polynomials to contain points in $\mathcal{A}^n$ with few distinct coordinates for its intersection with $\mathcal{A}^n$ being non-empty. This is at the same time a generalization of the degree principle to stable polynomials and a result similar to Grace-Walsh-Szeg\H{o}'s coincidence theorem on multiaffine symmetric polynomials.</description>

The proposed algorithm is applicable both in classical context over a complex disk as well as in arithmetic setting over a spectrum of DVR. We illustrate algorithm's efficacy through three examples where we compute semistable degeneration and limiting mixed Hodge structure for explicit families of double octics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generating series of special cycles on $\mathcal{A}_1(N)\times \mathcal{A}_g(N)$, with full level $N$ structure, valued in the cohomology of degree $2g$. The modularity theorem of Kudla-Millson for locally symmetric spaces implies that these series are modular. When $N=1$, the images of these loci in $\mathcal{A}_g$ are the $d$-elliptic Noether-Lefschetz loci, which are conjectured to be modular. In the appendix, it is shown that the resulting modular forms are nonzero for $g=2$ when $N\geq 11$ and $N\neq 12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $q$-series invariants of 3-manifolds $\hat{Z}_b$ defined by Gukov--Pei--Putrov--Vafa using techniques from the theory of normal surface singularities such as splice diagrams. This provides a link between algebraic geometry with quantum topology. We show that the (suitably normalized) sum of all $\hat{Z}_b$ depends only on the splice diagram, and in particular, it agrees for manifolds with the same universal Abelian cover. Using these ideas we find simple formulas for $\hat{Z}_b$ invariants of Seifert manifolds that resemble equivariant Poincar\'e series of corresponding quasihomogeneous singularity. Applications include a better understanding of the vanishing of the $q$-series $\hat{Z}_b$.</description>

      <title>Poset polytopes and pipe dreams: types C and B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of this paper concerns type C. We present new explicitly defined families of algebro-combinatorial structures of three kinds: combinatorial bases in representations, Newton--Okounkov bodies of flag varieties and toric degenerations of flag varieties. All three families are parametrized by the same family of polytopes: the marked chain-order polytopes of Fang and Fourier which interpolate between the type C Gelfand--Tsetlin and FFLV polytopes. Thus, in each case the obtained structures interpolate between the well-known bases, Newton--Okounkov bodies or degenerations associated with the latter two polytopes. We then obtain similar results for type B after introducing a new family of poset polytopes to be considered in place of marked chain-order polytopes. In both types our constructions and proofs rely crucially on a combinatorial connection between poset polytopes and pipe dreams.</description>

Abstract: Given a finite set $S$ of distinct primes, we propose a method to construct polylogarithmic motivic Chabauty-Kim functions for $\mathbb{P}^1 \setminus \{ 0,1,\infty \}$ using resultants. For a prime $p\not\in S$, the vanishing loci of the images of such functions under the $p$-adic period map contain the solutions of the $S$-unit equation. In the case $\vert S\vert=2$, we explicitly construct a non-trivial motivic Chabauty-Kim function in depth 6 of degree 18, and prove that there do not exist any other Chabauty-Kim functions with smaller depth and degree. The method, inspired by work of Dan-Cohen and the first author, enhances the geometric step algorithm developed by Corwin and Dan-Cohen, providing a more efficient approach.</description>

      <title>Chow functions for partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three decades ago, Stanley and Brenti initiated the study of the Kazhdan--Lusztig--Stanley (KLS) functions, putting on common ground several polynomials appearing in algebraic combinatorics, discrete geometry, and representation theory. In the present paper we develop a theory that parallels the KLS theory. To each kernel in a given poset, we associate a polynomial function that we call the \emph{Chow function}. The Chow function often exhibits remarkable properties, and sometimes encodes the graded dimensions of a cohomology or Chow ring. The framework of Chow functions provides natural polynomial analogs of graded module decompositions that appear in algebraic geometry, but that work for arbitrary posets, even when no graded module decomposition is known to exist. In this general framework, we prove a number of unimodality and positivity results without relying on versions of the Hard Lefschetz theorem. Our framework shows that there is an unexpected relation between positivity and real-rootedness conjectures about chains on face lattices of polytopes by Brenti and Welker, Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of matroid Chow rings by Ferroni and Schr\"oter, and flag enumerations on Bruhat intervals of Coxeter groups by Billera and Brenti.</description>
