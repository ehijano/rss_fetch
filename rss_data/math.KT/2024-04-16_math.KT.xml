      <title>Link patterns and elliptic Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the following three families of geometric objects: Schubert varieties in flag manifolds, matrix Schubert varieties, and Borel orbits of 2-nilpotent matrices. The first family is governed by permutations, the second by partial permutations, and the last one by "link patterns". These geometric objects admit characteristic classes in equivariant elliptic cohomology obtained within the framework created by Borisov and Libgober. We construct a Hecke-type algebra for computing elliptic classes and extend its action to include partial permutations and linking patterns. A uniform point of view facilitates a better understanding of duality.</description>

      <title>ku-theoretic spectral decompositions for spheres and projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh described a conjectural extension of the geometric Satake equivalence to spherical varieties, whose spectral decomposition is described by Hamiltonian varieties. The goal of this article is to study their conjecture, especially in the case of spherical varieties of relative rank 1, using tools from homotopy theory. Our discussion relates their conjecture to classical topics in homotopy theory such as the EHP sequence and Hopf fibrations, as well as more modern topics such as Hochschild (co)homology. We will also study an analogue of the derived geometric Satake equivalence and of the Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh conjecture with coefficients in connective complex K-theory. In this generalized setting, the dual group (a la Langlands, Gaitsgory--Nadler, Sakellaridis--Venkatesh, Knop--Schalke) remains unchanged, but the specific dual "representation" of the dual group changes. On the spectral/Langlands dual side, we expect that the appropriate replacement of Hamiltonian varieties are given by what we term "ku-Hamiltonian varieties"; this is a notion interpolating between Hamiltonian and quasi-Hamiltonian varieties (a la Alekseev--Malkin--Meinrenken). Finally, we suggest possible generalizations to more exotic cohomology theories such as complex cobordism.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>
