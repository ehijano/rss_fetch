      <title>Planet formation in chemically diverse and evolving discs -- I. Composition of planetary building blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary discs are dynamic environments where the interplay between chemical processes and mass transport shapes the composition of gas and dust available for planet formation. We investigate the combined effects of volatile chemistry - including both gas-phase and surface reactions - viscous gas evolution, and radial dust drift on the composition of planetary building blocks. We explore scenarios of chemical inheritance and reset under varying ionisation conditions and for various dust grain sizes in the sub-mm regime. We simulate disc evolution using a semi-analytical 1D model that integrates chemical kinetics with gas and dust transport, accounting for viscous heating, turbulent mixing, and refractory organic carbon erosion. We find that mass transport plays a role in the chemical evolution of even sub-micron grains, especially in discs that have experienced strong heating or are exposed to relatively high levels of ionising radiation. The radial drift of relatively small icy grains can yield significant volatile enrichment in the gas phase within the snowlines, increasing the abundances of key species by up to an order of magnitude. Early planetesimal formation can lead to volatile depletion in the inner disc on timescales shorter than 0.5 Myr, while the erosion of refractory organic carbon can lead to markedly superstellar gas-phase C/O and C/N ratios. Notably, none of the analysed scenarios reproduce the monotonic radial trend of the gas-phase C/O ratio predicted by early models. Our results also show that a pairwise comparison of elemental ratios, in the context of the host star's composition, is key to isolating signatures of different scenarios in specific regions of the disc. We conclude that models of planet formation must concurrently account for the chemical and dynamical evolution of discs, as well as the diversity of their initial chemical and physical conditions.</description>

      <title>A High Geometric Albedo for LTT9779b Points Towards a Metal-rich Atmosphere and Silicate Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: In this work, we aim to confirm the high albedo of the benchmark ultrahot Neptune LTT9779b using 20 secondary eclipse measurements of the planet observed with CHEOPS. In addition, we perform a search for variability in the reflected light intensity of the planet as a function of time. Methods: First, we used the TESS follow-up data of LTT9779b from three sectors (2, 29, and 69) to remodel the transit signature and estimate an updated set of transit and ephemeris parameters, which were directly used in the modeling of the secondary eclipse lightcurves. This involved a critical noise-treatment algorithm, including sophisticated techniques such as wavelet denoising and Gaussian Process (GP) regression, to constrain noise levels from various sources. In addition to using the officially released reduced aperture photometry data from CHEOPS DRP, we also reduced the raw data using an independent PSF photometry pipeline, known as PIPE, to verify the robustness of our analysis. The extracted secondary eclipse lightcurves were modeled using the PYCHEOPS package, where we have detrended the background noise correlated with the spacecraft roll angle, originating from the inhomogeneous and asymmetric shape of the CHEOPS point spread function, using an N-order glint function. Results: Our independent lightcurve analyses have resulted in consistent estimations of the eclipse depths, with values of 89.9$\pm$13.7 ppm for the DRP analysis and 85.2$\pm$13.1 ppm from PIPE, indicating a high degree of statistical agreement. Adopting the DRP value yields a highly constrained geometric albedo of 0.73$\pm$0.11. No significant eclipse depth variability is detected down to a level of $\sim$37 ppm. Conclusions: Our results confirm that LTT9779b exhibits a strikingly high optical albedo, which substantially reduces the internal energy budget of the planet compared to more opaque...</description>

      <title>Advanced Modeling for Exoplanet Detection and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit, such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Planetary Obliquity Excitation Through Pre-Main Sequence Stellar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planet's axial tilt ("obliquity") substantially affects its atmosphere and habitability. It is thus essential to comprehend the various mechanisms that can excite planetary obliquities, particularly at the primordial stage. Here, we explore planetary obliquity excitation induced by the early evolution of the host star. A young, distended star spins rapidly, resulting in a large gravitational quadrupole moment that induces nodal recession of the planet's orbit. As the star contracts and spins down, the nodal recession frequency decreases and can cross the planet's spin axis precession frequency. An adiabatic encounter results in the planet's capture into a secular spin-orbit resonance and excites the obliquity to large values. We find planets within $a \lesssim 1 \ \mathrm{AU}$ are most affected, but adiabatic capture depends on the initial stellar radius and spin rate. The overall picture is complicated by other sources of perturbation, including the disk, multiple planets, and tidal dissipation. Tides make it such that stellar oblateness-induced obliquity excitation is transient since tidal perturbations cause the resonance to break once high obliquities are reached. However, this early transient excitation is important because it can prime planets for long-term capture in a secular spin-orbit resonance induced by planet-planet interactions. Thus, although stellar oblateness-induced resonances are short-lived, they facilitate the prevalence of long-lived non-zero obliquities in exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: TOI-7149~b an Inflated Giant Planet causing a 12% Transit of a Fully Convective M-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the discovery and characterization of TOI-7149~b, a 0.705 $\pm$ 0.075 $M_J$, 1.18 $\pm$ 0.045 $R_J$ gas giant on a $\sim 2.65$ day period orbit transiting an M4V star with a mass of 0.344 $\pm$ 0.030~$M_{\odot}$ and an effective temperature of 3363 $\pm$ 59 K. The planet was first discovered using NASA's TESS mission, which we confirmed using a combination of ground-based photometry, radial velocities, and speckle imaging. The planet has one of the deepest transits of all known main-sequence planet hosts at $\sim$ 12\% ($R_p/R_\star\sim 0.33$). Pushing the bounds of previous discoveries of Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS), TOI-7149 is one of the lowest mass M-dwarfs to host a transiting giant planet. We compare the sample of transiting GEMS with a 200~pc Gaia colour magnitude diagram (CMD) and find that the GEMS hosts are likely to be high metallicity stars. We also analyze the sample of transiting giant planets using the non-parametric \texttt{MRExo} framework to compare the bulk density of warm Jupiters across stellar masses. We confirm our previous result that transiting Jupiters around early M-dwarfs have similar masses and densities to warm Jupiters around FGK stars, and extend this to mid M-dwarfs, thereby suggesting a potential commonality in their formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Statistical Analysis of Exoplanet Habitability: Detection Bias and Earth Analog Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multivariate statistical analysis of 517 exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to identify potentially habitable worlds and quantify detection bias in current surveys. Using eight key parameters (planetary radius, equilibrium temperature, insolation flux, density, and stellar effective temperature, radius, mass, metallicity), we developed a classification framework that successfully identifies Earth as an "Excellent Candidate" for habitability. Our analysis reveals that only 0.6% (3 planets including Earth) meet all habitability criteria under relaxed thresholds, while 75.0% exhibit "Good Star, Poor Planet" characteristics, indicating significant observational bias toward unsuitable planetary systems. Hotelling's T2 test demonstrates that potentially habitable planets are statistically significantly different from the general exoplanet population (p = 0.015). Mahalanobis distance analysis places Earth in the 69.4th percentile for statistical unusualness, confirming that Earth-like planets are genuine outliers in parameter space. We identify Kepler-22 b as a compelling Earth analog with remarkable parameter similarity, and reveal that 1.2% of planets represent "edge cases" orbiting M-dwarf stars with suitable planetary but marginal stellar conditions. These findings demonstrate systematic detection bias in exoplanet surveys and provide quantitative evidence for the rarity of Earth-like worlds while identifying high-priority targets for atmospheric characterization with JWST.</description>

      <title>Semiconvection unlocks dynamo action in stably-stratified regions of gaseous planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stably-stratified fluid layers are ubiquitous in gaseous planets, stellar and liquid cores, and have previously been thought not to be capable of driving a dynamo. We demonstrate that semiconvection (convection driven by a destabilising thermal gradient in an overall stably stratified region) can actually lead to dynamo action in such regions. Motivated by recent works suggesting that significant regions of Jupiter and Saturn may be prone to semiconvection, we conduct direct numerical simulations in spherical shells in the planetary relevant limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers. We retrieve key characteristics of planetary magnetic fields, including dipolarity, magnetic field strength, and the form of the energy spectrum. This short demonstration opens the possibility for further more detailed studies of semiconvection dynamos, that can also be relevant for stellar interiors.</description>

      <title>TOI-1846b: A super-Earth in the radius valley orbiting a nearby M dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and validation of a super-Earth planet orbiting the M dwarf star TOI-1846 (TIC 198385543). The host star(Kmag = 9.6)is located 47 pc away and has a radius of Rs=0.41+/-0.01R_Sun,a mass of Ms=0.40+/-0.02M_Sun and an effective temperature of Teff=3568+/-44K. Our analyses are based on joint modelling of TESS photometry and ground-based multi-color photometric data. We also use high-resolution imaging and archival images, as well as statistical validation techniques to support the planetary system nature. We find that TOI-1846b is a super-Earth sized planet with radius of Rp=1.79+/-0.07R_Earth and a predicted mass of Mp=4.4+1.6-1.0M_Earth (from the Chen &amp; Kipping relation) on a 3.9 d orbit, with an equilibrium temperature of Teq=589+/-20K (assuming a null Bond Albedo) and an incident flux of Sp=17.6+/-2.0S_Earth. Based on the two RV measurements obtained with the TRES spectrograph and high-resolution imaging, a non-planetary transiting companion is excluded. With a radius of ~1.8R_Earth, TOI-1846b is within the sparsely populated radius range around 2R_Earth known as the radius gap (or radius valley). This discovery can contribute to refining the precise location of the radius valley for small planets orbiting bright M dwarfs, thereby enhancing our understanding of planetary formation and evolution processes.</description>

      <title>On quasi-periodic decameter radio emission from Jupiter related to Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses the possibility of implementing a plasma generation mechanism in a source of decameter radio emission associated with Ganymede and an explanation based on this mechanism of forming quasi-periodic sequences of bursts of this radiation. According to the discussed model, the registered quasi-periodic sequences of radiation pulses are a consequence of implementing in the source a pulsating mode of plasma wave conversion into extraordinary electromagnetic waves with a small refractive index. The negative frequency drift of the radiation observed in the frequency-time spectrogram is due to the group delay of waves with a small refractive index and the dispersion of the medium. Based on the plasma model, estimates of the plasma parameters in the generation region are obtained, which are in agreement with the data obtained as a result of satellite measurements.</description>

      <title>Spectral trends across the rings and inner moons of Uranus and Neptune from JWST NIRCam images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST NIRCam images provide low-resolution spectra of the rings and inner moons orbiting Uranus and Neptune. These data reveal systematic variations in spectral parameters like the strength of the strong OH absorption band around 3 microns and the spectral slopes at continuum wavelengths. Neptune's rings show an extremely weak 3-micron band, which is likely due to the small particle sizes in these dusty rings. Neptune's small inner moons also have weaker 3-micron bands and redder continua than Uranus' small inner moons, indicating that Neptune's moons have a lower water-ice fraction. There are also clear spectral trends across the inner Uranian system. The strength of the 3-micron band clearly increases with distance from Uranus, with the rings having a noticeably weaker 3-micron band than most of the small inner moons, which have a weaker 3-micron band than the larger moons like Miranda. While the rings and most of the small moons have neutral spectra between 1.4 microns and 2.1 microns, the outermost small moon Mab exhibits a blue spectral slope comparable to Miranda, indicating that Mab's surface may also be relatively water-ice rich. The next moon interior to Mab, Puck, exhibits a stronger 3-micron band and bluer continuum slope than any of the moons orbiting interior to it, perhaps indicating that it is being covered by water-ice-rich material derived from Mab via the mu ring. Finally, the small moon Rosalind has a redder spectral slope than its neighbors, possibly due to being coated with material from the dusty nu ring.</description>

      <title>The influence of interior structure and thermal state on impact melt generation upon large impacts onto terrestrial planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the melt production of planetary impacts as a function of planet size ($R/R_\mathrm{Earth}$=0.1-1.5), impactor size ($L$=1-1000 km), and core size ratio ($R_\mathrm{core}/R$=0.2-0.8) using a combination of parameterized convection models and fully dynamical 2D impact simulations. To this end, we introduce a new method to determine impact-induced melt volumes which we normalize by the impactor volume for better comparability. We find that this normalized melt production, or melting efficiency, is enhanced for large planets when struck by smaller impactors, while for small planets, melting efficiency is elevated when impacted by larger impactors. This diverging behavior can be explained by the thickness of the planets' thermal boundary layer and the shapes of their thermal and lithostatic pressure profiles. We also find that melting efficiency maxima are usually highest on Earth-size planets. We show that the melting efficiency is only affected by core size ratio for large cores and older planets, where melt production is decreased significantly compared to smaller core size ratios. Projecting the lunar impactor flux on the generic planets, we find that Moon-sized planets produce the most melt throughout their evolution, relative to planet volume. Contrary to previous scaling laws, our method accounts for melt production by decompression or plastic work in addition to shock melting. We find that traditional scaling laws underestimate melt production on length scales where variations in the target planets' lithology, temperature, and lithostatic pressure become significant. We propose empirical formulas to predict melt generation as a function of radial structure and thermal age.</description>

      <title>A 3D model simulation of hydrogen chloride photochemistry on Mars: Comparison with satellite data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HCl was detected in the Martian atmosphere by the NOMAD and ACS spectrometers aboard the ExoMars TGO. Photochemical models show that using gas-phase chemistry alone is insufficient to reproduce these data. Recent work has developed a heterogeneous chemical network within a 1D photochemistry model, guided by the seasonal variability in HCl. The aim of this work is to show that incorporating heterogeneous chlorine chemistry into a global 3D model of Martian photochemistry with conventional gas-phase chemistry can reproduce spatial and temporal changes in hydrogen chloride on Mars. We incorporated this heterogeneous chlorine scheme into the MPCM to model chlorine photochemistry during MYs 34 and 35. These two years provide contrasting dust scenarios, with MY 34 featuring a global dust storm. We also examined correlations in the model results between HCl and other key atmospheric quantities, as well as production and loss processes, to understand the impact of different factors driving changes in HCl. We find that this 3D model of Martian is consistent with the changes in HCl observed by ACS in MY 34 and MY 35, including detections and 70% of non-detections. For the remaining 30%, model HCl is higher than the ACS detection limit due to biases associated with water vapour, dust, or water ice content at these locations. As with previous 1D model calculations, we find that heterogeneous chemistry is required to describe the loss of HCl, resulting in a lifetime of a few sols that is consistent with the observed seasonal variation in HCl. As a result of this proposed chemistry, modelled HCl is correlated with water vapour, airborne dust, and temperature, and anticorrelated with water ice. Our work shows that this chemical scheme enables the reproduction of aphelion detections in MY 35.</description>

      <title>A complete census of planet-hosting binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the effect binarity can have on planet-formation is of crucial importance, as almost half of field stars reside in multiple systems. One effective way to assess this effect is to get an accurate picture of the population of planet-hosting binaries and compare its characteristics to that of field star binaries. We construct an extensive database, collected from intensive literature exploration, to achieve a complete census of all planet-hosting binaries known to date. Despite the heterogeneous character of the different surveys this database is built on, and the biases and selection effects that unavoidably affect any sample of planet-hosting binaries, we look for statistically significant trends and correlations within our sample. Our database provides the characteristics for 759 systems (among which 31 circumbinaries), which is an increase by a factor of 9 with respect to the previous complete census of planet-hosting binaries. Of the 728 S-type systems, 651 are binaries, 73 are triples and 4 are quadruples. The raw distribution of planet-hosting binary separations peaks around 500\,au instead of 50\,au for field binaries. By analyzing the distribution of on-sky angular separations as a function of distance $d_b$ to the systems we argue that the observed deficit of planet-hosting close-in binaries cannot be explained solely by observational biases. Likewise, by exploring how multiplicity fractions among planet-hosts vary with $d_b$ we suggest that the subsample of known planet-hosting binaries at $&lt;500\,$pc is not bias-dominated (but not bias-free). In this $&lt;500\,$pc domain, the multiplicity fraction of planet-hosting stars is $\sim22.5\%$, approximately half of the value for field stars, and the deficit of planet-hosting binaries extends to separations of $\sim500\,$au, giving an approximate estimate of the detrimental effect binarity has on planet-formation</description>

      <title>Analytical transit light curves for power-law limb darkening: a comprehensive framework via fractional calculus and differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete analytical framework for computing exoplanetary transit light curves with arbitrary power-law limb darkening profiles $I(\mu) \propto \mu^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ can be any real number greater than $-1/2$, including the physically important non-integer cases. While the groundbreaking work of Agol et al. (2020) provided exact analytical solutions for polynomial limb darkening through recursion relations, stellar atmosphere models often favor power-law forms with fractional exponents (particularly $\alpha = 1/2$) that remained analytically intractable until now. We solve this fundamental limitation through two complementary mathematical approaches: (1) Riemann-Liouville fractional calculus operators that naturally handle non-integer powers through exact integral representations, and (2) a continuous differential equation framework that generalizes discrete polynomial recursions to arbitrary real exponents. Our method provides exact analytical expressions for all half-integer powers ($\alpha = k/2$) essential for 4-term limb darkening law by Claret (2000), maintains machine precision even at geometric contact points where numerical methods fail, and preserves the computational speed advantages crucial for parameter fitting. We demonstrate that the square-root limb darkening ($\alpha = 1/2$) favored by recent stellar atmosphere studies can now be computed analytically with the same efficiency as traditional quadratic models, achieving 10--100$\times$ speed improvements over numerical integration while providing exact analytical derivatives.</description>

      <title>Dark matter signatures in cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes an 11-year cosmic ray dataset of positrons and antiprotons for planetary dependencies related to gravitationally focused dark matter streams. By projecting event timestamps onto planetary heliocentric longitudes, structured flux modulations are found. The results resemble previously reported planetary relationships in solar and terrestrial observables. This supports the possibility that streaming dark matter particles are focused toward Earth by solar system bodies, including the Moon. The findings suggest further searches using other cosmic ray channels, including existing very high-energy gamma ray data.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of a mission to Sedna -- Nuclear propulsion and advanced solar sailing concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the outer reaches of the Solar System presents significant propulsion and mission design challenges. This study assesses the feasibility of a mission to Sedna using two advanced propulsion concepts: the Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) rocket engine, based on D-$^{3}$He thermonuclear fusion, and a solar sail utilizing thermal desorption of its coating for propulsion. Both are evaluated for a one-way Earth-to-Sedna mission; however, due to the different performances the DFD would enable orbit insertion, whereas for the solar sail a flyby is envisioned. The analysis evaluates key mission parameters, including delivered payload capacity, travel time, and potential science return. For the DFD, we assume a 1.6 MW system with constant thrust and specific impulse, while for the solar sail, we consider acceleration via thermal desorption and a gravity-assist maneuver around Jupiter. The mission analysis incorporates four key phases: departure, interplanetary acceleration, interplanetary coasting, and rendezvous. Sedna is expected to pass through the perihelion of its orbit in 2075--2076 and then move again away from the Sun. Considering the distances involved, a mission targeting the object would need to be launched "relatively" soon, especially if using conventional propulsion systems, which could require up to 30 years of deep-space travel. In our study, results indicate that the DFD could reach Sedna in approximately 10 years, with 1.5 years of thrusting, while the solar sail, assisted by Jupiter's gravity, could complete the journey in 7 years. The feasibility of science payload accommodation, power availability, and communication constraints is also considered. These findings provide a comparative foundation for future deep-space mission planning.</description>

      <title>Survey-Wide Asteroid Discovery with a High-Performance Computing Enabled Non-Linear Digital Tracking Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys detect asteroids by linking together their appearances across multiple images taken over time. This approach faces limitations in detecting faint asteroids and handling the computational complexity of trajectory linking. We present a novel method that adapts ``digital tracking" - traditionally used for short-term linear asteroid motion across images - to work with large-scale synoptic surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin/LSST). Our approach combines hundreds of sparse observations of individual asteroids across their non-linear orbital paths to enhance detection sensitivity by several magnitudes. To address the computational challenges of processing massive data sets and dense orbital phase spaces, we developed a specialized high-performance computing architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments that take advantage of the extensive computational resources at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This work enables the detection of significantly fainter asteroids in existing and future survey data, potentially increasing the observable asteroid population by orders of magnitude across different orbital families, from near-Earth objects (NEOs) to Kuiper belt objects (KBOs).</description>

      <title>Linear Thermal Instability of a Condensing Gas-Particle Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of a hot saturated gas coexisting with condensed particles in an optically thin medium. Such a situation may obtain downstream of a shock, at condensation fronts, or in vaporizing impacts. We show that the gas-particle mixture is subject to a thermal instability whereby a region of lower temperature and higher condensate density cools faster to condense faster. If the region of runaway condensation has a sound-crossing time shorter than its cooling time, then it accretes more mass, in gas and particles, from its higher pressure surroundings. Numerical integration of the linearized perturbation equations demonstrates that this radiation-condensation instability can create particle clumps and voids out of a secularly cooling gas. Provided radiation can escape to cool particle overdensities, thermal instability can help assemble chondrite parent bodies out of the vaporized debris of asteroid collisions, and form planetesimals generally.</description>

      <title>CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) IV: New planetary systems around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 and an update on HD 121056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With around 200 detections of exoplanets around giant stars to date, our knowledge of the population of exoplanets orbiting evolved hosts more massive than the Sun remains limited. The CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) was launched in 2006 with the aim of improving our understanding of the demographics of exoplanets around intermediate-mass stars, by studying them once they have evolved off the main sequence. We intend to refine the current sample of known exoplanets orbiting intermediate-mass (1.5 - 5 M$_\odot$) giant stars of spectral types G and early K. We searched for exoplanets orbiting the four stars HD 87816, HD 94890, HD 102888, and HD 121056. We used data obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph, mounted on the Leonhard Euler Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory in Chile. We gathered high-precision radial-velocity measurements over more than ten years for each of the aforementioned targets. We started by performing a search for periodic signals in the radial-velocity time series of the four targets by using periodograms. Following this, we fit for a Keplerian model using the significant peak with the highest power of the periodogram as the starting guess for the period. We then subtracted this model and repeated the procedure iteratively on the residuals until no significant peaks were found. Finally, to explore the posterior distribution of our models, the final solution was determined using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We report the discovery of five new massive planets around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 as well as the presence of a distant, potentially substellar, companion around HD 102888. We confirm the presence of a previously announced exoplanet orbiting the HD 121056 multi-object system with a period of 89 days and propose an update to the period of the outer companion.</description>
