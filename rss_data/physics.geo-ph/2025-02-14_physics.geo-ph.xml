      <title>Glacier data assimilation on an Arctic glacier: Learning from large ensemble twin experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glacier modeling is crucial for quantifying the evolution of cryospheric processes. At the same time, uncertainties hamper process understanding and predictive accuracy. Here, we suggest improving glacier mass balance simulations for the Kongsvegen glacier in Svalbard through the application of Bayesian data assimilation techniques in a set of large ensemble twin experiments. Noisy synthetic observations of albedo and snow depth, generated using the multilayer CryoGrid community model with a full energy balance, are assimilated using two ensemble-based data assimilation schemes: the particle batch smoother and the ensemble smoother. A comprehensive evaluation exercise demonstrates that the joint assimilation of albedo and snow depth improves the simulation skill by up to 86% relative to the prior in specific glacier regions. The particle batch smoother excels in representing albedo dynamics, while the ensemble smoother is particularly effective for snow depth under low snowfall conditions. By combining the strengths of both observations, the joint assimilation achieves improved mass balance simulations across different glacier zones using either assimilation scheme. This work underscores the potential of ensemble-based data assimilation methods for refining glacier models by offering a robust framework to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce uncertainties in cryospheric simulations. Further advances in glacier data assimilation will be critical to better understanding the fate and role of Arctic glaciers in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Correlation based modeling of the ionospheric magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterns of the magnetic signature of ionospheric currents, generated from an empirical model based on satellite observations, are used to build a statistical correlation based model for ionospheric fields. In order to stabilize the dynamics and to take into account the dominant role of the sun, the fields are represented in solar magnetic coordinates. The covariance structure is analyzed and a second order process that approximates the full dynamics is generated. We show that for synthetic data observations located at the Earth observatories, the full ionospheric field pattern as observed on the earth surface can be reconstructed with good precision. As a proof of principle we provide a first application to the inversion based on real observatory data.</description>

      <title>A unified model of feed rotation in radio telescopes and GNSS antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a model that accounts for the phase rotation that occurs when a receiver or transmitter changes orientation while observing or emitting circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. This model extends work detailing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) carrier phase wind-up to allow us to describe the interaction of changing satellite orientation with phase rotation in observing radio telescopes. This development is motivated by, and a critical requirement of, unifying GNSS and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements at the observation level. The model can be used for either stationary choke ring antennas or steerable radio telescopes observing either natural radio sources or satellites. Simulations and experimental data are used to validate the model and to illustrate its importance. In addition, we rigorously lay out the feed rotation correction for radio telescopes with beam waveguide and full Nasmyth focuses and validate the correction by observing the effect with dual polarization observations. Using this feed rotation model for beam waveguide telescopes, we produce the first phase delay solution for the VLBI baseline WARK30M-WARK12M. We provide a practical guide to using the feed rotation model in Appendix D.</description>

      <title>GlobalTomo: A global dataset for physics-ML seismic wavefield modeling and FWI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global seismic tomography, taking advantage of seismic waves from natural earthquakes, provides essential insights into the earth's internal dynamics. Advanced Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) techniques, whose aim is to meticulously interpret every detail in seismograms, confront formidable computational demands in forward modeling and adjoint simulations on a global scale. Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) offer a transformative potential for accelerating the computational efficiency of FWI and extending its applicability to larger scales. This work presents the first 3D global synthetic dataset tailored for seismic wavefield modeling and full-waveform tomography, referred to as the GlobalTomo dataset. This dataset is uniquely comprehensive, incorporating explicit wave physics and robust geophysical parameterization at realistic global scales, generated through state-of-the-art forward simulations optimized for 3D global wavefield calculations. Through extensive analysis and the establishment of ML baselines, we illustrate that ML approaches are particularly suitable for global FWI, overcoming its limitations with rapid forward modeling and flexible inversion strategies. This work represents a cross-disciplinary effort to enhance our understanding of the earth's interior through physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Leveraging spurious Omori-Utsu relation in the nearest-neighbor declustering method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static and dynamic stress changes in the Earth's crust induced by an earthquake typically trigger other earthquakes. Identifying such aftershocks is an important step in seismic hazard assessment but has remained challenging, especially in cases involving natural fluid migration or anthropogenic fluid injections, which can occur with varying time scales and/or episodically, leading to strong temporal variations in earthquake occurrences. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that earthquake catalogs without triggering can lead to spurious Omori-Utsu and productivity relations for the commonly used nearest-neighbor declustering method. However, we show that the robustness of the Omori-Utsu exponent on newly introduced parameters of the method allows one to determine whether indeed aftershocks are present. For a natural swarm catalog, which lacks a clear distinction between triggered and background events, we find that the catalog is dominated by aftershocks.</description>
