      <title>Attosecond pulses from a solid driven by a synthesized two-color field at megahertz repetition rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing coherent quantum dynamics in light-matter interactions at the microscopic level requires high-repetition-rate isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs) in pump-probe experiments. To date, the generation of IAPs has been mainly limited to the kilohertz regime. In this work, we experimentally achieve attosecond control of extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) high harmonics in the wide-bandgap dielectric MgO, driven by a synthesized field of two femtosecond pulses at 800nm and 2000nm with relative phase stability. The resulting quasi-continuous harmonic plateau with ~ 9 eV spectral width centered around 16.5 eV photon energy can be tuned by the two-color phase and supports the generation of an IAP (~ 730 attoseconds), confirmed by numerical simulation based on three-band semiconductor Bloch equations. Leveraging the high-repetition-rate driver laser and the moderate intensity requirements of solid-state high-harmonic generation, we achieve IAP production at an unprecedented megahertz repetition rate, paving the way for all-solid compact XUV sources for IAP generation.</description>

      <title>A scaling law in optomechanically induced nonlinear oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable limit cycle as a stabilized mechanical oscillation is the primary result of the dynamical evolution of an optomechanical system under sufficiently powerful pump. Because this dynamical process is highly nonlinear, it was not clear whether there exists a quantitative law to relate an evolved mechanical oscillation (the limit cycle of the dynamical process) to the given parameters of the fabricated system. Here, by means of the numerical simulations based on nonlinear dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of such quantitative relations that are generally valid to the nonlinear optomechanical processes. These quantitative relations can be summarized to a scaling law that is seemingly similar to those in phase transitions of many-body systems but has very different properties. Such a quantitative law enables one to find the more feasible system parameters for realizing the same or a similar dynamical evolution result, so it will be useful to the relevant experimental researches.</description>

      <title>Goos-H\"anchen effect singularities in transdimensional plasmonic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify and classify topologically protected singularities for the reflection coefficient of transdimensional plasmonic systems. Originating from nonlocal electromagnetic response due to vertical electron confinement in the system, such singularities lead to lateral (angular) Goos-H\"anchen shifts on the millimeter (milliradian) scale in the visible range, greatly exceeding those reported previously for artificially designed metasurfaces, offering new opportunities for quantum material development.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Frequency Combs and Pulse Generation based on Single Section Interband Cascade Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interband Cascade Lasers (ICLs) are semiconductor lasers emitting in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR 3-6 {\mu}m) and can operate as frequency combs (FCs). These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio-frequency operation. Here we show that ICLs FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at {\lambda} ~ 4.2 {\mu}m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified SWIFT spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free-running operation. Further, we show that, through active modelocking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (~100ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.</description>

      <title>Silicon modulator exceeding 110 GHz using tunable time-frequency equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon modulators have garnered considerable attention owing to their potential applications in high-density integration and high-speed modulation. However, they are increasingly challenged by the limited 3 dB bandwidth as the demand for modulation speed in optical communications continues to rise, impeding their ability to compete with modulators made of thin-film lithium niobate. This bandwidth limitation arises because of the parasitic resistance and capacitance in the PN junction of the silicon modulators. This study demonstrates the first silicon modulator exceeding 110 GHz without any resonant structure using a tunable time-frequency equalization technique. This substantial breakthrough enables on-off keying modulation at a rate of 140 Gbaud without digital signal processing. These accomplishments represent the highest bandwidth and maximum baud rate achieved without digital signal processing in an all-silicon modulator, reaching the testing limitations of the experimental system. This opens the possibility of attaining modulation rates of up to 200 or even 300 Gbaud by adopting design strategies such as slow light and technologies such as digital signal processing. This advancement extends the speed capabilities of silicon modulators to the level of thin-film lithium niobate modulators, thereby promoting their application in the broader array of fields, such as linear-drive pluggable transceivers.</description>

      <title>Collecting single photons from a cavity-coupled quantum dot using an adiabatic tapered fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate efficient in-plane optical fiber collection of single photon emission from quantum dots embedded in photonic crystal cavities. This was achieved via adiabatic coupling between a tapered optical fiber and a tapered on-chip photonic waveguide coupled to the photonic crystal cavity. The collection efficiency of a dot in a photonic crystal cavity was measured to be 5 times greater via the tapered optical fiber compared to collection by a microscope objective lens above the cavity. The single photon source was also characterized by second order photon correlations measurements giving g(2)(0)=0.17 under non-resonant excitation. Numerical calculations demonstrate that the collection efficiency could be further increased by improving the dot-cavity coupling and by increasing the overlap length of the tapered fiber with the on-chip waveguide. An adiabatic coupling of near unity is predicted for an overlap length of 5 microns.</description>

      <title>Influence of Spatial Dispersion in the Topological Edge States of Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Chern insulators are two-dimensional periodic structures that support unidirectional edge states at the boundary, while the wave propagation in the bulk regions is forbidden. The number of unidirectional edge states is governed by the gap Chern number, a topological invariant that depends on the global properties of the system over the entire wavevector space. This concept can also be extended to systems with a continuous translational symmetry provided they satisfy a regularization condition for large wavenumbers. Here, we discuss how the spatial dispersion, notably the high-spatial frequency behavior of the material response, critically influences the topological properties, and consequently, the net number of unidirectional edge states. In particular, we show that seemingly small perturbations of a local magnetized plasma can lead to distinct Chern phases and, consequently, markedly different edge state dispersions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid plasmonic nanoantennas using corner reflectors for enhanced single-photon emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission rate of atom-like photon sources can be significantly improved by coupling them to plasmonic resonant nanostructures. These arrangements function as nanoantennas, serving the dual purpose of enhancing light-matter interactions and decoupling the emitted photons. However, there is a contradiction between the requirements for these two tasks. A small resonator volume is necessary for maximizing interaction efficiency, while a large antenna mode volume is essential to achieve high emission directivity. In this work, we analyze a hybrid structure composed of a noble metal plasmonic resonant nanoparticle coupled to the atom-like emitter, designed to enhance the emission rate, alongside a corner reflector aimed at optimizing the angular distribution of the emitted photons. A comprehensive numerical study of silver and gold corner reflector nanoantennas, employing the finite-difference time-domain method, is presented. The results demonstrate that a well-designed corner reflector can significantly enhance photon emission directivity while also substantially boosting the emission rate.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic photonic resonator with $10^{-17}$/s drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal noise is the predominant instability in the provision of ultrastable laser frequency, referencing to an optical cavity. Reducing the thermal-noise limit of a cavity means either making it larger to spread thermal fluctuations, reducing the sensitivity of the cavity to temperature, or lowering the temperature. We report on a compact photonic resonator made of solid fused silica that we cool in a cryogenic environment. We explore a null in the resonator frequency sensitivity due to the balance of thermal expansion and thermo-optic coefficients at a temperature of 9.5 K, enabling laser stabilization with a long-term frequency drift of 4 mHz/s on the 195 THz carrier. The robustness of fused silica to cryogenics, the capability for photonic design to mitigate thermal noise and drift, and operation at a modest 9.5 K temperature offer unique options for ultrastable laser systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Propagator for Partially Coherent Wave Fields in the Spatial Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of wave fields and their interactions with matter are important for established and emerging fields in optical sciences. Efficient methods for predicting such behaviour have been employed routinely for coherent sources. However, most real world optical systems exhibit partial coherence, for which the present mathematical description involves high dimensional complex functions and hence poses challenges for numerical implementations. This demands significant computational resources to determine the properties of partially coherent wavefields. Here, we describe the novel Phase-Space (PS) propagator, an efficient and self-consistent technique for free space propagation of wave fields which are partially coherent in the spatial domain. The PS propagator makes use of the fact that the propagation of a wave field in free space is equivalent to a shearing of the corresponding PSD function. Computationally, this approach is simpler and the need for using different propagation methods for near and far-field regions is removed.</description>

      <title>Giant non-reciprocity and gyration through modulation-induced Hatano-Nelson coupling in integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric energy exchange interactions, also known as Hatano-Nelson type couplings, enable the study of non-Hermitian physics and associated phenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points (EP). Since these interactions are by definition non-reciprocal, there have been very few options for real-space implementations in integrated photonics. In this work, we show that real-space asymmetric couplings are readily achievable in integrated photonic systems through time-domain dynamic modulation. We experimentally study this concept using a two-resonator photonic molecule produced in a lithium niobate on insulator platform that is electro-optically modulated by rf stimuli. We demonstrate the dynamic tuning of the Hatano-Nelson coupling between the resonators, surpassing the asymmetry that has been achieved in previous work, to reach an EP for the first time. We are additionally able to flip the relative sign of the couplings for opposite directions by going past the EP. Using this capability, we show that the through-chain transport can be configured to exhibit both giant (60 dB) optical contrast as well as photonic gyration or non-reciprocal pi phase contrast.</description>

      <title>Biaxial Gaussian Beams, Hermite-Gaussian Beams, and Laguerre-Gaussian Vortex Beams in Isotropy-Broken Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the paraxial approximation for electromagnetic fields in arbitrary isotropy-broken media in terms of the ray-wave tilt and the curvature of materials Fresnel wave surfaces. We obtain solutions of the paraxial equation in the form of biaxial Gaussian beams, which is a novel class of electromagnetic field distributions in generic isotropy-broken materials. Such beams have been previously observed experimentally and numerically in hyperbolic metamaterials but evaded theoretical analysis in the literature up to now. The biaxial Gaussian beams have two axes: one in the direction of Abraham momentum, corresponding to the ray propagation, and another in the direction of Minkowski momentum, corresponding to the wave propagation, in agreement with the recent theory of refraction, ray-wave tilt, and hidden momentum [Durach, 2024, Ref. 1]. We show that the curvature of the wavefronts in the biaxial Gaussian beams correspond to the curvature of the Fresnel wave surface at the central wave vector of the beam. We obtain the higher-order modes of the biaxial beams, including the biaxial Hermite-Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beams, which opens avenues toward studies of optical angular momentum (OAM) in isotropy-broken media, including generic anisotropic and bianisotropic materials.</description>

      <title>Angle multifunctional dichroism in metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate metasurfaces with strong polarization dichroism that depends on the angle of incidence. We present original designs obtained through topology optimization that selectively transmit specific linear or circular polarizations at different incident angles, while the orthogonal polarization transmission is suppressed. The designed metasurfaces exceed 95% transmission efficiency and 50x extinction ratio within the target angle ranges. The experimental characterization of fabricated metasurfaces confirms the desired operation with 90% transmission efficiency and 10x extinction ratio. These results provide important insights to non-local and k-space engineering of metasurface response and results reveal new opportunities for future multi-functional and angle-selective polarization devices that can find applications in specialized optical instruments and end-user devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced TM-Mode 3D Coupled Wave Theory for Photonic Crystal Surface-Emitting Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose and develop an enhanced three-dimensional coupled wave theory (3D CWT) to investigate the optical field behavior in photonic crystal surface-emitting terahertz quantum cascade lasers (THz-QCLs). By incorporating an effective permittivity enhancement (EP) model and a self-consistent iteration (SCI) method, we successfully address the numerical dispersion issues encountered in analytical methods when dealing with metallic waveguide structures. The results demonstrate that the EP and SCI-enhanced 3D TM mode CWT achieves computational accuracy comparable to traditional numerical simulation methods such as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), while significantly reducing the required computational resources, including time and memory, to just tens of minutes. Moreover, this method provides a clear physical insight, revealing the reasons behind the current low extraction efficiency in surface-emitting THz-QCLs. Our study showcases the potential of the EP and SCI-enhanced 3D CWT as a powerful simulation tool in the research of photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers, offering a new theoretical foundation and optimization direction for future laser designs.</description>

      <title>Coupling single-molecules to DNA-based optical antennas with position and orientation control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical antennas have been extensively employed to manipulate the photophysical properties of single photon emitters. Coupling between an emitter and a given resonant mode of an optical antenna depends mainly on three parameters: spectral overlap, relative distance, and relative orientation between the emitter's transition dipole moment and the antenna. While the first two have been already extensively demonstrated, achieving full coupling control remains unexplored due to the challenges in manipulating at the same time both the position and orientation of single molecules. Here, we use the DNA origami technique to assemble a dimer optical antenna and position a single fluorescent molecule at the antenna gap with controlled orientation, predominately parallel or perpendicular to the antenna's main axis. We study the coupling for both conditions through fluorescence measurements correlated with scanning electron microscopy images, revealing a 5-fold higher average fluorescence intensity when the emitter is aligned with the antenna's main axis and a maximum fluorescence enhancement of ~ 1400-fold. A comparison to realistic numerical simulations suggests that the observed distribution of fluorescence enhancement arises from small variations in emitter orientation and gap size. This work establishes DNA origami as a versatile platform to fully control the coupling between emitters and optical antennas, trailblazing the way for self-assembled nanophotonic devices with optimized and more homogenous performance.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Theory of Wavefront Shaping to Focus Waves inside Disordered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the {theory of focusing waves} to a predefined spatial point {inside} a disordered {three-dimensional medium} by the external shaping of {$N$} different field sources outside the medium, {also known as wavefront shaping}. We {derive} the energy density of the wave field {both} near the focal point and anywhere else inside the medium, {averaged over realizations\textit{ after} focusing}. {To this end, we conceive of a point source at the focal point that emits waves to a detector array that - by time reversal - emits the desired shaped fields. }%endcolor {It appears that the energy} density is formally equal to intensity speckle described by {the so-called} $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$ and even $C_0$ {correlations} in mesoscopic transport theory, {yet the density also obeys a diffusion equation}. The $C_1$ {correlations} describes the focusing in the random medium very well, but do not generate a new source of energy that {is conceived} at the focal point. A source emerges {only} when the $C_2$ speckle is incorporated. The role of $C_0$ speckle, describing fluctuations in the {local density of optical states (LDOS)} is also investigated, {but hardly plays a role in the focusing. } Finally, we use the {concept of an energy source inside the medium} to model the {well-known} optimized transmission by a slab using wavefront shaping.</description>

      <title>Localization of Hybridized Surface Plasmon Modes on Random Gold Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assemblies of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) support hybridized modes of localized surface plasmons (LSPs), which delocalize in geometrically well-ordered arrangements. Here, the hybridization behavior of LSPs in geometrically completely disordered arrangements of Au NPs fabricated by an e-beam synthesis method is studied. Employing electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope in combination with numerical simulations, the disorder-driven spatial and spectral localization of the coupled LSP modes that depend on the NP thickness is revealed. Below 0.4 nm sample thickness (flat NPs), localization increases towards higher hybridized LSP mode energies. In comparison, above 10 nm thickness, a decrease of localization (an increase of delocalization) with higher mode energies is observed. In the intermediate thickness regime, a transition of the energy dependence of the localization between the two limiting cases, exhibiting a transition mode energy with minimal localization, is observed. This behavior is mainly driven by the energy and thickness dependence of the polarizability of the individual NPs.</description>

      <title>Dispersion effects in thermal emission from temporal metamaterials: High-frequency cut-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest breakthroughs in time-varying photonics are fueling novel thermal emission phenomena, for example, showing that the dynamic amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations, induced by the time-modulation of material properties, enables a mechanism to surpass the black-body spectrum. So far, this issue has only been investigated under the assumption of non-dispersive time-modulations. In this work, we identify the existence of a non-physical diverging behavior in the time-modulated emission spectra at high frequencies, and prove that it is actually attributed to the simplistic assumption of a non-dispersive (temporally local) response of the time-modulation associated with memory-less systems. Accordingly, we upgrade the theoretical formalism by introducing a dispersive response function, showing that it leads to a high-frequency cut-off, thereby eliminating the divergence and hence allowing for the proper computation of the emission spectra of time-modulated materials.</description>

      <title>Fully Programmable Spatial Photonic Ising Machine by Focal Plane Division</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines are an emerging class of hardware that promises ultrafast and energy-efficient solutions to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) exploit optical computing in free space to accelerate the computation, showcasing parallelism, scalability, and low power consumption. However, current SPIMs can implement only a restricted class of problems. This partial programmability is a critical limitation that hampers their benchmark. Achieving full programmability of the device while preserving its scalability is an open challenge. Here, we report a fully programmable SPIM achieved through a novel operation method based on the division of the focal plane. In our scheme, a general Ising problem is decomposed into a set of Mattis Hamiltonians, whose energies are simultaneously computed optically by measuring the intensity on different regions of the camera sensor. Exploiting this concept, we experimentally demonstrate the computation with high success probability of ground-state solutions of up to 32-spin Ising models on unweighted maximum cut graphs with and without ferromagnetic bias. Simulations of the hardware prove a favorable scaling of the accuracy with the number of spins. Our fully programmable SPIM enables the implementation of many quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, further establishing SPIMs as a leading paradigm in non von Neumann hardware.</description>

      <title>Compact laser system delivering 2-\mu m few-cycle pulses for strong-field experiments at 200 kHz repetition rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser pulses in the near-infrared spectral range with a high repetition rate and high pulse energy offer the possibility to perform strong-field experiments such as high-order harmonic generation in gases or strong-field photoemission from the surfaces of nanostructures. Here, we present a compact laser system that delivers ultrashort pulses with a duration of less than 20 fs in the spectral range around 2 $\mu$m and with a pulse energy of up to 30 $\mu$J. The 200-kHz system consists of a commercial turnkey pump laser followed by three home-built frequency conversion/parametric amplification stages. We find an excellent pulse energy stability of 0.19 % measured over 2000 consecutive pulses averaged over 5 minutes for the output pulses of the conceptually simple and passively carrier-envelope phase stable system. An outlook on strong-field experiments performed with the laser system is given.</description>

      <title>Effects of localized laser-induced heating in the photoluminescence of silicon-vacancy color centers in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) color centers in 4H-SiC are optically accessible through their zero-phonon line (ZPL) photoluminescence (PL), which is sensitive to the sample temperature. We report the effects of localized laser-induced heating in 4H-SiC by measuring the PL spectra of $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ color centers. The effects of laser-induced heating manifest as the decrease in the peak height, redshift, and broadening of the ZPLs in the PL spectrum. The local temperature in the sample can be determined from the center energy of the ZPLs by using the Varshni equation. The sample temperature can be modeled as a system in contact with a thermal reservoir while being heated by a laser beam. This work highlights the importance of considering laser-induced heating in the optical properties of color centers in 4H-SiC and their potential applications. The result also suggests that the sharp and bright ZPLs of color centers can be used as local temperature probes in 4H-SiC devices.</description>

      <title>An Optical Method for Evaluating the Mechanical Properties of Wires Under Impact Tensile Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic properties of materials utilized in architecture or engineering applications can significantly affect their performance under dynamic or impact loading conditions. To evaluate such behavior, force transducers are commonly employed in testing. However, the calibration of force transducers is typically limited to static conditions and relies solely on gravitational forces exerted on standard masses. Thus, assessing the uncertainty in force measurements using force transducers during dynamic loading conditions remains a challenging task, presenting a significant obstacle in accurately characterizing the dynamic behavior of materials. In this work, an optical technique to evaluate the mechanical properties of wires subjected to impact tensile loads is presented. The wire under test is subjected to an impact tensile load by applying the inertial force of a rigid mass, which is supported by utilizing an aerostatic linear bearing with sufficiently small friction. The inertial force applied to the wire can be determined by multiplying the mass of the rigid mass by its acceleration, where the acceleration can be measured employing a Michelson type optical interferometer. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments and analysis of the dynamic characteristics of a tungsten wire under impact tensile loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic High-order Harmonic Beam Directionality Modulation by Pre-plasma Density Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of a tunable pre-pulse is a common technique to enhance the high-order harmonic generation from surface plasma. The dynamic and structure of a pre-plasma is influenced by the intensity of ionization, heating, and expansion. Time delay between the pre-pulse and the main pulse serves as a crucial parameter for controlling the distribution of the pre-plasma density. The variation in harmonic emission directionality due to the density shape is investigated. Particle-in-cell simulations suggest that both plasma hydrodynamics and geometrical optical effect induces the deflection of harmonic beam from specular reflection. This research contributes to advancing the understanding of laser-plasma interaction conditions, which is important for the detection and optimizing of harmonic source performance.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity adjustable in-line high-temperature sensor based on metal microwire optical Fabry-Perot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) has been widely investigated as a potential temperature sensor. To function as a temperature sensor, the cavity of the FPI is typically constructed from either silica fibers or polymers. The silica cavity FPIs can function at temperatures exceeding 1000{\deg}C. However, its temperature sensitivity is constrained by its relatively low thermal optical coefficient and thermal expansion of silica materials. Although the polymer cavity FPI exhibits a high temperature sensitivity, its cavity is susceptible to deterioration in high-temperature environments. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve high-sensitivity temperature sensing in a high-temperature environment, we propose a new type of temperature FPI sensor by inserting and sealing a section of Cr20Ni80 metal microwire inside a section of silica hollow core fiber (HCF) spliced to standard single-mode fiber (SMF). The FPIs exhibit a high degree of temperature sensitivity due to the high thermal expansion of the Cr20Ni80 metal microwire. Since the Cr20Ni80 metal has a high melting temperature of 1400{\deg}C, such FPIs can function in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of this FPI can be modified without affecting its reflection spectrum by changing the length of the metallic microwire situated within the hollow core fiber. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FPIs exhibit a temperature sensitivity of greater than -0.35nm/{\deg}C within the temperature range of 50{\deg}C to 440{\deg}C. Our proposed metal microwire-based FPIs are economical, robust, simple to fabricate, and capable of functioning in high-temperature environments, rendering them appealing options for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. Especially, we introduce a bracket transformation that makes the calculation of high-order correction drives feasible. We apply our method to engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1927, during the fifth Solvay Conference, Einstein and Bohr described a double-slit interferometer with a "movable slit" that can detect the momentum recoil of one photon. Here, we report a faithful realization of the Einstein-Bohr interferometer using a single atom in an optical tweezer, cooled to the motional ground state in three dimensions. The single atom has an intrinsic momentum uncertainty comparable to a single photon, which serves as a movable slit obeying the minimum Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The atom's momentum wavefunction is dynamically tunable by the tweezer laser power, which enables observation of an interferometric visibility reduction at a shallower trap, demonstrating the quantum nature of this interferometer. We further identify classical noise due to atom heating and precession, illustrating a quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of phonon angular momentum through hybridization with magnons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality, the breaking of improper rotational symmetry, is a fundamental concept spanning diverse scientific domains. In condensed matter physics, chiral phonons, originating from circular atomic motions that carry angular momentum, have sparked intense interest due to their coupling to magnetic degrees of freedom, enabling potential phonon-controlled spintronics. However, modes and their counter-rotating counterparts are typically degenerate at the Brillouin zone center. Selective excitation of a single-handed circulating phonon requires external stimuli that break the degeneracy. Whether energetically nondegenerate circularly polarized phonons can appear spontaneously without structural or external symmetry breaking remains an open question. Here, we demonstrate that nondegenerate elliptically polarized phonon pairs can be induced by coupling to magnons with same helicity in the van der Waals antiferromagnet $\mathrm{FePSe_3}$. We confirm the presence of magnon-phonon hybrids, also known as magnon polarons, which exhibit inherent elliptical polarization with opposite helicities and distinct energies. This nondegeneracy enables their coherent excitation with linearly polarized terahertz pulses, which also endows these rotating modes with chirality. By tuning the polarization of the terahertz drive and measuring phase-resolved polarimetry of the resulting coherent oscillations, we determine the ellipticity and map the trajectory of these hybrid quasiparticles. Our findings establish a general approach to search for intrinsically nondegenerate phonons with angular momentum at the center of the Brillouin zone and introduce a new methodology for characterizing their ellipticity, outlining a roadmap towards chiral-phonon-controlled spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>How to realize compact and Anderson-like localized states in disorder-free hypercube bosonic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to engineer various zero-energy localized states on disorder-free hypercube graphs. Previous works have already indicated that disorder is not essential for observing localization phenomena in noninteracting systems, with some prominent examples including the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model, characterized solely by incommensurate potentials, or 2D incommensurate Moir\'e lattices, which exhibit localization due to the flat band spectrum. Moreover, flat band systems with translational invariance can also possess so-called compact localized states, characterized by exactly zero amplitude outside a finite region of the lattice. Here we show that both compact and non-compact (i.e., Anderson-like) localized states can be observed on disorder-free hypercubes that can be constructed in a standard iterative manner via Cartan products. This construction also makes these localized states robust against perturbations. We illustrate and visualize our results on the example of an $8$D hypercube projected on its Petrie polygon. Our findings can be readily tested on existing photonic experimental setups, where hypercube graphs studied can be emulated by bosonic networks of coupled optical cavities and/or waveguides, thus offering potential advancements in the development of various information and wave manipulation protocols.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Integrating them with an optical cavity enables fast nondestructive qubit readout and access to fast remote entanglement generation for quantum networking. Here, we introduce a platform for coupling single atoms in optical tweezers to a Fabry-Perot Fiber Cavity. Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrate fast qubit state readout with 99.960$^{+14}_{-24}\%$ fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we use cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)$\%$ fidelity and a 32(1)$\%$ success rate. Second, we perform a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)$\%$, increased to 76(2)$\%$ with error detection. The new capabilities enabled by this platform pave the way towards modular quantum computing and networking.</description>

      <title>Integrated magneto-photonic non-volatile multi-bit memory</title>

Abstract: We present an integrated magneto-photonic device for all-optical switching of non-volatile multi-bit spintronic memory. The bits are based on stand-alone magneto-tunnel junctions which are perpendicularly magnetized with all-optically switchable free layers, coupled onto photonic crystal nanobeam cavities on an indium phosphide based platform. This device enables switching of the magnetization state of the bits by locally increasing the power absorption of light at resonance with the cavity. We design an add/drop network of cavities to grant random access to multiple bits via a wavelength-division multiplexing scheme. Based on a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method, we numerically illustrate a compact device capable of switching and accessing 8 bits in different cavities with a 5 nm wavelength spacing in the conventional (C) telecommunication band. Our multi-bit device holds promise as a new paradigm for developing an ultrafast photonically-addressable spintronic memory and may also empower novel opportunities for photonically-driven spintronic-based neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Electro-optic Resonant Phase Shifting for Multi-dimensional, Ultra-dynamic Photonic Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton super-resolution imaging via virtual structured illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging in thick biological tissues is often degraded by sample-induced aberrations, which reduce image quality and resolution, particularly in super-resolution techniques. While hardware-based adaptive optics, which correct aberrations using wavefront shaping devices, provide an effective solution, their complexity and cost limit accessibility. Computational methods offer simpler alternatives but struggle with complex aberrations due to the incoherent nature of fluorescence. Here, we present a deep-tissue super-resolution imaging framework that addresses these challenges with minimal hardware modification. By replacing the photodetector in a standard laser-scanning microscope with a camera, we measure an incoherent response matrix (IRM). A dual deconvolution algorithm is developed to decompose the IRM into excitation and emission optical transfer functions and the object spectrum. The proposed method simultaneously corrects excitation and emission point-spread functions (PSFs), achieving a resolution of {\lambda}/4, comparable to structured illumination microscopy. Unlike existing computational methods that rely on vector decomposition of a single convoluted PSF, our matrix-based approach enhances image reconstruction, particularly for high spatial frequency components, enabling super-resolution even in the presence of complex aberrations. We validated this framework with two-photon super-resolution imaging, achieving a lateral resolution of 130 nanometers at a depth of 180 micrometers in thick mouse brain tissue.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser written waveguides in sapphire for visible light delivery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising solution for scalable integrated optics of trapped-ion quantum processors are curved waveguides guiding visible light within sapphire bulk material. To the best of our knowledge, no curved waveguides were investigated in sapphire so far, and no measurements of waveguides with visible light in undoped planar sapphire substrates were reported. Here, we demonstrate femtosecond laser writing of depressed cladding waveguides in sapphire. Laser parameters, such as pulse energy, pulse duration, and repetition rate, as well as waveguide geometry parameters, were optimized to guide 728 nm light. This resulted in single-mode waveguides with a propagation loss of 1.9(3) dB/cm. The investigation of curved waveguides showed a sharp increase in total loss for curvature radii below 15 mm. Our results demonstrate the potential of femtosecond laser writing as a powerful technique for creating integrated optical waveguides in the volume of sapphire substrates. Such waveguides could be a building block for integrated optics in trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Polaritonic Devices</title>

Abstract: Polaritons, arising from the strong coupling between excitons and photons within microcavities, hold promise for optoelectronic and all-optical devices. They have found applications in various domains, including low-threshold lasers and quantum information processing. To realize complex functionalities, non-intuitive designs for polaritonic devices are required. In this contribution, we use finite-difference time-domain simulations of the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, written in a differentiable manner, and combine it with an adjoint formulation. Such a method allows us to use topology optimization to engineer the potential landscape experienced by polariton condensates to tailor its characteristics on demand. The potential directly translates to a blueprint for a functional device, and various fabrication and optical control techniques can experimentally realize it. We inverse-design a selection of polaritonic devices, i.e., a structure that spatially shapes the polaritons into a flat-top distribution, a metalens that focuses a polariton, and a nonlinearly activated isolator. The functionalities are preserved when employing realistic fabrication constraints such as minimum feature size and discretization of the potential. Our results demonstrate the utility of inverse design techniques for polaritonic devices, providing a stepping stone toward future research in optimizing systems with complex light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Waveguide-multiplexed photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using multiport photodetectors</title>

Abstract: The slowing down of Moore's law has driven the development of application-specific processors for deep learning. Analog photonic processors offer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical domain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase information of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations. However, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ wavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited scalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work, we present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the concept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors (PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need for multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further scaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth. A 4 $\times$ 4 circuit fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform is used to perform MVMs in a 3-layer neural network designed for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Furthermore, the performance of large-scale circuits in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for Fashion-MNIST is simulated, resulting in a classification accuracy of 90.53%. This work provides a simplified and scalable approach to photonic MVM, laying a foundation for large-scale and multi-dimensional photonic matrix-matrix multiplication in optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Braids and Higher-order Exceptional Points from the Interplay Between Lossy Defects and Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the perturbation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain by a localized lossy defect leads to higher-order exceptional points (HOEP). Depending on the location of the defect, third- and fourth- order exceptional points (EP3 \&amp; EP4) appear in the space of Hamiltonian parameters. On the one hand, they arise due to the non-Abelian braiding properties of exceptional lines (EL) in parameter space. Namely, the HOEPs lie at intersections of mutually non-commuting ELs. On the other hand, we show that such special intersections happen due to the fact that the delocalization of edge states, induced by the non-Hermitian defect, hybridizes them with defect states. These can then coalesce together into an EP3. When the defect lies at the midpoint of the chain, a special symmetry of the full spectrum can lead to an EP4. In this way, our model illustrates the emergence of interesting non-Abelian topological properties in the multiband structure of non-Hermitian perturbations of topological phases.</description>

      <title>Global calibration of large-scale photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a global calibration approach for large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beamsplitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent exotic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel interactions beyond the four known fundamental forces in nature (electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions), may arise due to "new physics" beyond the standard model, manifesting as a "fifth force". This review is focused on spin-dependent fifth forces mediated by exotic bosons such as spin-0 axions and axionlike particles and spin-1 Z' bosons, dark photons, or paraphotons. Many of these exotic bosons are candidates to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and their interactions may violate fundamental symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions between fermions mediated by the exchange of exotic bosons have been investigated in a variety of experiments, particularly at the low-energy frontier. Experimental methods and tools used to search for exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as atomic comagnetometers, torsion balances, nitrogen-vacancy spin sensors, and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, are described. A complete set of interaction potentials, derived based on quantum field theory with minimal assumptions and characterized in terms of reduced coupling constants, are presented. A comprehensive summary of existing experimental and observational constraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions is given, illustrating the current research landscape and promising directions of further research.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic condensation through interaction-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and opens new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.</description>
