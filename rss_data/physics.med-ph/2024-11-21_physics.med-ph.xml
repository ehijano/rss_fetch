      <title>Flexible and Generic Framework for Complex Nuclear Medicine Scanners using FreeCAD/GDML Workbench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of nuclear imaging scanners is crucial for optimizing detection and imaging processes. While advancements have been made in simplistic, symmetrical modalities, current research is progressing towards more intricate structures, however, the widespread adoption of computer-aided design (CAD) tools for modeling and simulation is still limited. This paper introduces FreeCAD and the GDML Workbench as essential tools for designing and testing complex geometries in nuclear imaging modalities. FreeCAD is a parametric 3D CAD modeler, and GDML is an XML-based language for describing complex geometries in simulations. Their integration streamlines the design and simulation of nuclear medicine scanners, including PET and SPECT scanners. The paper demonstrates their application in creating calibration phantoms and conducting simulations with Geant4, showcasing their precision and versatility in generating sophisticated components for nuclear imaging. The integration of these tools is expected to streamline design processes, enhance efficiency, and facilitate widespread application in the nuclear imaging field.</description>

      <title>Non-unique water and contrast agent solutions in dual-energy CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to study occurrences of non-unique solutions in dual-energy CT (DECT) for objects containing water and a contrast agent. Previous studies of the Jacobian of nonlinear systems identified that a vanishing Jacobian determinant indicates the existence of multiple solutions to the system. Vanishing Jacobian determinants are identified for DECT setups by simulating intensity data for practical thickness ranges of water and contrast agent. Once existence is identified, non-unique solutions are found by simulating scan data and finding intensity contours with that intersect multiple times. With this process non-unique solutions are found for DECT setups scanning iodine and gadolinium, including setups using tube potentials in practical ranges. Non-unique solutions demonstrate a large range of differences and can result in significant discrepancies between recovered and true material mapping.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer for Millimetric Magnetoelectric Biomedical Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniature bioelectronic implants promise revolutionary therapies for cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a significant method for miniaturization, eliminating the need for bulky batteries in devices. Despite successful demonstrations of millimetric battery free implants in animal models, the robustness and efficiency of WPT are known to degrade significantly under misalignment incurred by body movements, respiration, heart beating, and limited control of implant orientation during surgery. This article presents an omnidirectional WPT platform for millimetric bioelectronic implants, employing the emerging magnetoelectric (ME) WPT modality, and magnetic field steering technique based on multiple transmitter (TX) coils. To accurately sense the weak coupling in a miniature implant and adaptively control the multicoil TX array in a closed loop, we develop an active echo (AE) scheme using a tiny coil on the implant. Our prototype comprises a fully integrated 14.2 mm3 implantable stimulator embedding a custom low power system on chip (SoC) powered by an ME film, a TX with a custom three channel AE RX chip, and a multicoil TX array with mutual inductance cancellation. The AE RX achieves negative 161 dBm per Hz input referred noise with 64 dB gain tuning range to reliably sense the AE signal, and offers fast polarity detection for driver control. AE simultaneously enhances the robustness, efficiency, and charging range of ME WPT. Under 90 degree rotation from the ideal position, our omnidirectional WPT system achieves 6.8x higher power transfer efficiency (PTE) than a single coil baseline. The tracking error of AE negligibly degrades the PTE by less than 2 percent from using ideal control.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Virtual Staining of Label-Free Tissue in Imaging Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a powerful tool for untargeted, highly multiplexed molecular mapping of tissue in biomedical research. IMS offers a means of mapping the spatial distributions of molecular species in biological tissue with unparalleled chemical specificity and sensitivity. However, most IMS platforms are not able to achieve microscopy-level spatial resolution and lack cellular morphological contrast, necessitating subsequent histochemical staining, microscopic imaging and advanced image registration steps to enable molecular distributions to be linked to specific tissue features and cell types. Here, we present a virtual histological staining approach that enhances spatial resolution and digitally introduces cellular morphological contrast into mass spectrometry images of label-free human tissue using a diffusion model. Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with Periodic Acid-Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite utilizing IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size. Additionally, our approach employs an optimized noise sampling technique during the diffusion model's inference process to reduce variance in the generated images, yielding reliable and repeatable virtual staining. We believe this virtual staining method will significantly expand the applicability of IMS in life sciences and open new avenues for mass spectrometry-based biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Advanced Plaque Modeling for Atherosclerosis Detection Using Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, plaque formation in human arteries, known as atherosclerosis, is the focus of many research efforts. Previously, molecular communication (MC) models have been proposed to capture and analyze the natural processes inside the human body and to support the development of diagnosis and treatment methods. In the future, synthetic MC networks are envisioned to span the human body as part of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), turning blood vessels into physical communication channels. By observing and characterizing changes in these channels, MC networks could play an active role in detecting diseases like atherosclerosis. In this paper, building on previous preliminary work for simulating an MC scenario in a plaque-obstructed blood vessel, we evaluate different analytical models for non-Newtonian flow and derive associated channel impulse responses (CIRs). Additionally, we add the crucial factor of flow pulsatility to our simulation model and investigate the effect of the systole-diastole cycle on the received particles across the plaque channel. We observe a significant influence of the plaque on the channel in terms of the flow profile and CIR across different emission times in the cycle. These metrics could act as crucial indicators for early non-invasive plaque detection in advanced future MC methods.</description>

      <title>A robust shape model for blood vessels analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of digital twins for the cardiovascular system will enable insightful computational tools both for research and clinical practice. This, however, demands robust and well defined models and methods for the different steps involved in the process. We present a vessel coordinate system (VCS) that enables the unanbiguous definition of locations in a vessel section, by adapting the idea of cylindrical coordinates to the vessel geometry. Using the VCS model, point correspondence can be defined among different samples of a cohort, allowing data transfer, quantitative comparison, shape coregistration or population analysis. Furthermore, the VCS model allows for the generation of specific meshes (e.g. cylindrical grids, ogrids) necessary for an accurate reconstruction of the geometries used in fluid simulations. We provide the technical details for coordinates computation and discuss the assumptions taken to guarantee that they are well defined. The VCS model is tested in a series of applications. We present a robust, low dimensional, patient specific vascular model and use it to study phenotype variability analysis of the thoracic aorta within a cohort of patients. Point correspondence is exploited to build an haemodynamics atlas of the aorta for the same cohort. The atlas originates from fluid simulations (Navier-Stokes with Finite Volume Method) conducted using OpenFOAMv10. We finally present a relevant discussion on the VCS model, which covers its impact in important areas such as shape modeling and computer fluids dynamics (CFD).</description>
