      <title>Existence of Ground State and Excited Spinning $Q$-Vortex Solitons on Finite Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of spinning $Q$-vortex solitons in a complex scalar field theory with a sextic potential on a finite domain. By reducing the governing equation to a nonlinear boundary value problem, we use variational methods to prove the existence of at least two distinct types of solutions: a ground state solution obtained via constrained minimization and an excited state of the saddle-point type obtained via the Mountain Pass Theorem. We derive bounds for the angular frequency $\omega$, the wave amplitude, and the domain size $P$, and provide explicit estimates for the exponential decay of the solutions. Furthermore, we implement a spectral-Galerkin formulation to numerically compute the profiles of fundamental $Q$-vortices, illustrating the saturation behavior of the soliton's amplitude and the asymptotic dependence of the frequency on a prescribed reduced norm and vortex winding number, as well as verifying the theoretical results and visualizing the topological phase structure of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Damping of phonons in Bose gas at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose gas in a large cubic box with periodic boundary conditions interacting with a small potential with a positive Fourier transform. We compute the imaginary part of the phononic excitation spectrum in the lowest order of perturbation theory in thermodynamic limit at low temperatures and low momentum. Our analysis is based on perturbation theory of the standard Liouvillean. We use two approaches: the first, motivated by the standard representation of operator algebras, examines resonances near zero; the second analyzes the 2-point correlation function in the energy-momentum space.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic approximation of tight-binding models near spectral degeneracies and validity for wave packet propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the derivation and validity of macroscopic descriptions of wave packets supported in the vicinity of degenerate points $(K,E)$ in the dispersion relation of tight-binding models accounting for macroscopic variations. We show that such wave packets are well approximated over long times by macroscopic models with varying orders of accuracy. Our main applications are in the analysis of single- and multilayer graphene tight-binding Hamiltonians modeling macroscopic variations such as those generated by shear or twist. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of the Schr\"odinger Operator for the Incommensurate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many novel and unique physical phenomena of incommensurate systems can be illustrated and predicted using the spectra of the associated Schr\"odinger operators. However, the absence of periodicity in these systems poses significant challenges for obtaining the spectral information. In this paper, by embedding the system into higher dimensions together with introducing a regularization technique, we prove that the spectrum of the Schr\"odinger operator for the incommensurate system can be approximated by the spectra of a family of regularized Schr\"odinger operators, which are elliptic, retain periodicity, and enjoy favorable analytic and spectral properties. We also show the existence of Bloch-type solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation for the incommensurate system, which can be well approximated by the Bloch solutions to the equations associated with the regularized operators. Our analysis provides a theoretical support for understanding and computing the incommensurate systems.</description>

Abstract: We determine the isometry group of the $n$-qubit state space with respect to the quantum Wasserstein distance induced by the so-called symmetric transport cost for all $n \in \mathbb{N}.$ It turns out that the isometries are precisely the Wigner symmetries, that is, the unitary or anti-unitary conjugations.</description>

      <title>Conformally flat factorization homology in Ind-Hilbert spaces and Conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a metric-dependent geometric variant of factorization homology in conformally flat Riemannian geometry for $d \geq 2$. We introduce a symmetric monoidal category of germs of d-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and orientation-preserving conformal open embeddings, and its full monoidal subcategory generated by flat disks. A conformally flat $d$-disk algebra is a symmetric monoidal functor from this disk category to a target category; in this paper we take the target to be $\mathrm{IndHilb}$, the ind-category of Hilbert spaces, which provides a mathematical formulation of $d$-dimensional conformal field theories.
  The (1-categorical) left Kan extension of an $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebra defines a metric-dependent invariant of conformally flat manifolds. Under suitable positivity and continuity assumptions, we prove that its value on the standard sphere $(S^d,g_{\mathrm{std}})$ reproduces the sphere partition function of the associated conformal field theory. For $d&gt;2$, we construct nontrivial $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebras from unitary representations of $\mathrm{SO}^+(d,1)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Riemannian Cubics with Obstacle Avoidance for Quantum Geometric Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric model predictive control framework for quantum systems subject to smoothness and state constraints. By formulating quantum state evolution intrinsically on the projective Hilbert space, we penalize covariant accelerations to generate smooth trajectories in the form of Riemannian cubics, while incorporating state-dependent constraints through potential functions. A structure-preserving variational discretization enables receding-horizon implementation, and a Lyapunov-type stability result is established for the closed-loop system. The approach is illustrated on the Bloch sphere for a two-level quantum system, providing a viable pathway toward predictive feedback control of constrained quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>The effects of boundary conditions on Rindler's spectral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rindler's metric is an interesting way to incorporate a set of uniformly accelerated observers into space-time coordinates; this is consistent with special and general relativity. It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect. Interestingly, its Galilean limit already shows the appearance of quantized modes for particles in free space, given by Airy functions. This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer. A detailed interpretation of the transition amplitudes is given in connection with particle production obtained from a Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

      <title>Topological fundamental groups of locally finite infinite configuration spaces and infinite braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological fundamental groups of the locally finite infinite ordered configuration space \(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C)\) in the plane and the homotopy quotient of $Conf^{lf}_\infty$ by the canonical action of the infinite permutation group $\Aut(\N)$: \[ H^{lf}(\infty):=\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C),\widetilde{\N}), \qquad B^{lf}(\infty):=\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}\!\bigl(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C)\!/\!/\Aut(\N),[e_0,\widetilde{\N}]\bigr). \] We prove that \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) and \(B^{lf}(\infty)\) are non-discrete and complete topological groups. A main structural theorem identifies \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) with a canonical locally finite inverse-limit model built from finite pure braid groups, and we construct a complete left-invariant ultrametric compatible with the quotient topology from the loop space of $\Conf$. The direct limit of finite pure braid groups admits a dense embedding into \(H^{lf}(\infty)\), and we show that \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) is the Ra\u{\i}kov completion of this subgroup. Moreover, the direct limit of finite braid groups embeds into \(B^{lf}(\infty)\) and is dense in the finitary subgroup \(B^{lf}_{\mathrm{fin}}(\infty)\subseteq B^{lf}(\infty)\).</description>

      <title>Hidden Kinematics and Dual Quantum References in Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin resonance phenomena are conventionally described using transition probabilities formulated in a rotating frame, whose physical meaning implicitly depends on the choice of quantum reference standard. In this Colloquium, we show that a spin in a rotating magnetic field constitutes a configuration involving two quantum descriptions that share a common quantization operator but differ in their kinematic and dynamical roles. The transition probability therefore emerges as a relational quantity between quantum reference standards rather than an intrinsic property of a single evolving spin state. By incorporating the kinematic motion of the spin vector together with the dynamical evolution, this framework restores consistent energy accounting and reveals the dual-reference structure underlying spin dynamics in rotating magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Field conserving adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) scheme on massively parallel adaptive octree meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is widely used to efficiently resolve localized features in time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by selectively refining and coarsening the mesh. However, in long-horizon simulations, repeated intergrid interpolations can introduce systematic drift in conserved quantities, especially for variational discretizations with continuous basis functions. While interpolation from parent-to-child during refinement in continuous Galerkin (CG) discretizations is naturally conservative, the standard injection-based child-to-parent coarsening interpolation is generally not.
  We propose a simple, scalable field-conserving coarsening operator for parallel, octree-based AMR. The method enforces discrete global conservation during coarsening by first computing field conserving coarse-element values at quadrature points and then recovering coarse nodal degrees of freedom via an $L^2$ projection (mass-matrix solve), which simultaneously controls the $L_2$ error. We evaluate the approach on mass-conserving phase-field models, including the Cahn--Hilliard and Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes systems, and compare against injection in terms of conservation error, solution quality, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Minimal nonintegrable models with three-site interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic understanding of integrability breaking in translationally invariant spin chains with genuine three-site interactions remains lacking. In this work, we introduce and classify minimal nonintegrable spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians, defined as models that saturate injectivity while admitting no nontrivial local conserved charges beyond the Hamiltonian. We first rigorously establish the nonintegrability of the deformed Fredkin spin chain with periodic boundary conditions by mapping it to a nearest-neighbor composite-spin representation and excluding all admissible $3$-local conserved charges. Guided by its structure, we then construct five classes of spin-$1/2$ models with genuine three-site interactions. One class is integrable, while the remaining four contain exactly two interaction terms and constitute the minimal nonintegrable three-site models. Our results delineate a sharp boundary between integrability and nonintegrability beyond the nearest-neighbor paradigm.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version that admits an exact recursion for the distribution of left--right crossings, and prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) for all length scales if $d\ge3$. A Gaussian approximation, supported by numerics, predicts that, in the marginal case $d=2$, this scaling acquires a logarithmic correction and that the variance-to-mean ratio of conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ (the ``$2/3$ law'') for all $d\ge2$. We conjecture that both effects persist beyond the hierarchical setting. We finally provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and interpret it as a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching.

      <description>arXiv:2602.08143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical elliptic Toda chain introduced by Krichever and the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain introduced by Adler, Shabat and Suris. It is shown that these models can be obtained as particular cases of the elliptic Ruijsenaars chain. We explain how the classical $r$-matrix structures are derived for these chains. Also, as a by-product, we prove that the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain is gauge equivalent to discrete Landau-Lifshitz model of XYZ type. The elliptic Toda chain is also gauge equivalent to XYZ chain with special values of the Casimir functions at each site.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents for Sparsely Coupled Linear Cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies structured products of real matrices for which the top Lyapunov exponent can be accessed by reducing the dynamics to an amenable generalization of upper triangular matrices. Exploiting prescribed zero patterns (including block-triangularity and sparse decompositions, conveniently encoded by a directed sparsity graph), we obtain explicit, computable bounds and, in favorable cases, formulas for $\gamma_1$ by combining deterministic triangular controls with a suitable refinement of the Furstenberg--Kifer lemma for block-triangular products. The estimates apply both to tempered (possibly deterministic) sequences and to stationary ergodic random cocycles under standard integrability. We also discuss applications to perturbation models for linear systems, including low-rank updates, where the reduction converts the problem to lower-dimensional or scalar cocycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a canonical procedure of extending generalized Dynkin diagrams gives rise to families of Kac-Moody groups that satisfy homological stability. We also briefly sketch some emergent structure that appears on stabilization. Our results are illustrated for the family {E_n} which is of interest in String theory. The techniques used involve homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of Kac-Moody groups.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Properties of the Ideal of Spectral Invariants for the Discrete Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma=q_1\mathbb{Z}\oplus q_2 \mathbb{Z}\oplus\cdots\oplus q_d\mathbb{Z}$, with $q_j\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ for each $j\in \{1,\ldots,d\}$, and denote by $\Delta$ the discrete Laplacian on $\ell^2\left( \mathbb{Z}^d\right)$. We describe various algebraic properties of the ideal of spectral invariants for the discrete Laplacian when $d=1$, including a construction of a Gr\"obner basis. We also present various collections of complex $\Gamma$-periodic potentials $V$ that are such that $\Delta$ and $\Delta + V$ are Floquet isospectral. We end with a discussion of the general setting, where the $q_i$ are taken to be vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our recent approach to the Finkelberg-Kazhdan-Lusztig equivalence theorem centers on the construction of a fiber functor associated with the categories in the equivalence theorem, which in turn explains the underlying algebraic and analytic structure of the corresponding weak Hopf algebra in a new sense. We provide a non-technical and historical overview of the core arguments behind our proof, discuss these structural properties, and its applications to rigidity and unitarizability of braided fusion categories arising from conformal field theory. We conclude proposing some natural directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation in the frequency regime in one-dimensional quasiperiodic media -Limiting absorption principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation with (possibly perturbed) quasiperiodic coefficients. Quasiperiodic functions are the restriction of higher dimensional periodic functions along a certain (irrational) direction. In classical settings, for real-valued frequencies, this equation is generally not well-posed: existence of solutions in L 2 is not guaranteed and uniqueness in L $\infty$ may fail. This is a well-known difficulty of Helmholtz equations, but it has never been addressed in the quasiperiodic case. We tackle this issue by using the limiting absorption principle, which consists in adding some imaginary part (also called absorption) to the frequency in order to make the equation well-posed in L 2 , and then defining the physically relevant solution by making the absorption tend to zero. In previous work, we introduced a definition of the solution of the equation with absorption based on Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) boundary conditions. This approach offers two key advantages: it facilitates the limiting process and has a direct numerical counterpart. In this work, we first explain why the DtN boundary conditions have to be replaced by Robin-to-Robin boundary conditions to make the absorption go to zero. We then prove, under technical assumptions on the frequency, that the limiting absorption principle holds and we propose a numerical method to compute the physical solution.</description>

      <title>Uphill transport in competitive drift-diffusion models with volume exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses uphill transport (defined as a regime in which particle flow is opposite to the prescriptions of Fick's diffusion) in drift-diffusion particle transport constrained by volume exclusion. Firstly, we show that the stationary hydrodynamic limit of a multispecies, weakly asymmetric exclusion process (SHDL) naturally predicts precisely characterized uphill regimes in the space of external drivings.
  Then, with specific reference to systems of oppositely charged particles, we identify well-defined model hypotheses and extensions whereby the SHDL converges to the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, thus bridging the gap between exclusion-based particle models and continuum descriptions commonly used in engineering. The merits and limitations of the models in describing the particle fluxes and predicting uphill transport conditions are investigated in detail with respect to the adopted approximations and simplifications.
  The results demonstrate the persistence of uphill transport phenomena across modeling scales, clarify the conditions under which they occur, and suggest that uphill transport may play a significant role in nanoscale electrolytes, confined ionic and iontronic devices, and membrane-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Structure Preserving Schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Equations with Degenerate Mobility and Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system utilizes a diffusive phase-field for interface tracking of multi-phase fluid flows. Recently structure preserving methods for CHNS have moved into focus to construct numerical schemes that, for example, are mass conservative or obey initial bounds of the phase-field variable. In this work decoupled implicit-explicit formulations based on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methodology are considered and compared to existing schemes from the literature.
  For the fluid flow a standard continuous Galerkin approach is applied. An adaptive conforming grid is utilized to further draw computational focus on the interface regions, while coarser meshes are utilized around pure phases. All presented methods are compared against each other in terms of bound preservation, mass conservation, and energy dissipation for different examples found in the literature, including a classical rising droplet problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Fyodorov and Keating on the supercritical moments of the partition function of the C$\beta$E field or equivalently the supercritical moments of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the C$\beta$E ensemble for general $\beta&gt;0$ and general real moment exponents. Moreover, we give the first expression for all correlation functions of the $\mathsf{Sine}_\beta$ point process for all $\beta&gt;0$. The main object behind both results is the Hua-Pickrell stochastic zeta function introduced by Li and Valk\'{o}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Joyce structure, we show that the associated $\mathbb{C}^*$-family of non-linear connections $\mathcal{A}^{\epsilon}$ can be gauged to a standard form $\mathcal{A}^{\epsilon,\text{st}}$ by a gauge transformation $\hat{g}$, formal in $\epsilon$. We show that the corresponding infinitesimal gauge transformation $\dot{g}=\log(\hat{g})$ has a convergent Borel transform, provided $\dot{g}$ vanishes on the base of the Joyce structure. This establishes the first step in showing that such a $\dot{g}$ is resurgent. We also use $\hat{g}$ to produce formal twistor Darboux coordinates for the complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure associated to the Joyce structure, and show a similar result about convergence of the Borel transform of the formal twistor Darboux coordinates.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for one-dimensional compressible Navier--Stokes system in dynamic combustion with small $BV\cap L^1$ initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the global well-posedness theory of small BV weak solutions to a one-dimensional compressible Navier--Stokes model for reacting gas mixtures in dynamic combustion. The unknowns of the PDE system consist of the specific volume, velocity, temperature, and mass fraction of the reactant. For initial data that are small perturbations around the constant equilibrium state $(1, 0, 1, 0)$ in the $L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap {\rm BV}(\mathbb{R})$-norm, we establish the local-in-time existence of weak solutions via an iterative scheme, show the stability and uniqueness of local weak solutions, and prove the global-in-time existence of solutions for initial data with small BV-norm via an analysis of the Green's function of the linearised system. The large-time behaviour of the global BV weak solutions is also characterised. This work is motivated by and extends the recent global well-posedness theory for BV weak solutions to the one-dimensional isentropic Navier--Stokes and Navier--Stokes--Fourier systems developed in [T.-P. Liu, S.-H. Yu, Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 75 (2022), 223--348] and [H. Wang, S.-H. Yu, X. Zhang, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 245 (2022), 375--477].</description>

      <title>Equilibrium-like statistical mechanics in space-time for a deterministic traffic model far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by earlier numerical evidence for a percolation-like transition in space-time jamming, we present an analytic description of the transient dynamics of the deterministic traffic model elementary cellular automaton rule 184 (ECA184). By exploiting the deterministic structure of the dynamics, we reformulate the problem in terms of a height function constructed directly from the initial condition, and obtain an equilibrium statistical mechanics-like description over the lattice configurations. This formulation allows macroscopic observables in space-time, such as the total jam delay and jam relaxation time, as well as microscopic jam statistics, to be expressed in terms of geometric properties of the height function. We thereby derive the associated scaling forms and recover the critical exponents previously observed in numerical studies. We discuss the physical implications of this space-time geometric approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pair $(K,K')$ consisting of a smooth triangulation $K$ of a compact smooth oriented Riemannian manifold $M$ and a sufficiently fine subdivision $K'$ determines a finite-dimensional Cheeger--Simons model $\mathscr{CS}(K,K')$ built from Whitney-type data on the induced curvilinear complexes. Its associated differential character groups $\Diff^{\bullet}(\mathscr{CS}(K,K'))$ provide a simplicial, finite-dimensional counterpart of the Cheeger--Simons differential characters $\widehat H^{\bullet}(M)$. We prove that every smooth triangulation admits a subdivision $K'$ for which $(K,K')$ is a Cheeger--Simons triangulation in this sense. Under a uniform fullness (shape-regularity) hypothesis, we show that the natural discretization/extension maps between $\widehat H^{k}(M)$ and $\Diff^{k}(\mathscr{CS}(K,K'))$ approximate the identity in a Sobolev-dual seminorm as $\mesh(K')\to 0$. For closed $M$, we further identify $\widehat H^{k}(M)$ canonically with the inverse limit of $\Diff^{k}(\mathscr{CS}(K,K'))$ over refinements. As an application, we formulate a simplicial higher abelian gauge theory whose gauge-invariant configuration space is $\Diff^{p}(\mathscr{CS}(K,K'))$, and we prove that the resulting simplicial (regularized) partition function converges, in the refining limit, to the corresponding smooth regularized partition function of Kelnhofer.</description>

Abstract: We prove that wave operators of scattering theory for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators $H = \Delta^2 + V (x)$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with real potentials $V(x)$ such that $\langle x \rangle^3 V(x) \in L^{\frac43}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and $\langle x \rangle^{10+\varepsilon} V(x) \in L^1 (\mathbb{R}^2)$ for an $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $\langle x \rangle=(1+|x|^2)^{\frac12}$, are bounded in $L^p (\mathbb{R}^2)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ if $H$ is regular at zero in the sense that there are no non-trivial solutions to $(\Delta^2 + V(x))u(x)=0$ such that $\langle x \rangle^{-1} u(x) \in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and if positive eigenvalues are absent from $H$. This reduces $L^p$-mapping properties of functions $f(H)$ of $H$ to those of Fourier multipliers $f(\Delta^2)$.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for the model reduction of multivariate geometric Brownian motions (GBMs), a fundamental class of stochastic processes with broad applications in mathematical finance, population biology, and statistical physics. Our approach leverages the interplay between the method of invariant manifolds and adiabatic elimination to derive closed-form reduced equations for the deterministic drift. An extended formulation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is subsequently employed to characterize the stochastic component of the reduced description. As a concrete application, we apply our reduction scheme to a GBM arising from a two-state quantum system, showing that the reduced dynamics accurately capture the localization properties of the original model while significantly simplifying the analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present direct and elementary commutator techniques for the Dirac equation with long-range electric and mass perturbations. The main results are absence of generalized eigenfunctions and locally uniform resolvent estimates, both in terms of the optimal Besov-type spaces. With an additional massless assumption, we also obtain an algebraic radiation condition of projection type. For their proofs, following the scheme of Ito-Skibsted, we adopt, along with various weight functions, the generator of radial translations as conjugate operator, and avoid any of advanced functional analysis, pseudodifferential calculus, or even reduction to the Schr\"odinger equation. The results of the paper would serve as a foundation for the stationary scattering theory of the Dirac operator.</description>

Abstract: We introduce classical and non-deterministic finite automata associated to representations of the braid group. After briefly reviewing basic definitions on finite automata, Coxeter's groups and the associated word problem, we turn to the Artin presentation of the braid group and its quotients. We present various representations of the braid group as deterministic or non-deterministic finite state automata and discuss connections with $q$-Dicke states, as well as Lusztig and crystal bases. We propose the study of the eigenvalue problem of the $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ invariant spin-chain like ``Hamiltonian'' as a systematic means for constructing canonical bases for irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n).$ This is explicitly proven for the algebra $\mathfrak{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_2).$ Special braid representations associated with self-distributive structures are also studied as finite automata. These finite state automata organize clusters of eigenstates of these braid representations.</description>

      <title>A coupled Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and Level-Set framework for evolving interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) require significantly smaller architectures compared to multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based approaches, while retaining expressive power through spline-based activations. Moving boundary problems are ubiquitous in physical systems, whose numerical solutions are quite complex. We propose a shallow KAN framework combined with a Level-set formulation that directly approximates the temperature distribution $T(\mathbf{x},t)$ and the moving interface $\Gamma(t)$, enforcing the governing PDEs, phase equilibrium, and Stefan condition through physics-informed residuals. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions show that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions of both temperature fields and interface dynamics, highlighting the potential of KANs as a compact and efficient alternative for moving boundary PDEs. First, we validate the model with semi-infinite analytical solutions. Subsequently, the model is extended to 2D using a level-set based formulation for interface propagation, which is solved within the KAN framework. This work demonstrates that KANs are capable of solving complex moving boundary problems without the need for measurement data.</description>

      <title>Exact calculations beyond charge neutrality in timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\alpha_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\sqrt{2},\mu)=e(4\pi\sqrt2 \mu)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\alpha_j=\frac{1}{2}Q+\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature. These results provide the first rigorously controlled family of exact calculations in timelike Liouville theory outside charge neutrality.</description>

      <title>Hawking-type singularity theorems for worldvolume energy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical singularity theorems of R. Penrose and S. Hawking from the 1960s show that, given a pointwise energy condition (and some causality as well as initial assumptions), spacetimes cannot be geodesically complete. Despite their great success, the theorems leave room for physically relevant improvements, especially regarding the classical energy conditions as essentially any quantum field theory necessarily violates them. While singularity theorems with weakened energy conditions exist for worldline integral bounds, so called worldvolume bounds are in some cases more applicable than the worldline ones, such as the case of some massive free fields. In this paper we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a - potentially very negative - global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking type singularity theorem is proven. Finally, we apply the theorem to a cosmological scenario proving past geodesic incompleteness in cases where the worldline theorem was inconclusive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolev extension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential operators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitz domains, and also domains with fractal boundaries. Although our variational formulation does not involve any measures on the boundary, we recover the classical results in smooth domains by considering the surface measure on the boundary. We discuss properties of these operators and generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves substantial speedups over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

      <title>Conditional Stability of the Euler Method on Riemannian Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive nonlinear stability results for numerical integrators on Riemannian manifolds, by imposing conditions on the ODE vector field and the step size that makes the numerical solution non-expansive whenever the exact solution is non-expansive over the same time step. Our model case is a geodesic version of the explicit Euler method. Precise bounds are obtained in the case of Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature. The approach is based on a cocoercivity property of the vector field adapted to manifolds from Euclidean space. It allows us to compare the new results to the corresponding well-known results in flat spaces, and in general we find that a non-zero curvature will deteriorate the stability region of the geodesic Euler method. The step size bounds depend on the distance traveled over a step from the initial point. Numerical examples for spheres and hyperbolic 2-space confirm that the bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>Integral modelling and Reinforcement Learning control of 3D liquid metal coating on a moving substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic coatings are used to enhance the durability of metal surfaces by protecting them from corrosion. These protective layers are typically deposited in a fluid state via a liquid film. Controlling instabilities in the liquid film is crucial to achieving uniform, high-quality coatings. This study explores the possibility of controlling liquid films on a moving substrate using a combination of gas jets and electromagnetic actuators. To model the 3D liquid film, we extend existing integral models to incorporate the effects of electromagnetic actuators. The control strategy was developed within a reinforcement learning framework, in which the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm interacts with the liquid film via pneumatic and electromagnetic actuators to optimise a reward function that accounts for instability-wave amplitude through a trial-and-error process. The PPO identified an optimal control law that reduced interface instabilities via a novel mechanism: gas jets push crests, and electromagnets raise troughs via the Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity: Exact analytic solution for the power-law case $f(Q) = Q + b \: Q^\nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity in order to describe relativistic stars. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q_{0}\left( \frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) ^{\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cosmic evolution within the framework of $f(T)$ gravity using a flat-FRW background and model the universe as consisting of three components: baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. We consider the new agegraphic (NA) as an alternative for dark energy and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) as an alternative for dark matter. After that, first we obtain the Friedman equations and then we obtain the continuity equations in the presence of the interaction term between the dark components of the universe, where the interaction term represents the energy flow from dark matter to dark energy. In what follows, we plot the variation of the cosmological parameters of dark energy in terms of the redshift parameter by using the power-law cosmology. Finally, we investigate the evolution and stability of the universe and report the values of the density parameters of the universe components which confirm the present model with observational data.</description>

Abstract: We show that semi-arithmetic surfaces of arithmetic dimension two which admit a modular embedding have exponential growth of mean multiplicities in their length spectrum. Prior to this work large mean multiplicities were rigorously confirmed only for the length spectra of arithmetic surfaces. We also discuss the relation of the degeneracies in the length spectrum and quantization of the Hamiltonian mechanical system on the surface.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Quantum Code Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to modify the code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and parity checks. Motivations may include concatenating codes, embedding low-density parity check (LDPC) codes into finite-dimensional Euclidean space, or reducing the weights of parity checks. During this embedding, it is essential that the modified code possesses an isomorphic set of logical qubits as the original code. However, despite numerous explicit constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our framework.</description>

      <title>Stern-Gerlach Interferometers with Dual Sensing: Probing Recoherence and Lifecycles of Local Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) addresses the quantum measurement problem by preserving unitary quantum evolution without postulating a many-worlds ontology. Its central concept is the Local Hilbert Space (LHS), an operationally isolated island of coherence within which measurement dynamics are confined. This paper develops BHSI across both experimental and conceptual frontiers. Experimentally, we propose a three-stage dual-sensing Stern-Gerlach interferometer (SGI) designed to probe the fuzzy spatiotemporal boundaries associated with LHS transitions. Stage 1 targets uncommitted timing events, manifested as sensor-detector mismatches; Stage 2 investigates conditional recoherence, a signature distinguishing time-extended local branching from instantaneous collapse or global splitting; and Stage 3 employs controlled electromagnetic phase shifts to discriminate between unitary and retrocausal recoherence mechanisms. Conceptually, we introduce the lifecycle of LHSs, describing how coherent domains emerge, persist, and fragment across physical scales. We ground this ontology in established physical precedents, drawing analogies between fuzzy LHS boundaries and phenomenological bag models in quantum field theory, and between the fragmentation of a primordial global Hilbert space in the early Universe and the fragmentation of Hilbert space in many-body systems. Together, these developments show that BHSI provides a unified, testable description of the transition from quantum inseparability to classical separability within a single physical reality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction and large $N$ study of the continuous two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ through probability, combinatorics and representation theory. In the first part, we define the continuous Yang--Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by L\'evy, then we show in the second part how to derive the character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, L\'evy and Ma\"ida with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large-$N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the incompatibility norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful, versatile toolkit for its application.</description>

      <title>Directionality and quantum backfire in continuous-time quantum walks from delocalized states: Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive analytical results for continuous-time quantum walks from a new class of initial states with tunable delocalization. The dynamics are governed by a Hamiltonian with complex hopping amplitudes. We provide closed-form equations for key observables, revealing three notable findings: (1) the emergence of directed quantum transport from completely unbiased initial conditions; (2) a quantum backfire effect, where greater initial delocalization enhances short-time spreading but counterintuitively induces a comparatively smaller long-time spreading after a crossing time $t_{\mathrm{cross}}$; and (3) an exact characterization of survival probability, showing that the transition to an enhanced $t^{-3}$ decay is a fine-tuned effect. Our work establishes a comprehensive framework for controlling quantum transport through the interplay between intermediate initial delocalization and Hamiltonian phase.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in stabilizer entropy densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution of a measure of non-stabilizerness, also known as magic, is investigated for Haar-random pure quantum states. Focusing on the stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, the associated probability density functions (PDFs) are found to display distinct non-analytic features analogous to Van Hove singularities in condensed matter systems. For a single qubit, the stabilizer purity exhibits a logarithmic divergence at a critical value corresponding to a saddle point on the Bloch sphere. This divergence occurs at the $|H\rangle$-magic states, which hence can be identified as states for which the density of non-stabilizerness in the Hilbert space is infinite. An exact expression for the PDF is derived for the case $\alpha = 2$, with analytical predictions confirmed by numerical simulations. The logarithmic divergence disappears for dimensions $d \ge 3$, in agreement with the behavior of ordinary Van Hove singularities on flat manifolds. In addition, it is shown that, for one qubit, the linear stabilizer entropy is directly related to the partial incompatibility of quantum measurements, one of the defining properties of quantum mechanics, at the basis of Stern-Gerlach experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the Lorentz mirrors model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <title>Localisation with on-shell supersymmetry algebras via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism: Localisation as gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism provides a powerful technique to deal with gauge and global (super)symmetries that may only hold on shell. We argue that, since global (super)symmetries and gauge symmetries appear on an equal footing in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, similarly localisation with respect to global (super)symmetries appears on an equal footing with gauge fixing of gauge symmetries; in general, when the gauge-fixing condition is not invariant under the global symmetries, localisation (with respect to a localising fermion) and gauge fixing (with respect to a gauge-fixing fermion) combine into a single operation. Furthermore, this perspective enables supersymmetric localisation using only on-shell supermultiplets, dispensing with auxiliary fields, extending an insight first discovered by Losev and Lysov arXiv:2312.13999. We provide the first examples of on-shell localisation for quantum field theories (together with a companion paper by Arvanitakis arXiv:2511.00144).</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Black Holes due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of MOTSs due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior MOTS imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. In fact, a very mild incoming radiation can cause a large enough generalized boundary mean curvature of an isotropically large domain so that a MOTS exists in the interior. This is fundamentally different from black hole formation by standard ``gravitational collapse" and can be interpreted as the dynamical realization of a long-suspected idea in GR: MOTS can form because of ``global geometry", not just quasi-local concentration of gravity/matter.</description>

      <title>On regions of mixed unitarity for semigroups of unital quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is established that both discrete and continuous semigroups of unital quantum channels are eventually mixed unitary. This result is novel even for the subclass of Schur maps and stands in sharp contrast to the resolution of the asymptotic quantum Birkhoff conjecture by Haagerup and Musat, who demonstrated that tensor powers of some unital quantum channels maintain a persistent positive distance from the set of mixed unitary channels. Remarkably, our results show that this gap vanishes in finite time when considering ordinary powers within a semigroup.
  Building on this, we define the mixed unitary index of a unital quantum channel as the minimum time (or power) beyond which all subsequent maps become mixed unitary. We demonstrate that for any fixed dimension $d \geq 3$, there is no universal upper bound for this index. Furthermore, we observe that if a continuous semigroup is not mixed unitary at some $t &gt; 0$, it remains non-mixed unitary for all $t$ sufficiently close to the origin. Finally, we investigate quantum dynamical semigroups where mixed unitarity is restricted to specific families, such as Weyl or diagonal unitaries. We show that Schur semigroups of correlation matrices eventually become mixtures of rank-one correlation matrices, and we characterize the generators of Schur semigroups that remain within this set for all $t \geq 0$.</description>

      <title>Subspace Selected Variational Quantum Configuration Interaction with a Partial Walsh Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum system is one of the most promising applications for quantum algorithms. Here we propose a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) \emph{Ansatz} for finding ground state configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions. We map CI for fermions to a quantum circuit using a subspace superposition, then apply diagonal Walsh operators to encode the wavefunction. The algorithm can be used to solve both full CI and selected CI wavefunctions, resuling in exact and near-exact solutions for electronic ground states. Both the subspace selection and wavefunction \emph{Ansatz} can be applied to any Hamiltonian that can be written in a qubit basis. The algorithm bypasses costly classical matrix diagonalizations, which is advantageous for large-scale applications. We demonstrate results for several molecules using quantum simulators and hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a single solution of QYBE (or CYBE) we produce an infinite family of solutions of QYBE (or CYBE) parametrized by transitive arrays and, in particular, by signed permutations. We are especially interested in cases when such solutions yield quasi-triangular structures on direct powers of Lie bialgebras and tensor powers of Hopf algebras. We obtain infinite families of such structures as well and study the corresponding Poisson-Lie structures and co-quasi-triangular algebras.</description>

      <title>The Small-Dispersion Limit of the Intermediate Long Wave Equation via Semiclassical Soliton Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the small dispersion limit of the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation, specifically on a class of well-behaved initial conditions $u_0$ where the number of solitons in the solution increases without bound. First, we conduct a formal WKB-style analysis on the ILW direct scattering problem, generating approximate eigenvalues and norming constants. We then use this to define a modified set of scattering data and rigorously analyze the associated inverse scattering problem. The main results include demonstrating $L^2$-convergence of the solution at $t = 0$ to the original initial condition $u_0$ and for $0 &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{c}$ to the associated solution of invicid Burgers' equation, where $t_\mathrm{c}$ is the time of gradient catastrophe.</description>
