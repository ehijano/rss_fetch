      <title>Multiple binding modes of AKT on PIP$_3$-containing membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is triggered by recruitment of AKT to cellular membranes. Although AKT is a multidomain serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, how these domains cooperate to regulate AKT activation on membranes remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, we identify four distinct membrane-binding modes that differ in the orientations and membrane contacts of the PH and kinase domains. In addition to PIP$_3$ binding to the PH domain, we observe specific PIP$_3$ interactions with basic residues in the kinase domain. In the most stable mode, PIP$_3$ interacts with both the canonical and a secondary binding site in the PH domain, while the kinase domain adopts an orientation in which the activation-loop phosphorylation site is exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the populations of these binding modes depend on the PIP$_3$ concentration in the membrane, leading to changes in the preferred orientation of AKT. These findings shed light on how lipid recognition by the PH domain and the kinase domain of AKT cooperatively shape its membrane-bound conformations.</description>

      <title>Imperfect Turing Patterns: Diffusiophoretic Assembly of Hard Spheres via Reaction-Diffusion Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turing patterns are stationary, wave-like structures that emerge from the nonequilibrium assembly of reactive and diffusive components. While they are foundational in biophysics, their classical formulation relies on a single characteristic length scale that balances reaction and diffusion, making them overly simplistic for describing biological patterns, which often exhibit multi-scale structures, grain-like textures, and inherent imperfections. Here, we integrate diffusiophoretically-assisted assembly of finite-sized cells, driven by a background chemical gradient in a Turing pattern, while also incorporating intercellular interactions. This framework introduces key control parameters, such as the P\'{e}clet number, cell size distribution, and intercellular interactions, enabling us to reproduce strikingly similar structural features observed in natural patterns. We report imperfections, including spatial variations in pattern thickness, packing limits, and pattern breakups. Our model not only deepens our understanding but also opens a new line of inquiry into imperfect Turing patterns that deviate from the classical formulation in significant ways.</description>

      <title>Living Droplets with Mesoscale Swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.</description>
