      <title>Boltzmann Sampling of Frustrated J1 - J2 Ising Models with Programmable Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the surprising, and potentially very useful, capabilities of analog quantum computers, such as D-Wave quantum annealers, is sampling from the Boltzmann, or Gibbs, distribution defined by a classical Hamiltonian. In this study, we thoroughly examine the ability of D-Wave quantum annealers to sample from the Boltzmann distribution defined of a canonical type of competing magnetic frustration $J_1$-$J_2$ model; the ANNNI (axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising) model. Boltzmann sampling error rate is quantified for standard linear-ramp anneals ranging from $5$ nanosecond annealing times up to $2000$ microseconds on two different D-Wave quantum annealing processors. Interestingly, we find some analog hardware parameters which result in a very high accuracy (down to a TVD of $0.0003$) and low temperature sampling (down to $\beta=32.2$) in a frustrated region of the ANNNI model magnetic phase diagram. This bolsters the viability of current analog quantum computers for thermodynamic sampling applications of highly frustrated magnetic spin systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal entanglement transition in chaotic quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA) is one of the most important class of parametrized quantum circuits for near-term applications of quantum computing. We show that the problem of simulating some major classes of the HEA is BQP-complete by explicitly demonstrating that any relevant quantum circuit can be efficiently represented as an HEA circuit of those classes.</description>

      <title>Realistic GKP stabilizer states enable universal quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are inherently noisy as ideal ones would require infinite energy. While this is typically considered as a deficiency to be actively corrected, this work demonstrates that imperfect GKP stabilizer states can be leveraged in order to apply non-Clifford gates using only linear optical elements. In particular, Gaussian operations on normalizable GKP states, combined with homodyne measurements, permit two key primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates in the normalizable GKP codespace, thereby implementing Clifford gates with high fidelity; and probabilistic projection of unmeasured modes onto non-Pauli eigenstates. These results demonstrate that normalizable GKP stabilizer states combined with Gaussian operations provide a practical framework for computational universality within the measurement-based model of quantum computation in a realistic continuous-variable setting.</description>

      <title>Controlled growth of rare-earth-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films on III-V semiconductors for hybrid quantum photonic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough, polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Novel Encodings of Homology, Cohomology, and Characteristic Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) encode a variety of topological invariants in their code space. A classic structure that has not been encoded directly is that of obstruction classes of a fiber bundle, such as the Chern or Euler class. Here, we construct and analyze extensions of toric codes. We then analyze the topological structure of their errors and finally construct a novel code using these errors to encode the obstruction class to a fiber bundle. In so doing, we construct an encoding of characteristic classes such as the Chern and Pontryagin class in topological QECC. An example of the Euler class of $S^2$ is constructed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Techniques for Biomedical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging is emerging as a transformative approach for biomedical applications, applying nonclassical properties of light, such as entanglement, squeezing, and quantum correlations, to overcome fundamental limits of conventional techniques. These methods promise superior spatial resolution, enhanced signal-to-noise ratios, improved phase sensitivity, and reduced radiation dose, for potentially safer and more precise imaging for delicate biological samples. Here, we present an overview of quantum optical biomedical imaging technologies as well as quantum-inspired imaging methods, including quantum optical coherence tomography, quantum optical microscopy, ghost imaging, multi-parameter quantum imaging, and imaging with quantum-grade cameras. We describe the operating principles, biomedical applications, and unique advantages of each approach, along with the specific challenges for their translation into real-life practice. This review aims to guide future research toward advancing quantum imaging from experimental demonstrations to impactful biomedical tools.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry in the trotterized critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrable trotterization provides a method to evolve a continuous time integrable many-body system in discrete time, such that it retains its conserved quantities. Here we explicitly show that the first order trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model is integrable. The discrete time conserved quantities are obtained from an inhomogeneous transfer matrix constructed using the quantum inverse scattering method. The inhomogeneity parameter determines the discrete time step. We then focus on the non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for the trotterized evolution. We find that the discretization of both space and time leads to a doubling of these duality operators. They account for discrete translations in both space and time. As an interesting application, we find that these operators also provide maps between trotterizations of different orders. This helps us extend our results beyond the trotterization scheme and investigate the Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for finite time Floquet evolution of the critical transverse field Ising chain.</description>

      <title>Multi-Directional Periodic Driving of a Two-Level System beyond Floquet Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce an exact expression for the response of a semi-classical two-level quantum system subject to arbitrary periodic driving. Determining the transition probabilities of a two-level system driven by an arbitrary periodic waveform necessitates numerical calculations through methods such as Floquet theory, requiring the truncation of an infinite matrix. However, such truncation can lead to a loss of significant interference information, hindering quantum sensors or introducing artifacts in quantum control. To alleviate this issue, we use the $\star$-resolvent formalism with the path-sum theorem to determine the exact series solution to Schr\"odinger's equation, therefore providing the exact transition probability. The resulting series solution is generated from a compact kernel expression containing all of the information of the periodic drive and then expanded in a non-harmonic Fourier series basis given by the divided difference of complex exponentials with coefficients corresponding to products of generalized Bessel functions. The present method provides an analytical formulation for quantum sensors and control applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction for multiparameter metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For single-parameter sensing, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) probes achieve optimal quantum-enhanced precision across the unknown parameter range, solely relying on parameter-independent separable measurement strategies for all values of the unknown parameter. However, in the multiparameter setting, a single GHZ probe not only fails to achieve quantum advantage but also the corresponding optimal measurement becomes complex and dependent on the unknown parameters. Here, we provide a recipe for multiparameter sensing with GHZ probes using quantum error correction techniques by treating all but one unknown parameters as noise, whose effects can be corrected. This strategy restores the core advantage of single parameter GHZ-based quantum sensing, namely reaching optimally quantum-enhanced precision for all unknown parameter values while keeping the measurements separable and fixed. Specifically, given one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, our protocol extracts optimal possible precision for any probe size. While this optimal precision is shot-noise limited for a single GHZ probe, we recover the Heisenberg scaling through use of multiple complementary GHZ probes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol with Bayesian estimation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous heat flow and quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principle that heat spontaneously flows from higher temperature to lower temperature is a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, often assumed to be independent of the sequence of interactions. While this holds true for macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.</description>

      <title>Unifying contextual advantages in state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state discrimination, alongside its other applications, has recently found use as a tool for witnessing generalised contextuality. In this article, we derive noncontextuality inequalities for both conclusive and inconclusive outcomes across various guessing strategies. For minimum- error discrimination, the advantage is in terms of the confidences of individual outcomes, while for unambiguous state discrimination, it is in terms of the average guessing probability. For maximum- confidence discrimination, we show that contextual advantages occur not only for the confidence but also their average, the guessing probability, as well as the inconclusive outcome rate. Our results unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and figures of merit. We envisage that various quantum information applications based on state discrimination may offer advantages over non-contextual theories.</description>

      <title>Controllable Non-Hermitianity in Continuous-Variable Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure dephasing is the dominant leak mechanism in photonic cat qubits because its phase errors disrupt the parity protection, rendering the qubit vulnerable to energy relaxation. In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing mechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces \textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and odd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the dynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby transforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for probing non-Hermitian physics. Within this platform, we demonstrate the possibility to control the parity-time symmetry phase transition in a single cat qubit by adjusting its amplitude. Moreover, we couple two cat qubits to realize an entanglement phase transition induced by the exceptional point. Our work constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator, overturning the conventional paradigm that treats dephasing as harmful noise.</description>

      <title>Expectation-Realization Interpretation of Quantum Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By comparing Schr\"odinger's cat with its classical counterpart, I show that a quantum superposition should be understood as an expectation over possible eigenstates weighted by wave-like probabilities. Upon the occurrence of a certain event, the quantum system is randomly realized into one of the possible eigenstates due to its intrinsic stochasticity. While the randomness of a single realization cannot be controlled or predicted, the overall distribution can be regulated via experimental setup and converges as the number of events increases. A measurement is indeed an activity employing a certain event to convert a quantum effect into a macroscopic outcome. Consequently, the puzzling concepts of wavefunction collapse, many worlds, and decoherence become unnecessary for understanding quantum superposition. This expectation-realization interpretation, which integrates probability theory with wave mechanics, can also be extended to quantum pathways. Moreover, it reframes tests of Bell's inequalities as validating the wave-like probability nature of quantum mechanics, with no need to invoke the mysterious notions of quantum non-locality and "spooky action at a distance".</description>

      <title>Two-exponential decay of Acridine Orange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we experimentally study the fluorescence decay of Acridine Orange at late times, in order to test whether a late-time power-law behaviour emerges, a feature expected to be very small but consistent with quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical predictions. Using two distinct photon detectors, we find that the data are well described by a sum of two exponential functions with lifetimes $\tau_1 = 1.7331 \pm 0.001$ ns and $\tau_2 = 5.948 \pm 0.012$ ns, in agreement with values reported in the literature. While no deviation from the exponential decay law is observed, this study serves as a reliable test for the experimental setup and enables a precise determination of the sample lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>

Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chip Co-Design for Fidelity and Entanglement Preservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Engineered Robustness for Nonadiabatic Geometric Quantum Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While geometric quantum gates are often theorized to possess intrinsic resilience to control errors by exploiting the global properties of evolution paths, this promise has not consistently translated into practical robustness. We present a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) that incorporates additional auxiliary constraints to suppress dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance. Within this framework, we also design NGQGs using noncyclic paths, offering enhanced design flexibility. Implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, our scheme realizes high-fidelity single-qubit gates that are robust against Rabi amplitude error $\epsilon$, with infidelity scaling as $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ behavior of conventional dynamical gates. We further analyze two-qubit NGQGs under parametric driving. Our results identify subtle limitations that compromise performance in two-qubit scenarios, underscoring the importance of phase compensation and waveform calibration. The demonstrated simplicity and generality of our super-robust NGQG scheme make it applicable across diverse quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Local quantum coherence with intersource interactions at nonzero temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local quantum coherence in a two-level system (TLS) is typically generated via time-dependent driving. However, it can also emerge autonomously from symmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment at a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting atoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating the autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this gap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS coupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the whole system being in thermal equilibrium. We show that the local coherence not only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures of the environment compared to the case of no inter-source interactions. The temperature dependence of the coherence bears signatures of a quantum phase transition, and our analytical results suggest strategies for its optimization. Our findings reveal generic properties of the autonomously generated quantum coherence and point to viable routes for observing the coherence at nonzero temperatures.</description>

      <title>Twirlator: A Pipeline for Analyzing Subgroup Symmetry Effects in Quantum Machine Learning Ansatzes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging data symmetries has been a key driver of performance gains in geometric deep learning and geometric and equivariant quantum machine learning. While symmetrization appears to be a promising method, its practical overhead, such as additional gates, reduced expressibility, and other factors, is not well understood in quantum machine learning. In this work, we develop an automated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning task. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of the subgroup it admits. Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not been extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries defined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to these varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of metrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying amounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference between the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts depth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third class of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results demonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that increased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases, increased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select sufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for geometric quantum machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Space-Bounded Communication Complexity of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study space-bounded communication complexity for unitary implementation in distributed quantum processors, where we restrict the number of qubits per processor to ensure practical relevance and technical non-triviality. We model distributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal two-qubit gates, defining the communication complexity of a unitary as the minimum number of such nonlocal gates required for its realization.
  Our contributions are twofold. First, for general $n$-qubit unitaries, we improve upon the trivial $O(4^n)$ communication bound. Considering $k$ pairwise-connected processors (each with $n/k$ data qubits and $m$ ancillas), we prove the communication complexity satisfies $O\left(\max\{4^{(1-1/k)n - m}, n\}\right)$--for example, $O(2^n)$ when $m=0$ and $k=2$--and establish the tightness of this upper bound. We further extend the analysis to approximation models and general network topologies. Second, for special unitaries, we show that both the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Clifford circuits admit linear upper bounds on communication complexity in the exact model, outperforming the trivial quadratic bounds applicable to these cases. In the approximation model, QFT's communication complexity reduces drastically from linear to logarithmic, while Clifford circuits retain a linear lower bound. These results offer fundamental insights for optimizing communication in distributed quantum unitary implementation, advancing the feasibility of large-scale distributed quantum computing (DQC) systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum time-marching algorithms for solving linear transport problems including boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the first complete application of a quantum time-marching algorithm for simulating multidimensional linear transport phenomena with arbitrary boundaries, whereby the success probabilities are problem intrinsic. The method adapts the linear combination of unitaries algorithm to block encode the diffusive dynamics, while arbitrary boundary conditions are enforced by the method of images only at the cost of one additional qubit per spatial dimension. As an alternative to the non-periodic reflection, the direct encoding of Neumann conditions by the unitary decomposition of the discrete time-marching operator is proposed. All presented algorithms indicate optimal success probabilities while maintaining linear time complexity, thereby securing the practical applicability of the quantum algorithm on fault-tolerant quantum computers. The proposed time-marching method is demonstrated through state-vector simulations of the heat equation in combination with Neumann, Dirichlet, and mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Random access Bell game by sequentially measuring the control of the quantum SWITCH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving quantum correlations such as Bell nonlocality in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge for quantum technologies. We introduce the Random Access Bell Game (RABG), a task where an entangled particle propagates through a sequence of identical noisy blocks, and the ability to violate a Bell inequality is tested at a randomly chosen point (access node). We consider a scenario where each noisy block is composed of two complete erasure channels, an extreme entanglement-breaking channel with vanishing quantum and classical capacities. We investigate the performance of the Random Access Bell Game in this configuration and attempt to mitigate the effect of noise by coherently controlling the order of each channel in the noise using the quantum {\tt SWITCH}. However, the quantum {\tt SWITCH} in its canonical setup with a coherent state in the control fails to provide any advantage in the Random Access Bell Game. Our main contribution is a protocol that leverages initial entanglement between the target and control of the quantum {\tt SWITCH} and employs sequential, unsharp measurements on the control system, showing that it is possible to guarantee a Bell violation after an arbitrarily large number of channel applications. Furthermore, our protocol allows for a near-maximal (Tsirelson bound) Bell violation to be achieved at any desired round, while still ensuring violations in all preceding rounds. We prove that this advantage is specific to generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, as the protocol fails for W-class states, thus providing an operational way to distinguish between these two fundamental classes of multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the (re-)construction of quasiprobability representations from generic measurements, including noisy ones. Based on the measurement under study, quasiprobabilities and the associated concept of nonclassicality are introduced. A practical concern that we address is the treatment of informationally incomplete and overcomplete measurement scenarios, which can significantly alter the assessment of which states are deemed classical. Notions, such as Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and s-parametrized quasiprobabilities in quantum optics, are generalized by our approach. Single-qubit systems are used to exemplify and to compare different measurement schemes, together with the resulting quasiprobabilities and set of nonclassical states.</description>

      <title>Cluster States Generation with a Quantum Metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implementation of photonic cluster state generation protocols using quantum metasurfaces comprising sub-wavelength atomic arrays which enables quantum-controlled reflectivity. These cluster states are generated using fundamental quantum logic gates and enable wide-ranging applications in quantum computation and communication. In the past few years, certain protocols have been developed, but their physical realizations induces natural losses on the system mainly originated from coupling the photonic structures, setting a limit on the efficiency and maximal qubit number. In this paper, we examine a physical implementation of two specific protocols for generating distinct cluster states: a two-dimensional cluster state and a tree cluster state. Our approach leverages the unique properties of a quantum metasurface and its free space settings to implement two-qubit quantum-logic gates, namely CNOT, CZ, and E gates, with practical fidelities exceeding 0.9, and potential speed-up due to parallelism. In addition, we analyze these protocols fidelities for practical conditions of potential implementation experiments, such as thermal fluctuation of trapped atoms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel self-correcting, high-speed optoelectronic probabilistic computer architecture that leverages source-device independent (SDI) quantum photonic p-bits integrated with robust electronic control. Our approach combines the intrinsic randomness and high bandwidth of quantum photonics with the programmability and scal- ability of classical electronics, enabling efficient and flexible probabilistic computation. We detail the design and implementation of a prototype system based on photonic integrated circuits and FPGA-based control, capable of implementing and manipulating 64000 logical p-bits. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture achieves a flip rate of 2.7 x 10^9 flips/s with an energy consumption of 4.9 nJ/flip, representing nearly three orders of magnitude improvement in speed and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art magnetic tunnel junc- tion (MTJ) based systems. Furthermore, the SDI protocol enables real-time self-certification and error correction, ensuring reliable operation across a wide range of conditions and solving the problem of hardware variability as the number of p-bits scale. Our results establish quantum photonic p-bits as a promising platform for scalable, high-performance probabilistic computing, with significant implications for combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and complex system modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phase-synchronization in a driven two-level system coupled to a non-Markovian bosonic reservoir. The dynamics is described by treating the system-bath coupling and the coherent drive without invoking the rotating-wave approximation, and simulated using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion. We observe that a robust phase-locking develops and that the corresponding synchronization measure rapidly acquires a finite value when the system is tuned to what we identify as a resonant-ratio condition, namely when the ratio between the drive amplitude and its frequency coincides with a zero of the Bessel function $J_0$. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon by means of a static approximation derived from a Fourier analysis of the periodically driven Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A General Strategy for Realizing Mpemba Effects in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a state farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to it, is a striking phenomenon in both classical and quantum systems. In open quantum systems, however, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) typically occurs only for specifically chosen initial states, which limits its universality. Here we present a general and experimentally feasible strategy to realize both QME and anti-QME. By applying a temporary bond-dissipation quench, we selectively suppresses or enhances slow relaxation modes, thereby reshaping relaxation pathways independently of both the system and the initial state. We demonstrate this mechanism in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation, and outline feasible cold-atom implementations. Our results establish controllable dissipation as a versatile tool for quantum control, accelerated relaxation, and efficient nonequilibrium protocols.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic geometric phase gates offer enhanced robustness against fluctuations compared to con- ventional Rydberg blockade-based phase gates that rely on dynamical phase accumulation. We theoretically demonstrate two- and multi-qubit phase gates in a neutral atom architecture, relying on a double stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence that imprints a controllable geometric phase on the qubit systems. The system is designed in such a way that every atom is individually addressable, and moreover, no extra laser is required to be applied on the target atom while scaling up the system from two- to multi-qubit quantum gates. The gate fidelity has been numerically analyzed by changing the gate operation time, and we find that 98% to 99% fidelity can be achieved for gate time $\simeq$ 0.6 $\mu$s. We perform a systematic error analysis, which re- veals that our proposed gates can exhibit strong resilience against fluctuations in Rabi frequencies, finite blockade strength, and atomic position variations. These results establish our approach as a physically feasible and scalable pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation with neutral atoms. We simulate Grover's search algorithm for two-, three-, and four-qubit systems with high success probability and thereby demonstrate the utility and scalability of our proposed gates for quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted cylindrical tubes are important model systems for nanostructures, heterostructures, and curved quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the quantum behavior of an electron confined to a twisted cylindrical surface. By first calculating the strain tensor to obtain the induced surface metric, we employ da Costa's formalism to derive the geometry-induced quantum potential. This potential modifies the Schr\"odinger equation even in the absence of external forces, allowing us to determine the bound states and energy eigenvalues. This was made in the linear and non-linear torsion regime. Furthermore, we analyze two distinct scattering problems: (i) scattering within an infinite cylinder containing a twisted section, and (ii) scattering of a free particle incident upon a finite twisted cylinder. Our goal is to understand how geometry and strain influence the properties of analogous untwisted systems. It turns out that both the linear and non-linear twists yield to a geometric phase into the wave function, while the da Costa potential is kept unchanged. Consequently, the system supports bound states whose energie spectrum is twist independent. For both scattering problems, we find that the transmission probability is insensitive to torsion, whereas it is significantly affected by the particle angular momentum and the cylinder's radius, exhibiting distinct oscillatory behavior. These findings suggest relevant implications for engineering quantum devices based on materials with controlled curvature and twist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protocols for quantum measurement are an essential part of quantum computing. Measurements are no longer confined to the final step of computation but are increasingly embedded within quantum circuits as integral components of noise-resilient algorithms. However, each observable typically requires a distinct measurement basis, often demanding a different circuit configuration. As the number of such configurations typically grows with the number of qubits, different measurement configurations constitute a major bottleneck. Focusing on electronic structure calculations in crystalline systems, we propose a measurement protocol that maximally reduces the number of measurement settings to just three, independent of the number of qubits. This makes it one of the few known protocols that do not scale with qubit number. In particular, we derive the measurement protocol from the symmetries of tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians and implement it within the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm. We demonstrate its performance on two systems, namely a two-dimensional CuO$_2$ square lattice (3 qubits) and bilayer graphene (4 qubits). The protocol can be generalized to more complex many-body Hamiltonians with high symmetry, providing a potential path toward future demonstrations of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Microwave Output Stabilization of a Qubit Controller via Device-Level Temperature Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and performance of QuEL-1 SE, which is a multichannel qubit controller developed for superconducting qubits. The system incorporates the active thermal stabilization of critical analog integrated circuits, such as phase-locked loops, amplifiers, and mixers, to suppress the long-term amplitude and phase drift. To evaluate the amplitude and phase stability, we simultaneously monitor 15 microwave output channels over 24 h using a common analog-to-digital converter. Across the channels, the normalized amplitude exhibits standard deviations of 0.09\%--0.22\% (mean: 0.15\%), and the phase deviations are 0.35$^\circ$--0.44$^\circ$ (mean: 0.39$^\circ$). We further assess the impact of these deviations on quantum gate operations by estimating the average fidelity of an $X_{\pi/2}$ gate under the coherent errors corresponding to the deviations. The resulting gate infidelities are $2\times 10^{-6}$ for amplitude errors and $2\times 10^{-5}$ for phase errors, which are significantly lower than typical fault-tolerance thresholds such as those of the surface code. These results demonstrate that the amplitude and phase stability of QuEL-1 SE enables reliable long-duration quantum operations, thus highlighting its utility as a scalable control platform for superconducting and other qubit modalities.</description>

      <title>Tight Analysis of a Grover-based Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret-sharing schemes allow a dealer to split a secret into multiple "shares" and distribute them individually among many parties while mandating certain constraints on its reconstruction. Such protocols are usually executed over a secure communication channel since an eavesdropper, after intercepting all the shares, is expected to be able to reconstruct the secret. Leveraging the unique properties of quantum channels, several quantum protocols have been designed for secret sharing. However, almost all of them detect the presence of an eavesdropper by statistical analysis of the outcome of multiple rounds, or simply require a secure channel of communication.
  We present a complete characterisation of the correctness and security properties of a quantum-search based secret-sharing framework proposed by Hsu (2003). The scheme was designed to work over public channels without requiring multiple rounds to detect eavesdropping. Our characterisation allowed us to improve the original protocol to be more resistant towards eavesdropping. However, we prove that complete security against an eavesdropper is not possible in this framework.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions in Imaginary-Time Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional Hamiltonians. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum data hiding against entangled catalysts and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum data hiding stores classical information in bipartite quantum states that are, in principle, perfectly distinguishable, yet remain almost indistinguishable without access to a quantum communication channel. Here, we investigate whether this limitation can be overcome when the communicating parties are assisted by additional quantum resources. We develop a general framework for state discrimination that unifies catalytic and memory-assisted local discrimination protocols and analyze their power to reveal hidden information. We prove that when the hiding states are separable, neither entangled catalysts nor quantum memory can increase the optimal discrimination probability, establishing the robustness of separable data-hiding schemes. In contrast, for some entangled states, a reusable quantum memory turns locally indistinguishable states into ones that can be discriminated almost perfectly. Our results delineate the fundamental limits of catalytic and memory-assisted state discrimination and identify separable encodings as a robust strategy for quantum data hiding.</description>

      <title>Quantum doubles in symmetric blockade structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exactly solvable models of topologically ordered phases with non-abelian anyons typically require complicated many-body interactions which do not naturally appear in nature. This motivates the "inverse problem" of quantum many-body physics: given microscopic systems with experimentally realistic two-body interactions, how to design a Hamiltonian that realizes a desired topological phase? Here we solve this problem on a platform motivated by Rydberg atoms, where elementary two-level systems couple via simple blockade interactions. Within this framework, we construct Hamiltonians that realize topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models. We analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state, and present efficient schemes to prepare these states. We also introduce protocols for the controlled adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their non-abelian statistics. Our construction is generic and applies to quantum doubles $\mathcal{D}(G)$ for arbitrary finite groups $G$. We illustrate braiding for the simplest non-abelian quantum double $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$.</description>

      <title>Estimating ground-state properties in quantum simulators with global control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems remains one of the major challenges of quantum simulation. In this work, we present a protocol for estimating the ground-state energy using only global time evolution under a target Hamiltonian. This avoids the need for controlled operations that are typically required in conventional quantum phase estimation and extends the algorithm applicability to analog simulators. Our method extracts energy differences from measurements of the Loschmidt echo over an initial ground-state approximation, combines them with direct energy measurements, and solves a set of equations to infer the individual eigenenergies. We benchmark this protocol on free-fermion systems, showing orders-of-magnitude precision gains over direct energy measurements on the initial state, with accuracy improving rapidly with initial-state fidelity and persisting for hundreds of modes. We further demonstrate applicability to the 2D Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models and show that the approach extends naturally to other observables such as order parameters. Finally, we analyze the effect of experimental imperfections and propose error-mitigation strategies. These results establish a practical route to compute physically relevant quantities with high precision using globally controlled quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Limiting one-way distillable secret key via privacy testing of extendible states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of privacy tests and $k$-extendible states have both been instrumental in quantum information theory, particularly in understanding the limits of secure communication. In this paper, we determine the maximum probability with which an arbitrary $k$-extendible state can pass a privacy test, and we prove that it is equal to the maximum fidelity between an arbitrary $k$-extendible state and the standard maximally entangled state. Our findings, coupled with the resource theory of $k$-unextendibility, lead to an efficiently computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable key of a bipartite state, and we prove that it is equal to the best-known efficiently computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable entanglement. We also establish efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot, forward-assisted private capacity of channels. Extending our formalism to the independent and identically distributed setting, we obtain single-letter efficiently computable bounds on the $n$-shot, one-way distillable key of a state and the $n$-shot, forward-assisted private capacity of a channel. For some key examples of interest, our bounds are significantly tighter than other known efficiently computable bounds.</description>

      <title>Robust certification of non-projective measurements: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the conditions under which positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), the most general class of quantum measurements, outperform projective measurements remains a challenging and largely unresolved problem. Of particular interest are projectively simulable POVMs, which can be realized through probabilistic mixtures of projective measurements, and therefore offer no advantage over projective schemes. Characterizing the boundary between simulable and non-simulable POVMs is, however, a difficult task, and existing tools either fail to scale efficiently, provide limited experimental feasibility or work only for specific POVMs. Here, we introduce and demonstrate a general method to certify non-simulability of a POVM by introducing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs. It provides upper bounds on the non-simulability measure of critical visibility of arbitrary POVMs which are tight in many cases and outperform previously known criteria. We experimentally certify the non-simulability of two- and three-dimensional POVMs using a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor by constructing non-simulability witnesses and introduce a modification of our framework that makes them robust against state preparation errors. Finally, we extend our results to the setting where an additional ancilla system is available.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Single-Ion Atomic-Ensemble Node for High-Rate Remote Entanglement Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different quantum systems possess different favorable qualities. On the one hand, ensemble-based quantum memories are suited for fast multiplexed long-range entanglement generation. On the other hand, single-atomic systems provide access to gates for processing of information. Both of those can provide advantages for high-rate entanglement generation within quantum networks. We develop a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of these properties by combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes comprised of spontaneous parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on rare-earth ion ensembles. To this end, we solve the central challenge of matching the different bandwidths of photons emitted by those systems in an initial entanglement-generation step. This enables the parallel execution of multiple probabilistic tasks in the initial stage. We show that our approach can lead to a significant speed-up for the fundamental task of creating ion-ion entanglement over hundreds of kilometers in a quantum network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators for quantum field theory. We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Scaling advantage with quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search for LABS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.</description>

      <title>Preferred Basis in Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the adiabatic regime, our understanding of quantum dynamics in coupled systems remains limited, and the choice of representation continues to obscure physical interpretation and simulation accuracy. Here we propose a natural and efficient basis for electron nuclear dynamics by drawing on the concepts of pointer and preferred states from decoherence theory, adapted to systems where electrons and nuclei interact strongly. Within this framework, we show that 1) the independent dynamics exploited by mixed quantum classical (MQC) methods is best understood as a manifestation of entanglement viewed in a preferred basis, rather than a consequence of decoherence, and 2) the adiabatic Born Oppenheimer states satisfy the conditions of an approximate preferred basis. This perspective reconciles widely used approximations with a more fundamental structure of the theory and provides a systematic route to more reliable MQC strategies. In effect, we revisit MQC methods through the lens of preferred states, clarifying when they succeed and how they can be improved.</description>

      <title>QEF: Reproducible and Exploratory Quantum Software Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercially available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices now make small hybrid quantum-classical experiments practical, but many tools hide configuration or demand ad-hoc scripting.
  We introduce the Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF): A lightweight framework designed to support the systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum algorithms. Unlike many existing approaches, QEF emphasises iterative, exploratory analysis of evolving experimental strategies rather than exhaustive empirical evaluation of fixed algorithms using predefined quality metrics. The framework's design is informed by a comprehensive review of the literature, identifying principal parameters and measurement practices currently reported in the field.
  QEF captures all key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of variants for controlled large-scale parameter sweeps. This design enables rigorous and systematic evaluation, as well as precise reproducibility. Large sweeps are automatically partitioned into asynchronous jobs across simulators or cloud hardware, and ascertain full hyper-parameter traceability. QEF supports parameter reuse to improve overall experiment runtimes, and collects all metrics and metadata into a form that can be conveniently explored with standard statistical and visualisation software.
  By combining reproducibility and scalability while avoiding the complexities of full workflow engines, QEF seeks to lower the practical barriers to empirical research on quantum algorithms, whether these are designed for current NISQ devices or future error-corrected quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Homodyne detection for pulse-by-pulse squeezing measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homodyne detection is a phase-sensitive measurement technique, essential for the characterization of continuous-variable (CV)-encoded quantum states of light. It is a key component to the implementation of CV quantum-information protocols and benefits from operating, by design, at room temperature. However, performing high-speed quantum information processing remains a major challenge, as conventional homodyne detectors often fail to sustain pulsed operation at high repetition rates due to electronic limitations. We present wideband homodyne detectors operating at near-infrared (NIR) and telecom wavelengths, with optimized performance at repetition rates up to 150 MHz. We demonstrate their performance by resolving the pulse-by-pulse structure of squeezed states of light at telecom wavelengths while preserving their spectral multimode properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate into experimentally detectable effects such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching. These regimes can be characterized using the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ that enters the two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}=(1-D_S)/2$. In the case of HOM bunching (antibunching), $D_S$ is positive (negative). Though the symmetry degree can generally be expressed in terms of the difference between the contributions coming from the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude (JSA), $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$, for a certain physically realizable class of the JSA, where $\psi(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ is proportional to the product of amplitudes $\varphi_1(\omega_1)\varphi_2(\omega_2)$ multiplied by a Gaussian shaped entangling factor, we find the sign of $D_S$ is primarily governed by the parity properties of the spectral function, $\varphi_{12}(\omega)=\varphi_1(\omega)\varphi_2^*(\omega)$. It is the even (odd) part of $\varphi_{12}=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}+\varphi_{12}^{(-)}$ that meets the parity condition $\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\omega-\Omega)=\varphi_{12}^{(+)}(\Omega-\omega)$ ($\varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\omega-\Omega)=- \varphi_{12}^{(-)}(\Omega-\omega)$) to yield the positive (negative) contribution, $D_S^{(+)}$ ($-D_S^{(-)}$), to the symmetry degree parameter: $D_S=D_S^{(+)}-D_S^{(-)}$. We have shown that switching between the bunching and antibunching regimes can be realized using the experimentally accessible family of modulated biphoton states produced using the spectral phase modulation fine-tuned via the sub-nanometer scale variation of the path length. For this class of modulated states, the Schmidt number has been computed as a function of the modulation parameter. This dependence reveals the structure of narrow resonance peaks strongly correlated with the corresponding narrow dips of the symmetry degree where the HOM antibunching occurs.</description>

      <title>Qubit Mapping and Routing tailored to Advanced Quantum ISAs: Not as Costly as You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-$ \mathrm{CX} $-unrolled SWAP insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported by physical devices.
  Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard $\mathrm{CX}$-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as $\mathrm{\sqrt{iSWAP}}$ and $\mathrm{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates offer superior circuit synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However, systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are lacking.
  To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit canonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost for more intelligent $ \mathrm{SWAP} $ insertion during the routing stage. We also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based optimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing overhead by 15\%-35\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different ISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Cryptography in Linear Quantum Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cryptography is a rapidly-developing area which leverages quantum information to accomplish classically-impossible tasks. In many of these protocols, quantum states are used as long-term cryptographic keys. Typically, this is to ensure the keys cannot be copied by an adversary, owing to the quantum no-cloning theorem. Unfortunately, due to quantum state's tendency to decohere, persistent quantum memory will likely be one of the most challenging resources for quantum computers. As such, it will be important to minimize persistent memory in quantum protocols.
  In this work, we consider the case of one-shot signatures (OSS), and more general quantum signing tokens. These are important unclonable primitives, where quantum signing keys allow for signing a single message but not two. Naturally, these quantum signing keys would require storage in long-term quantum memory. Very recently, the first OSS was constructed in a classical oracle model and also in the standard model, but we observe that the quantum memory required for these protocols is quite large. In this work, we significantly decrease the quantum secret key size, in some cases achieving asymptotically optimal size. To do so, we develop novel techniques for proving the security of cryptosystems using coset states, which are one of the main tools used in unclonable cryptography.</description>

      <title>Random Construction of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for modifying orthogonal sparse matrix pairs used in CSS codes while preserving their matrix row and column weight distributions, which play a crucial role in determining the performance of belief-propagation decoding. Unlike simple row or column permutations that merely reorder existing elements, the proposed local modification introduces genuine structural randomness through small $2\times2$ cross-swap operations followed by integer-linear-program-based local repairs that restore orthogonality. By applying this procedure repeatedly in a random manner, ensembles of randomized quantum LDPC codes can be constructed. The computational complexity of each repair depends only on the maximum row and column weights and is independent of the overall matrix size, ensuring scalability to large code blocks.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Non-local Photonic Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between quantum systems enable quantum gates, the building blocks of quantum information processing. In photonics, direct photon-photon interactions are too weak to be practically useful, so effective interactions are engineered with linear optics and measurement. A central challenge is to realize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain spatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential non-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in both qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by the AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared entanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum indistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent superpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we uncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum teleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements. Technically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical resource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they demonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and techniques in physics.</description>

      <title>Photodetection of Squeezed Light: a Whittaker-Shannon Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Whittaker-Shannon decomposition provides a temporally localized description of squeezed light, making it applicable in the CW limit and leading to a definition of squeezing strength based on the number of photon pairs at a time. We show examples of its usefulness by calculating quadrature variance in a homodyne detection scheme, coincidence detection probabilities in the continuous-wave limit, and analyzing the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect for strongly squeezed light. Quadrature uncertainty falls farther below the shot noise limit when squeezing is strong, but effects due to correlations between photon pairs are most significant with weak squeezing. Our analysis extends previous results to more general scenarios, and we leverage the Whittaker-Shannon formalism to interpret them based on the temporal properties of photon pairs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search With Generalized Wildcards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight $O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound.
  We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a subset $\cal{Q} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S = b$ for an arbitrary $S \in \cal{Q}$ and $b \in \{-1,1\}^S$ of its choice, at unit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\cal{Q}$ is any of the following collections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full set.
  All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using symmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of learning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization program, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd functions $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$ to the maximum (over $T \in \cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube whose free variables are exactly $T$.'
  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal version of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program typically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds without explicitly resorting to SDP duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20312v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.</description>

      <title>Variations on a Theme of Krylov</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Entanglement Entropy and Edge Modes from Double-Scaled SYK \&amp; Its Connection with Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement entropy in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model, its holographic interpretation in terms of edge modes (acting as quantum reference frames); particularly its de Sitter (dS) space limit; and its connection with Krylov complexity. We define subsystems relative to a particle insertion in the boundary theory. This leads to a natural notion of partial trace and reduced density matrices. The corresponding entanglement entropy takes the form of a generalized horizon entropy in the bulk dual; revealing the emergence of edge modes in the entangling surfaces. We match the entanglement entropy of the DSSYK in an appropriate limit to an area computed through a \emph{Ryu-Takayanagi formula} in dS$_2$ space with entangling surfaces at $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$; providing a first principles example of holographic entanglement entropy for dS$_2$ space. This formula reproduces the Gibbons-Hawking entropy for specific entangling regions points; while it decreases for others. This construction does not display some of the puzzling features in dS holography. The entanglement entropy remains real-valued (since the boundary theory is unitary), and it depends on Krylov state complexity in this limit.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</description>

      <title>Holographic black hole formation and scrambling in time-ordered correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a holographic mechanism for black hole formation via the collision of two shockwaves in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT), a two-shockwave state corresponds to the insertion of two boosted precursor operators in complementary Rindler patches. Their operator product expansion is initially described by a universal mean field spectrum of exchanged states, which is dominated by operator dimensions that grow exponentially in the boost parameter. We propose their mean value as diagnosing the mass of the collision product in the bulk. It crosses the CFT heavy state threshold after two scrambling times, in accordance with expectations about black hole formation in general relativity. Our analysis also allows us to identify the scrambling characteristics usually associated with out-of-time-order correlation functions, using only the internal composition of thermal in-time-order correlators.</description>

      <title>Quadrature-witness readout for backscatter mitigation in gravitational-wave detectors limited by back-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disturbances in gravitational wave (GW) observational data are often caused by non-stationary noise in the detector itself, such as back-scattering of laser stray light into the signal field. Unlike GW signals, non-stationary noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity and robustness of GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Loschmidts Paradox via Geometric Constraints on Information Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve Loschmidt's paradox -- the apparent contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution -- including the long-standing puzzle of the thermodynamic arrow of time. The resolution: entropy increases not because dynamics are asymmetric, but because information accessibility is geometrically bounded. For Hamiltonian systems (conservative dynamics), Lyapunov exponents come in positive-negative pairs ($\{\lambda_i, -\lambda_i\}$) due to symplectic structure. Under time reversal these pairs flip ($\lambda_i \to -\lambda_i$), but stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution $\lambda = \hbar/\sqrt{mk_BT}$, becoming physically indistinguishable. We always observe only unstable manifolds where trajectories diverge. Hence information loss proceeds at the same rate $h_{KS} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\text{all } i}|\lambda_i|$ in both time directions, resolving the arrow of time: ``forward'' simply means ``where we observe expansion,'' which is universal because stable manifolds always contract below measurability. Quantitatively, for N$_2$ gas at STP with conservative estimates ($h_{KS} \sim 10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$), time reversal at $t = 1$ nanosecond requires momentum precision $\sim 10^{-13}$ times quantum limits -- geometrically impossible. At macroscopic times, the precision requirement becomes $\sim 10^{-10^{10}}$ times quantum limits. This framework preserves microscopic time-reversal symmetry, requires no special initial conditions or Past Hypothesis, and extends to quantum systems (OTOCs) and black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Legal Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two physical systems are correlated in such a way that they appear to instantaneously affect one another, regardless of the distance between them. As commonly understood, Bell's Theorem famously demonstrates that any causal explanation of entanglement must discard either locality (the principle that nothing, including information, travels faster than light) or classical notions of realism (or both). Drawing on this concept, several legal scholars have metaphorically described 'entangled' legal concepts. For instance, if a state's highest court redefines the concept of 'foreseeability' in negligence law, this redefinition alters the concept of 'reasonable care' immediately in the eyes of the law. Godfrey (2024) is the first work to mathematically model entangled legal concepts, particularly in the context of legal interpretation. Here, we extend the quantification to the formulation and delineation of law (lawmaking) and the adjudication of law (judgment). In so doing, we connect legal entanglement to Sichelman's (2022) work on legal entropy, complexity, and the informational content of law. In addition to quantifying entanglement across various legal contexts, our approach provides broader insights. For example, it offers a more comprehensive analysis of the uses and limits of 'modularity' in law--specifically, the role legal boundaries (spatial or intangible) play in reducing information costs within legal systems. Moreover, we discuss how our model can improve theories of legal artificial intelligence. Finally, we explore the application of legal theory back to physics. If quantum physical entanglement operates analogously to legal entanglement, it requires discarding both locality and classical realism, though not in the manner commonly imagined.</description>

      <title>Fast Transport of Trapped Ultracold Atoms Using Shortcuts-to-Adiabaticity by Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the fast spatial transport of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using shortcuts-to-adiabaticity (STA) by counterdiabatic driving (CD). The trapping potential and the required auxiliary potential were simulated as painted potentials. We compared STA transport to transport that follows a constant-acceleration scheme (CA). Experimentally feasible values of trap depth and atom number were used in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) simulations. Different transport times, trap depths, and trap lengths were investigated. In all simulations, there exists a minimum amount of time necessary for fast transport, which is consistent with previous results from quantum speed limit studies.</description>

      <title>Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</description>

      <title>High-Tc superconductivity above 130 K in cubic MH4 compounds at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4, with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K, respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K. The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and applications at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Determination of quark-gluon-quark interference within the proton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarks and gluon, as quantum particles, are subjects to various effects that go beyond the naive parton picture and are not captured by ordinary parton densities. In this work, we investigate the twist-three parton distribution functions, which encode quantum interference between quark-gluon-quark states, and for the first time, determine them directly from experimental data. The analysis combines observables described by collinear and transverse-momentum-dependent factorization theorems within a unified global fit, incorporating a complete leading-order QCD evolution at the twist-three level. The extracted distributions reveal a clear flavor-dependent patterns and distinct from zero at a statistically significant level ($2-3\sigma$). These findings provide the first quantitative evidence for quark-gluon-quark correlations within the proton, revealing its genuinely quantum nature and opening a new direction for precision studies of partonic correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum dot thermal machines - a guide to engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached. However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine, such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate transmission level.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental target.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance from quantum information principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a hallmark of quantum theory, yet it alone does not capture the full extent of quantum complexity: some highly entangled states can still be classically simulated. Non-classical behavior also requires magic, the non-Clifford component that enables universal quantum computation. Here, we investigate whether the interplay between entanglement and magic constrains the structure of fundamental interactions. We study gluon-gluon and graviton-graviton scattering at tree level, explicitly breaking gauge and general covariance by modifying the quartic vertices and analyzing the resulting generation of entanglement and magic. We find that imposing maximal entanglement (MaxEnt) alone does not uniquely recover gauge-invariant and diffeomorphism-invariant interactions, but adding the condition of minimal, but nonzero, magic singles it out. Our results indicate that nature favors MaxEnt and low magic: maximal quantum correlations with limited non-Cliffordness, sufficient for universal quantum computing but close to classical simulability. This dual informational principle may underlie the emergence of gauge invariance in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as a Dynamical Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</description>

      <title>Normalized tensor train decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensors with unit Frobenius norm are fundamental objects in many fields, including scientific computing and quantum physics, which are able to represent normalized eigenvectors and pure quantum states. While the tensor train decomposition provides a powerful low-rank format for tackling high-dimensional problems, it does not intrinsically enforce the unit-norm constraint. To address this, we introduce the normalized tensor train (NTT) decomposition, which aims to approximate a tensor by unit-norm tensors in tensor train format. The low-rank structure of NTT decomposition not only saves storage and computational cost but also preserves the underlying unit-norm structure. We prove that the set of fixed-rank NTT tensors forms a smooth manifold, and the corresponding Riemannian geometry is derived, paving the way for geometric methods. We propose NTT-based methods for low-rank tensor recovery, high-dimensional eigenvalue problem, estimation of stabilizer rank, and calculation of the minimum output R\'enyi 2-entropy of quantum channels. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and scalability of the proposed NTT-based methods.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enriched topological order and quasi-fractonic behavior in $\mathbb{Z}_N$ stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$ bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$ are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular, this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior, resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a computational algebraic method using Gr\"{o}bner bases over the ring of integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum entanglement with Generalized Parton Distributions at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the collinear factorization framework based on Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), we calculate the spin density matrix of exclusively produced quark and antiquark pairs $u\bar{u}$, $d\bar{d}$, $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, $b\bar{b}$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering. The presence of both real and imaginary parts in the GPD amplitudes leads to a rich pattern of entanglement between the quark and the antiquark. We map out kinematical regions where the pairs exhibit entanglement, Bell nonlocality and non-stabilizerness (`magic'). We also predict that massive quarks and antiquarks are transversely polarized, similar to the well-known transverse hyperon polarization in unpolarized collisions. In strangeness, charm and bottom productions, the polarization can reach 50-80% in certain kinematic regions in the low-energy runs of the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

Abstract: Donor spin qubits in silicon offer one- and two-qubit gates with fidelities beyond 99%, coherence times exceeding 30 seconds, and compatibility with industrial manufacturing methods. This motivates the development of large-scale quantum processors using this platform, and the ability to automatically tune and operate such complex devices. In this work, we present the first machine learning algorithm with the ability to automatically locate the charge transitions of an ion-implanted donor in a silicon device, tune single-shot charge readout, and identify the gate voltage parameters where tunnelling rates in and out the donor site are the same. The entire tuning pipeline is completed on the order of minutes. Our results enable both automatic characterisation and tuning of a donor in silicon devices faster than human experts.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Casimir densities for a uniformly accelerating mirror in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the local characteristics of the Fulling-Rindler vacuum for a massive Dirac field induced by a planar boundary moving with constant proper acceleration in $(D+1)$-dimensional flat spacetime. On the boundary, the field operator obeys the bag boundary condition. The boundary divides the right Rindler wedge into two separate regions, called RL and RR regions. In both these regions, the fermion condensate and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two contributions. The first one presents the VEVs in the Fulling-Rindler vacuum when the boundary is absent and the second one is the boundary-induced contribution. For points away from the boundary, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the boundary-free geometry. The total VEVs are dominated by the boundary-free parts near the Rindler horizon and by the boundary-induced parts in the region near the boundary. For a massive field the boundary-free contributions in the fermion condensate and the vacuum energy density and effective pressures are negative everywhere. The boundary-induced contributions in the fermion condensate and the energy density are positive in the RL region and negative in the RR region. For a massless field the fermion condensate vanishes in spatial dimensions $D\geq 2$, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is different from zero. This behavior contrasts with that of the VEVs in the Minkowski vacuum for the geometry of a boundary at rest relative to an inertial observer. In the latter case, the fermion condensate for a massless field is nonzero, while the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor becomes zero.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the superfluid properties of a two-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in the zero-temperature regime, when it is subjected to a triangular optical lattice potential. We implement an original method, which involves solving the hydrodynamic continuity equation to extract the superfluid fraction tensor from the measured in situ density distribution of the fluid at rest. In parallel, we apply an independent dynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity measurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield consistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured density profiles.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) grants competitive advantages, especially in resource usage and circuit approximation, for performing arithmetic operations on quantum computers, and offers a potential route towards a numerical quantum-computational paradigm. In this paper, we utilize efficient techniques to implement QFT-based integer addition and multiplications. These operations are fundamental to various quantum applications including Shor's algorithm, weighted sum optimization problems in data processing and machine learning, and quantum algorithms requiring inner products. We carry out performance evaluations of these implementations based on IBM's superconducting qubit architecture using different compatible noise models. We isolate the sensitivity of the component quantum circuits on both one-/two-qubit gate error rates, and the number of the arithmetic operands' superposed integer states. We analyze performance, and identify the most effective approximation depths for unsigned quantum addition and quantum multiplication within the given context. We then perform a similar analysis of signed addition and compare to the unsigned results. We observe significant dependency of the optimal approximation depth on the degree of machine noise and the number of superposed states in certain performance regimes. Finally, we elaborate on the algorithmic challenges - relevant to signed, unsigned, modular and non-modular versions - that could also be applied to current implementations of QFT-based subtraction, division, exponentiation, and their potential tensor extensions. We analyze the performance trends in our results and speculate on possible future developments within this computational paradigm.</description>

      <title>Path distributions for describing eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and other 1-dimensional problems</title>

Abstract: The manner in which probability amplitudes of paths sum up to form wave functions of a harmonic oscillator, as well as other, simple 1-dimensional problems, is described. Using known, closed-form, path-based propagators for each problem, an integral expression is written that describes the wave function. This expression conventionally takes the form of an integral over initial locations of a particle, but it is re-expressed here in terms of a characteristic momentum associated with motion between the endpoints of a path. In this manner, the resulting expression can be analyzed using a generalization of stationary-phase analysis, leading to distributions of paths that exactly describe each eigenstate. These distributions are valid for all travel times, but when evaluated for long times they turn out to be real, non-negative functions of the characteristic momentum. For the harmonic oscillator in particular, a somewhat broad distribution is found, peaked at value of momentum that corresponds to a classical energy which in turn equals the energy eigenvalue for the state being described.</description>

Abstract: The n-qubit Pauli group and its normalizer the n-qubit Clifford group have applications in quantum error correction and device characterization. Recent applications have made use of the representation theory of the Clifford group. We apply the tools of (the coincidentally named) Clifford theory to examine the representation theory of the Clifford group using the much simpler representation theory of the Pauli group. We find an unexpected correspondence between irreducible characters of the n-qubit Clifford group and those of the (n+1)-qubit Clifford group.</description>

      <title>Double-bracket quantum algorithms for high-fidelity ground state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground state preparation is a central application for quantum computers but remains challenging in practice. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the performance and gate counts of double-bracket quantum algorithms (DBQAs) for ground state preparation. We propose a practical strategy in which DBQAs refine initial state preparation circuits, and we compile them for Heisenberg chains using controlled-Z and single-qubit gates. Warm-started DBQAs consistently improve both the energy and ground-state fidelity relative to the initial states provided by variational ans\"atze, indicating that DBQAs offer an effective unitary synthesis method. To demonstrate compatibility with near-term hardware, we executed a proof-of-concept example on IBM devices. With error mitigation, we observed a statistically significant improvement over the corresponding warm-start circuit. Furthermore, numerical emulations for the same system size indicate that executing DBQAs on Quantinuum's hardware could achieve similar cost-function gains without requiring error mitigation. These findings suggest that DBQAs are a promising approach for enhancing ground-state approximations on near-term quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We show that a symmetric informationally-complete positive operator-valued measure exists in a given dimension $d$ if and only if there exists a $d^2$-dimensional operator system satisfying certain order-theoretic conditions. We also describe a method of constructing such an operator system and demonstrate that the first step of this construction can be carried out successfully. We obtain analogous results for the existence of $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases in a given dimension.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging field recognized for the significant speedup it offers over classical computing through quantum algorithms. However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all, QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.</description>

      <title>Optimization Algorithm for Inventory Allocation in Gravity-Flow Racks with Classical and Quantum-Hybrid Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Warehouses play a central role in industrial logistics, functioning as critical hubs for storing and organizing inventory to support efficient production. Optimizing item allocation within these facilities is essential for reducing operational costs and improving delivery times. In this work, we address the optimization of inventory allocation in warehouses equipped with gravity-flow racks, which are designed for First In, First Out (FIFO) logistics, a configuration that inherently requires item reinsertions during retrieval operations to maintain flow continuity. These reinsertions, however, are time-consuming and costly, so minimizing their occurrence is crucial for operational efficiency. We propose an optimization strategy that simultaneously allocates multiple items, determining their placement across available shelves in a single decision step, explicitly accounting for every item and every shelf in the warehouse. By jointly evaluating multiple items, our approach enables globally optimized placement decisions, minimizing conflicts that arise in sequential methods. The problem is formulated as a QUBO, allowing implementation on both classical metaheuristics and quantum-hybrid solvers. We assess performance by comparing three classical optimization approaches - two variants of Simulated Annealing and the commercial solver Gurobi - with D-Wave's hybrid solver, which uniquely combines quantum annealing with classical metaheuristics. Complementing these benchmarks, a factory-scale simulation based on real operational data shows that considering larger batches of items in the allocation step can significantly reduce reinsertions, highlighting the practical potential of the proposed approach for industrial logistics.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Neural Galerkin Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a classical computational method for quantum dynamics that relies on a global-in-time variational principle. Unlike conventional time-stepping approaches, our scheme computes the entire state trajectory over a finite time window by minimizing a loss function that enforces the Schr\"odinger's equation. The variational state is parametrized with a Galerkin-inspired ansatz based on a time-dependent linear combination of time-independent Neural Quantum States. This structure is particularly well-suited for exploring long-time dynamics and enables bounding the error with the exact evolution via the global loss function. We showcase the method by simulating global quantum quenches in the paradigmatic Transverse-Field Ising model in both 1D and 2D, uncovering signatures of ergodicity breaking and absence of thermalization in two dimensions. Overall, our method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art time-dependent variational approaches, while unlocking previously inaccessible dynamical regimes of strongly interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) fundamentally limits the bandwidth available for quantum information processing. Despite its importance, no prior experiment has systematically examined how driving detuning affects the indistinguishability of photons scattered from a TLE - a parameter critical for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference measurements between mutually detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. At small mutual laser detunings (&lt;=0.5GHz), the results are accurately described by the pure-state model [Nat. Commun. 16, 6453 (2025)], which treats all resonance-fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission. At larger detunings, we uncover an anomalous feature in the two-photon interference, where the normalised second-order correlation function under orthogonal polarisations yields g2_vert(0) &lt; 0.5.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a numerical framework for integrating Markovian dynamics on tree tensor operator (TTO) ansatz states. This framework enables the simulation of both transient and steady-state regimes of systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, while preserving positivity of the density matrix and providing direct access to entanglement monotones. We demonstrate its capability to probe entanglement in open quantum many-body systems and to distinguish it from other correlations by studying a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain. Our analysis uncovers entanglement transitions driven by both the coupling to the environment and the anisotropy, revealing a striking connection between spatial entanglement scaling and spin-current.</description>

      <title>Interpolation-based coordinate descent method for parameterized quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are ubiquitous in the design of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. In this work, we propose an interpolation-based coordinate descent (ICD) method to address the parameter optimization problem in PQCs. The ICD method provides a unified framework for existing structure optimization techniques such as Rotosolve, sequential minimal optimization, ExcitationSolve, and others. ICD employs interpolation to approximate the PQC cost function, effectively recovering its underlying trigonometric structure, and then performs an argmin update on a single parameter in each iteration. In contrast to previous studies on structure optimization, we determine the optimal interpolation nodes to mitigate statistical errors arising from quantum measurements. Moreover, in the common case of $r$ equidistant frequencies, we show that the optimal interpolation nodes are equidistant nodes with spacing $2\pi/(2r+1)$ (under constant variance assumption), and that our ICD method simultaneously minimizes the mean squared error, the condition number of the interpolation matrix, and the average variance of the approximated cost function. We perform numerical simulations and test on the MaxCut problem, the transverse field Ising model, and the XXZ model. Numerical results imply that our ICD method is more efficient than the commonly used gradient descent and random coordinate descent method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of cosmological particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics through the lens of entanglement. We use the entanglement contour (EC) to analyse the spatio-temporal structure of particle production, showing that a quasi-particle picture for the EC captures the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifests through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays are a front-running platform for quantum processors. A major challenge threatening the scalability of this platform is the limited qubit connectivity due to the finite range of interatomic interactions. We explore an approach to realize dynamical all-to-all connectivity with the use of moving "messenger" atomic qubits that couple distant "computational" qubits held in a static tweezer array. We detail and compare four specific architectures based on this concept, each presenting distinct advantages and challenges tied to the efficacy of techniques used to couple, move and measure atomic qubits. We demonstrate that, though technologically demanding, the messenger-qubit paradigm opens a promising avenue to a truly scalable quantum processor based on Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deterministic and time-reversal symmetric dynamics of isolated quantum systems is at odds with irreversible equilibration observed in generic thermodynamic systems. Standard approaches at a reconciliation employ subjective restrictions on the space of observables or states and do not explain how a single macroscopic quantum system achieves equilibrium dynamically. We instead argue that quantum theory is an effective theory and requires corrections to accurately describe systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. We construct a stochastic extension of quantum theory which is practically identical to quantum mechanics for microscopic systems, yet allows single, isolated macroscopic systems to objectively thermalize, generically. A fluctuation-dissipation relation guarantees physical consistency including norm preservation, energy conservation, no superluminal signalling and the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium. We further discuss the inclusion of objective collapse, thereby realizing a falsifiable theory of spontaneous universal irreversibility which describes the quantum-to-classical crossover dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems. The dynamics of the model describe spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum state reduction and objective quantum thermalization for individual systems while realizing an emergent hybrid statistics for ensembles which interpolates between Born's rules and microcanonical equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We derive some properties of the hydrogen atom inside a box with an impenetrable wall that have not been discussed before. Suitable scaling of the Hamiltonian operator proves to be useful for the derivation of some general properties of the eigenvalues. The radial part of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is conditionally solvable and the exact polynomial solutions provide useful information. There are accidental degeneracies that take place at particular values of the box radius, some of which can be determined from the conditionally-solvable condition. Some of the roots stemming from the conditionally-solvable condition appear to converge towards the critical values of the model parameter. This analysis is facilitated by the Rayleigh-Ritz method that provides accurate eigenvalues.</description>

Quantum computers may help solve them by sampling from carefully prepared Ansatz quantum circuits. However, current quantum computers are limited by their qubit count, connectivity, and noise. This is particularly restrictive when considering optimization problems beyond the quadratic order. Here, we introduce Ansatze based on an approximate quadratization of high-order Hamiltonians which do not incur a qubit overhead. The price paid is a loss in the quality of the noiseless solution. Crucially, this approximation yields shallower Ansatze which are more robust to noise than the standard QAOA one. We show this through simulations of systems of 8 to 16 qubits with variable noise strengths. Furthermore, we also propose a noise-aware Ansatz design method for quadratic optimization problems. This method implements only part of the corresponding Hamiltonian by limiting the number of layers of SWAP gates in the Ansatz. We find that for both problem types, under noise, our approximate implementation of the full problem structure can significantly enhance the solution quality. Our work opens a path to enhance the solution quality that approximate quantum optimization achieves on noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Low-Level and NUMA-Aware Optimization for High-Performance Quantum Simulation</title>

Abstract: Scalable classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for advancing quantum algorithm development and validating emerging hardware. This work focuses on performance enhancements through targeted low-level and NUMA-aware tuning on a single-node system, thereby not only advancing the efficiency of classical quantum simulations but also establishing a foundation for scalable, heterogeneous implementations that bridge toward noiseless quantum computing. Although few prior studies have reported similar hardware-level optimizations, such implementations have not been released as open-source software, limiting independent validation and further development. We introduce an open-source, high-performance extension to the QuEST state vector simulator that integrates state-of-the-art low-level and NUMA-aware optimizations for modern processors. Our approach emphasizes locality-aware computation and incorporates hardware-specific techniques including NUMA-aware memory allocation, thread pinning, AVX-512 vectorization, aggressive loop unrolling, and explicit memory prefetching. Experiments demonstrate substantial speedups--5.5-6.5x for single-qubit gate operations, 4.5x for two-qubit gates, 4x for Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), and 1.8x for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Algorithmic workloads further achieve 4.3-4.6x acceleration for Grover and 2.5x for Shor-like circuits. These results show that systematic, architecture-aware tuning can significantly extend the practical simulation capacity of classical quantum simulators on current hardware.</description>

Abstract: In a seminal article, Higuchi and Sudbery showed that a pure four-qubit state can not be maximally entangled across every bipartition. Such states are now known as absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states. Here we give a series of old and new proofs of the fact that no four-qubit AME state exists. These are based on invariant theory, methods from coding theory, and basic properties from linear algebra such as the Pauli commutation relations.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC.
  As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Learning stabilizer structure of quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of learning a structured stabilizer decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-qubit quantum state $|\psi\rangle$: for $\epsilon &gt; 0$, output a state $|\phi\rangle$ with stabilizer-rank $\textsf{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ such that $|\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+|\phi'\rangle$ where $|\phi'\rangle$ has stabilizer fidelity $&lt; \epsilon$. We first show the existence of such decompositions using the recently established inverse theorem for the Gowers-$3$ norm of states [AD,STOC'25].
  To learn this structure, we initiate the task of self-correction of a state $|\psi\rangle$ with respect to a class of states $S$: given copies of $|\psi\rangle$ which has fidelity $\geq \tau$ with a state in $S$, output $|\phi\rangle \in S$ with fidelity $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \tau^C$ for a constant $C&gt;1$. Assuming the algorithmic polynomial Frieman-Rusza (APFR) conjecture in the high doubling regime (whose combinatorial version was recently resolved [GGMT,Annals of Math.'25]), we give a polynomial-time algorithm for self-correction of stabilizer states. Given access to the state preparation unitary $U_\psi$ for $|\psi\rangle$ and its controlled version $cU_\psi$, we give a polynomial-time protocol that learns a structured decomposition of $|\psi\rangle$. Without assuming APFR, we give a quasipolynomial-time protocol for the same task.
  As our main application, we give learning algorithms for states $|\psi\rangle$ promised to have stabilizer extent $\xi$, given access to $U_\psi$ and $cU_\psi$. We give a protocol that outputs $|\phi\rangle$ which is constant-close to $|\psi\rangle$ in time $\textsf{poly}(n,\xi^{\log \xi})$, which can be improved to polynomial-time assuming APFR. This gives an unconditional learning algorithm for stabilizer-rank $k$ states in time $\textsf{poly}(n,k^{k^2})$. As far as we know, learning arbitrary states with even stabilizer-rank $2$ was unknown.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of multi-copy activation of genuine multipartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is, correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual copies.</description>

      <title>Matrix product state approach to lossy boson sampling and noisy IQP sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling problems have emerged as a central avenue for demonstrating quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, physical noise can fundamentally alter their computational complexity, often making them classically tractable. Motivated by the recent success of matrix product state (MPS)-based classical simulation of Gaussian boson sampling (Oh et al., 2024), we extend this framework to investigate the classical simulability of other noisy quantum sampling models. We develop MPS-based classical algorithms for lossy boson sampling and noisy instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling, both of which retain the tunable accuracy characteristic of the MPS approach through the bond dimension. Our approach constructs pure-state decompositions of noisy or lossy input states whose components remain weakly entangled after circuit evolution, thereby providing a means to systematically explore the boundary between quantum-hard and classically-simulable regimes. For boson sampling, we analyze single-photon, Fock, and cat-state inputs, showing that classical simulability emerges at transmission rates scaling as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$, reaching the known boundary of quantum advantage with a tunable and scalable method. Beyond reproducing previous thresholds, our algorithm offers significantly improved control over the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. It further extends the applicability of MPS-based simulation to broader classes of noisy quantum sampling models, including IQP circuits.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Highly Parallel Electromagnetic Simulations for Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic simulations form an indispensable part of the design and optimization process for superconducting quantum devices. Although several commercial platforms exist, open-source alternatives optimized for high-performance computing remain limited. To address this gap, we introduce SQDMetal, a Python-based API that integrates Qiskit Metal (IBM), Gmsh, Palace (AWS), and Paraview (Kitware) into an open-source, highly parallel simulation workflow for superconducting quantum circuits. SQDMetal enables accurate, efficient, and scalable simulations while remaining community-driven and free from commercial constraints. In this work, we validate SQDMetal through mesh convergence studies which benchmark SQDMetal against COMSOL Multiphysics and Ansys, demonstrating excellent agreement for both eigenmode and electrostatic (capacitance) simulations. Furthermore, we simulate superconducting resonators and transmon qubits, showing reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. SQDMetal also supports advanced capabilities, including Hamiltonian extraction via the energy participation ratio (EPR) method, incorporation of kinetic inductance effects, and full 3D modelling of device geometry for improved predictive accuracy. By unifying open-source tools into a single framework, SQDMetal lowers the barriers to entry for community members seeking to access high-performance simulations to assist in the design and optimization of their devices.</description>

Abstract: We unravel a deep connection between limits of real numbers and limits in category theory. Using a new variant of the classical characterisation of the real numbers, we characterise the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear contractions in terms of simple category-theoretic structures and properties that do not refer to norms, continuity, or real numbers. This builds on Heunen, Kornell, and Van der Schaaf's easier characterisation of the category of all Hilbert spaces and linear contractions.</description>

      <title>Localization and entanglement characterization of edge states in HgTe quantum wells in a finite strip geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector --measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-- and from correlation functions for a $y$-space partition. The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region. For a real-space partition, the edge-state region in momentum space exhibits lower correlation modulus, but higher correlation arguments, than the bulk-state region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ regularisation and the functional measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in Metric Variables: The $\bar{\mu}$ Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</description>

Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>General theory for geometry-dependent non-Hermitian bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two- and higher-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices, systems can exhibit geometry-dependent bands, where the spectrum and eigenstates under open boundary conditions depend on the bulk geometry even in the thermodynamic limit. Although geometry-dependent bands are widely observed, the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon remains unclear. In this work, we address this problem by establishing a higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory based on the concept of "strip generalized Brillouin zones" (SGBZs), which describe the asymptotic behavior of non-Hermitian bands when a lattice is extended sequentially along its linearly independent axes. Within this framework, we demonstrate that geometry-dependent bands arise from the incompatibility of SGBZs and, for the first time, derive a general criterion for the geometry dependence of non-Hermitian bands: non-zero area of the complex energy spectrum or the imaginary momentum spectrum. Our work opens an avenue for future studies on the interplay between geometric effects and non-Hermitian physics, such as non-Hermitian band topology.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity can be made consistent by assuming that quantum systems source or are classically affected by a gravitational field only when they undergo certain non-gravitational interactions that give rise to environment-induced decoherence. When systems are not affected by this decoherence-inducing process, they do not source a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of these interactions in a region, spacetime may be flat. We argue that this can be tested by investigating the gravitational field sourced by quasi-isolated systems and the absence of gravity-mediated entanglement in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment, providing distinct predictions. We propose a possible kind of decoherence-inducing interactions that give rise to gravity, which involve chains of causally ordered non-gravitational localized interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that we call Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). SDCs obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. We argue that these SDCs provide additional benefits, such as a semiclassical estimate of the value of the cosmological constant, the prediction of a time-varying cosmological constant that weakens with time, in agreement with some of the recent evidence, and a proposal about how SDCs give rise to gravity.</description>

      <title>Resonant Valance Bond Ground States on Corner-sharing Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has recently been shown to have resonant valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. The two results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. We make the first step towards unifying them by studying the quasi-1D lattice of a pyrochlore stripe, where all corners are not shared between two tetrahedra, and the valence bond configurations are not fixed by the location of the vacancy. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Thermalization of a Localized Chain Interacting with an Ergodic Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of many-body localized (MBL) phases intrinsically links spectral properties with eigenstate characteristics: localized systems exhibit Poisson level statistics and area-law entanglement entropy, while ergodic systems display volume-law entanglement and follow random matrix theory predictions, including level repulsion. Here, we introduce the interacting Anderson Quantum Sun model, which significantly deviates from these conventional expectations. In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg-atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field and, in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Quantum steering and discord in hyperon-antihyperon system in electron-positron annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in high-energy electron-positron annihilation are promising systems for the study of quantum information properties. In this work, we make an analysis of two types of quantum correlations, the quantum steering and discord, in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation based on the $X$-shaped spin density matrix. The behaviors of these quantum correlations differ from those in elementary particle-antiparticle systems such as the top quark and tau lepton due to the polarization effect. The hierarchy of quantum correlations is examined and partially confirmed in hyperon-antihyperon systems: $ \textrm{Bell Nonlocality} \subset \textrm{Steering} \subset \textrm{Entanglement} \subset \text{Discord}$. The loopholes and quantum decoherence effect are also discussed in our work.</description>

      <title>A heat-resilient hole spin qubit in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Computing and Nuclear Structure: Atomic Nuclei on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear many-body systems on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting ground states of oxygen, calcium, and nickel isotopes. By combining a hard-core-boson representation of the nuclear shell model with a pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles ansatz, we achieve sub-percent relative error in the ground-state energies compared to noise-free statevector simulations. Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Spectral Edge in SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the continuous spectrum at the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the power-law behaviour of the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</description>

      <title>Universality in Ionic Three-body Systems Near an Ion-atom Feshbach Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate bound and scattering properties of a system of two neutral atoms and an ion near an atom-ion Feshbach resonance. Our results indicate that long-range atom-ion interactions lead to significant deviations from universal behavior derived from contact or van der Waals potentials. We find that ionic systems display an overall suppression of inelastic transitions leading to recombination rates and lifetimes of Efimov state orders of magnitude smaller with respect to those for neutral atoms. We further characterize the dense spectra of triatomic molecular ions with extended lifetimes. Our results provide a deeper insight on the universality and structure of three-body ionic systems and establishing them as a promising platform for exploring novel few- and many-body phenomena with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</description>
