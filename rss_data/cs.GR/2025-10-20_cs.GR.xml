      <title>Fix False Transparency by Noise Guided Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.</description>

      <title>GaussGym: An open-source real-to-sim framework for learning locomotion from pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for photorealistic robot simulation that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting as a drop-in renderer within vectorized physics simulators such as IsaacGym. This enables unprecedented speed -- exceeding 100,000 steps per second on consumer GPUs -- while maintaining high visual fidelity, which we showcase across diverse tasks. We additionally demonstrate its applicability in a sim-to-real robotics setting. Beyond depth-based sensing, our results highlight how rich visual semantics improve navigation and decision-making, such as avoiding undesirable regions. We further showcase the ease of incorporating thousands of environments from iPhone scans, large-scale scene datasets (e.g., GrandTour, ARKit), and outputs from generative video models like Veo, enabling rapid creation of realistic training worlds. This work bridges high-throughput simulation and high-fidelity perception, advancing scalable and generalizable robot learning. All code and data will be open-sourced for the community to build upon.

      <title>Compressive Modeling and Visualization of Multivariate Scientific Data using Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extensive adoption of Deep Neural Networks has led to their increased utilization in challenging scientific visualization tasks. Recent advancements in building compressed data models using implicit neural representations have shown promising results for tasks like spatiotemporal volume visualization and super-resolution. Inspired by these successes, we develop compressed neural representations for multivariate datasets containing tens to hundreds of variables. Our approach utilizes a single network to learn representations for all data variables simultaneously through parameter sharing. This allows us to achieve state-of-the-art data compression. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate superior performance in terms of reconstructed data quality, rendering and visualization quality, preservation of dependency information among variables, and storage efficiency.</description>

      <title>Imperative vs. Declarative Programming Paradigms for Open-Universe Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current methods for generating 3D scene layouts from text predominantly follow a declarative paradigm, where a Large Language Model (LLM) specifies high-level constraints that are then resolved by a separate solver. This paper challenges that consensus by introducing a more direct, imperative approach. We task an LLM with generating a step-by-step program that iteratively places each object relative to those already in the scene. This paradigm simplifies the underlying scene specification language, enabling the creation of more complex, varied, and highly structured layouts that are difficult to express declaratively. To improve the robustness, we complement our method with a novel, LLM-free error correction mechanism that operates directly on the generated code, iteratively adjusting parameters within the program to resolve collisions and other inconsistencies. In forced-choice perceptual studies, human participants overwhelmingly preferred our imperative layouts, choosing them over those from two state-of-the-art declarative systems 82% and 94% of the time, demonstrating the significant potential of this alternative paradigm. Finally, we present a simple automated evaluation metric for 3D scene layout generation that correlates strongly with human judgment.</description>

      <title>SPICE: A Synergistic, Precise, Iterative, and Customizable Image Editing Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt-based models have demonstrated impressive prompt-following capability at image editing tasks. However, the models still struggle with following detailed editing prompts or performing local edits. Specifically, global image quality often deteriorates immediately after a single editing step. To address these challenges, we introduce SPICE, a training-free workflow that accepts arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios, accurately follows user requirements, and consistently improves image quality during more than 100 editing steps, while keeping the unedited regions intact. By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. On a challenging realistic image-editing dataset, SPICE quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is consistently preferred by human annotators. We release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to support further research and artistic exploration.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Adaptation of Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Processing visual data often involves small adjustments or sequences of changes, e.g., image filtering, surface smoothing, and animation. While established graphics techniques like normal mapping and video compression exploit redundancy to encode such small changes efficiently, the problem of encoding small changes to neural fields -- neural network parameterizations of visual or physical functions -- has received less attention. We propose a parameter-efficient strategy for updating neural fields using low-rank adaptations (LoRA). LoRA, a method from the parameter-efficient fine-tuning LLM community, encodes small updates to pre-trained models with minimal computational overhead. We adapt LoRA for instance-specific neural fields, avoiding the need for large pre-trained models and yielding lightweight updates. We validate our approach with experiments in image filtering, geometry editing, video compression, and energy-based editing, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility for representing neural field updates.</description>

      <title>ROI-GS: Interest-based Local Quality 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by $\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>LayerCraft: Enhancing Text-to-Image Generation with CoT Reasoning and Layered Object Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has made remarkable progress, yet existing systems still lack intuitive control over spatial composition, object consistency, and multi-step editing. We present $\textbf{LayerCraft}$, a modular framework that uses large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to orchestrate structured, layered image generation and editing. LayerCraft supports two key capabilities: (1) $\textit{structured generation}$ from simple prompts via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling it to decompose scenes, reason about object placement, and guide composition in a controllable, interpretable manner; and (2) $\textit{layered object integration}$, allowing users to insert and customize objects -- such as characters or props -- across diverse images or scenes while preserving identity, context, and style. The system comprises a coordinator agent, the $\textbf{ChainArchitect}$ for CoT-driven layout planning, and the $\textbf{Object Integration Network (OIN)}$ for seamless image editing using off-the-shelf T2I models without retraining. Through applications like batch collage editing and narrative scene generation, LayerCraft empowers non-experts to iteratively design, customize, and refine visual content with minimal manual effort. Code will be released at https://github.com/PeterYYZhang/LayerCraft.</description>

      <title>Capture, Canonicalize, Splat: Zero-Shot 3D Gaussian Avatars from Unstructured Phone Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic, identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This "Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured photos.</description>
