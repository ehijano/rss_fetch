      <title>Osculatory Dynamics: Framework for the Analysis of Oscillatory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intractable phase dynamics often challenge our understanding of complex oscillatory systems, hindering the exploration of synchronisation, chaos, and emergent phenomena across diverse fields. We introduce a novel conceptual framework for phase analysis, using the osculating circle to construct a co-moving coordinate system, which allows us to define a unique phase of the system. This coordinate independent, geometrical technique allows dissecting intricate local phase dynamics, even in regimes where traditional methods fail. Our methodology enables the analysis of a wider range of complex systems which were previously deemed intractable.</description>

      <title>Effects of Internal Resonance and Damping on Koopman Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) of a system comprising of two coupled Duffing oscillators, with one oscillator being grounded and with the coupling being both linear and nonlinear. The study utilizes the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator and validates their connection with the Shaw-Piere invariant manifold framework for NNMs. Furthermore, the study delves into the impact of internal resonance and dissipation on the accuracy of this framework by defining a continuous quantitative measure for internal resonance. The applicability and robustness of the framework for the systems which are very similar qualitatively to that of an ENO, are also observed and discussed about the limitations of the approximation technique.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Computational Efficiency in Multiscale Systems Using Deep Learning of Coordinates and Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often show macroscopic coherent behavior due to the interactions of microscopic agents like molecules, cells, or individuals in a population with their environment. However, simulating such systems poses several computational challenges during simulation as the underlying dynamics vary and span wide spatiotemporal scales of interest. To capture the fast-evolving features, finer time steps are required while ensuring that the simulation time is long enough to capture the slow-scale behavior, making the analyses computationally unmanageable. This paper showcases how deep learning techniques can be used to develop a precise time-stepping approach for multiscale systems using the joint discovery of coordinates and flow maps. While the former allows us to represent the multiscale dynamics on a representative basis, the latter enables the iterative time-stepping estimation of the reduced variables. The resulting framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy while incurring lesser computational costs. We demonstrate this ability of the proposed scheme on the large-scale Fitzhugh Nagumo neuron model and the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation in the chaotic regime.</description>

      <title>Recovery of synchronized oscillations on multiplex networks by tuning dynamical time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneity among interacting dynamical systems or in the pattern of interactions observed in real complex systems, often lead to partially synchronized states like chimeras or oscillation suppressed states like inhomogeneous or homogeneous steady states. In such cases, recovering synchronized oscillations back is required in many applications but is a real challenge. We present how synchronized oscillations can be restored by tuning the dynamical time scales of the system. For this we use the model of a multiplex network where first layer of coupled oscillators is multiplexed with an environmental layer that can generate various possible chimera states and suppressed states. We show that by tuning the time scale mismatch between the layers , we can revive synchronized oscillations in both layers from these states. We analyse the nature of the transition to synchronization and the results are verified for two- and three-layer multiplex networks.</description>

      <title>Dissipative chaos and steady state of open Tavis-Cummings dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled atom-photon system described by the Tavis-Cummings dimer (two coupled cavities) in the presence of photon loss and atomic pumping, to investigate the quantum signature of dissipative chaos. The appropriate classical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying different dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the chaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum fluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing, resulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state exhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the chaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of chaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close connection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Influence of fluid rheology on multistability in the unstable flow of polymer solutions through pore constriction arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse chemical, energy, environmental, and industrial processes involve the flow of polymer solutions in porous media. The accumulation and dissipation of elastic stresses as the polymers are transported through the tortuous, confined pore space can lead to the development of an elastic flow instability above a threshold flow rate. This flow instability can generate complex flows with strong spatiotemporal fluctuations, despite the low Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$); for example, in 1D ordered arrays of pore constrictions, this unstable flow can be multistable, with distinct pores exhibiting distinct unstable flow states. Here, we examine how this multistability is influenced by fluid rheology. Through experiments using diverse polymer solutions having systematic variations in fluid shear-thinning or elasticity, in pore constriction arrays of varying geometries, we show that the onset of multistability can be described using a single dimensionless parameter. This parameter, the streamwise Deborah number, compares the stress relaxation time of the polymer solution to the time required for the fluid to be advected between pore constrictions. Our work thus helps to deepen understanding of the influence of fluid rheology on elastic instabilities, helping to establish guidelines for the rational design of polymeric fluids with desirable flow behaviors.</description>

      <title>Orbital cluster-based network modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel reduced-order methodology to describe complex multi-frequency fluid dynamics from time-resolved snapshot data. Starting point is the Cluster-based Network Model (CNM) thanks to its fully automatable development and human interpretability. Our key innovation is to model the transitions from cluster to cluster much more accurately by replacing snapshot states with short-term trajectories ("orbits") over multiple clusters, thus avoiding nonphysical intra-cluster diffusion in the dynamic reconstruction. The proposed orbital CNM (oCNM) employs functional clustering to coarse-grain the short-term trajectories. Specifically, different filtering techniques, resulting in different temporal basis expansions, demonstrate the versatility and capability of the oCNM to adapt to diverse flow phenomena. The oCNM is illustrated on the Stuart-Landau oscillator and its post-transient solution with time-varying parameters to test its ability to capture the amplitude selection mechanism and multi-frequency behaviours. Then, the oCNM is applied to the fluidic pinball across varying flow regimes at different Reynolds numbers, including the periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. This orbital-focused perspective enhances the understanding of complex temporal behaviours by incorporating high-frequency behaviour into the kinematics of short-time trajectories while modelling the dynamics of the lower frequencies. In analogy to Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which marked the transition from spatial-only modes to spatio-temporal ones, this work advances from analysing temporal local states to examining piecewise short-term trajectories, or orbits. By merging advanced analytical methods, such as the functional representation of short-time trajectories with CNM, this study paves the way for new approaches to dissect the complex dynamics characterising turbulent systems.</description>

Abstract: We will study the relationship between two well-known theories, genetic evolution and random matrix theory in the context of many-body systems. We show that the time evolution of certain quantum mechanical toy models is similar to that of a living cell. It is also suggested that genetic evolution can be described by a random matrix theory with statistical distribution in which natural selection acts as a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of chaotic relaxation processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The established thermodynamic formalism of chaotic dynamics, valid at statistical equilibrium, is here generalized to systems out of equilibrium, that have yet to relax to a steady state. A relation between information, escape rate, and the phase-space average of an integrated observable (e.g. Lyapunov exponent, diffusion coefficient) is obtained for finite time. Most notably, the thermodynamic treatment may predict the phase-space profile of any finite-time integrated observable from the leading and subleading eigenfunctions of the Perron-Frobenius/Koopman transfer operator. Examples of that equivalence are shown, and the theory is tested analytically on the Bernoulli map, while numerically on the perturbed cat map, the H\'enon map, and the Ikeda map, all paradigms of chaos.</description>

      <title>Extracting Equations of Motion from Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01926v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternative computing paradigms open the door to exploiting recent innovations in computational hardware to probe the fundamental thermodynamic limits of information processing. One such paradigm employs superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to execute classical computations. This, though, requires constructing sufficiently complex superconducting circuits that support a suite of useful information processing tasks and storage operations, as well as understanding these circuits' energetics. First-principle circuit design, though, leads to prohibitive algebraic complications when deriving the effective equations of motion -- complications that to date have precluded achieving these goals, let alone doing so efficiently. We circumvent these complications by (i) specializing our class of circuits and physical operating regimes, (ii) synthesizing existing derivation techniques to suit these specializations, and (iii) implementing solution-finding optimizations which facilitate physically interpreting circuit degrees of freedom that respect physically-grounded constraints. This leads to efficient, practical circuit prototyping and access to scalable circuit architectures. The analytical efficiency is demonstrated by reproducing the potential energy landscape generated by the quantum flux parametron (QFP). We then show how inductively coupling two QFPs produces a device that is capable of executing 2-bit computations via its composite potential energy landscape. More generally, the synthesis methods detailed here provide a basis for constructing universal logic gates and investigating their thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>A class of 2 X 2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of 2 X 2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions that are imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present model, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2 X 2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues.</description>
