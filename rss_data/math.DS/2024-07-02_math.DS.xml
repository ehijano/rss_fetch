      <title>Minimum Reduced-Order Models via Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the sparsity of data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we analyze an efficient approach to identifying skillful ROMs with a sparse structure using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. The causation entropy quantifies in a statistical way the additional contribution of each term to the underlying dynamics beyond the information already captured by all the other terms in the ansatz. By doing so, the causation entropy assesses the importance of each term to the dynamics before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. Thus, the approach can be utilized to eliminate terms with little dynamic impact, leading to a parsimonious structure that retains the essential physics. To circumvent the difficulty of estimating high-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) involved in the causation entropy computation, we leverage Gaussian approximations for such PDFs, which are demonstrated to be sufficient even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian dynamics. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by building sparse causation-based ROMs for various purposes, such as recovering long-term statistics and inferring unobserved dynamics via data assimilation with partial observations.</description>

      <title>Rigid-Recurrent Sequences for Actions of Finite Exponent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is to better understand the coexistence of rigidity, weak mixing, and recurrence by constructing thin sets in the product of countably many copies of the finite cyclic group of order q. A Kronecker-type set K is a subset of this group on which every continuous function into the complex unit circle equals the restriction, to K, of a character in the group's Pontryagin dual. Ackelsberg proves that if, for all q &gt; 1, there exists a perfect Kronecker-type set generating a dense subgroup, then there exist large rigidity sequences for weak mixing systems of actions by countable discrete abelian groups. Ackelsberg shows the existence of such sets for prime values of q, while we construct them for all q &gt; 1.</description>

      <title>The convergence and uniqueness of a discrete-time nonlinear Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the convergence and uniqueness of a general discrete-time nonlinear Markov chain with specific conditions. The results have important applications in discrete differential geometry. First, on a general finite weighted graph, we prove the discrete-time Ollivier Ricci curvature flow $d_{n+1}\coloneqq(1-\alpha\kappa_{d_{n}})d_{n}$ converges to a constant curvature metric. Then the author in \cite[Theorem 5.1]{M23} proved a Laplacian separation principle on a locally finite graph with non-negative Ollivier curvature. Here we prove the Laplacian separation flow converges to the constant Laplacian solution and generalize the result to nonlinear $p$-Laplace operators. Moreover, our results can also be applied to study the long-time behavior in the nonlinear Dirichlet forms theory and nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. At last, we define the Ollivier Ricci curvature of nonlinear Markov chain which is consistent with the classical Ollivier Ricci curvature, sectional curvature \cite{CMS24}, coarse Ricci curvature on hypergraphs \cite{IKTU21} and the modified Ollivier Ricci curvature for $p$-Laplace. And we prove the convergence results for the nonlinear Markov chain with nonnegative Ollivier Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of delayed complex balanced reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider delayed chemical reaction networks with generalized kinetics of product form and show that complex balancing implies that within each positive stoichiometric compatibility class there is a unique positive equilibrium that is locally asymptotically stable relative to its class. The main tools of the proofs are respectively a version of the well-known classical logarithmic Lyapunov function applied to kinetic systems and its generalization to the delayed case as a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Finally, we demonstrate our results through illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Cantor Set Structure of the Weak Stability Boundary for Infinitely Many Cycles in the Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of the weak stability boundary region for the planar restricted three-body problem about the secondary mass point has been an open problem. Previous studies have conjectured that it may have a fractal structure. In this paper, this region is studied for infinitely many cycles about the secondary mass point, instead of a finite number studied previously. It is shown that in this case the boundary consists of a family of infinitely many Cantor sets and is thus fractal in nature. It is also shown that on two-dimensional surfaces of section, it is the boundary of a region only having bounded cycling motion for infinitely many cycles, while the complement of this region generally has unbounded motion. It is shown that that this shares many properties of a Mandelbrot set. Its relationship to the non-existence of KAM tori is described, among many other properties. Applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Myrberg Limit Sets and Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan Measures for Certain Manifolds without Conjugate Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify the strong relationship between Myrberg type dynamics and the ergodic properties of the geodesic flows on (not necessarily compact) uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points. We prove that the positivity of the Patterson-Sullivan measure of the Myrberg limit set is equivalent to the conservativity of the geodesic flow with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. Moreover we show that the Myrberg limit set is a full Patterson-Sullivan measure subset of the conical limit set.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{a_n(x)\}_{n\geq1}$ be the sequence of digits of $x\in(0,1)$ in infinite iterated function systems with polynomial decay of the derivative. We first study the multifractal spectrum of the convergence exponent defined by the sequence of the digits $\{a_n(x)\}_{n\geq1}$ and the weighted products of distinct digits with finite numbers respectively, and then calculate the Hausdorff dimensions of the intersection of sets defined by the convergence exponent of the weighted product of distinct digits with finite numbers and sets of points whose digits are non-decreasing in such iterated function systems.</description>

      <title>Existence of Discrete Traveling Waves in Fully Coupled Network of Mackey-Glass Relay Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fully coupled network of Mackey-Glass generators is considered. Each generator is described by a limit equation for the Mackey-Glass equation. The right parts are represented by a relay function obtained when the exponent in the denominator of the nonlinearity tends to infinity. Discrete traveling waves are sought in the system. These modes are such that all components are represented by the same periodic function with successive (multiple of the same value) shifts. Moreover, this periodic function has the smallest number of switchings, that is, points at which the right-hand sides change the analytical form. It is shown that discrete traveling waves coexist in the system. Moreover, their number is equal to the factorial of the number of generators.</description>

      <title>Co-evolving networks for opinion and social dynamics in agent-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of digital social media has strengthened the coevolution of public opinions and social interactions, that shape social structures and collective outcomes in increasingly complex ways. Existing literature often explores this interplay as a one-directional influence, focusing on how opinions determine social ties within adaptive networks. However, this perspective overlooks the intrinsic dynamics driving social interactions, which can significantly influence how opinions form and evolve. In this work, we address this gap, by introducing the co-evolving opinion and social dynamics using stochastic agent-based models. Agents' mobility in a social space is governed by both their social and opinion similarity with others. Similarly, the dynamics of opinion formation is driven by the opinions of agents in their social vicinity. We analyze the underlying social and opinion interaction networks and explore the mechanisms influencing the appearance of emerging phenomena, like echo chambers and opinion consensus. To illustrate the model's potential for real-world analysis, we apply it to General Social Survey data on political identity and public opinion regarding governmental issues. Our findings highlight the model's strength in capturing the coevolution of social connections and individual opinions over time.</description>

      <title>Effects of Internal Resonance and Damping on Koopman Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) of a system comprising of two coupled Duffing oscillators, with one oscillator being grounded and with the coupling being both linear and nonlinear. The study utilizes the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator and validates their connection with the Shaw-Piere invariant manifold framework for NNMs. Furthermore, the study delves into the impact of internal resonance and dissipation on the accuracy of this framework by defining a continuous quantitative measure for internal resonance. The applicability and robustness of the framework for the systems which are very similar qualitatively to that of an ENO, are also observed and discussed about the limitations of the approximation technique.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Basset history term for Lagrangian particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>Metric-Entropy Limits on Nonlinear Dynamical System Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the fundamental limits of nonlinear dynamical system learning from input-output traces. Specifically, we show that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of learning nonlinear systems that satisfy a Lipschitz property and forget past inputs fast enough in a metric-entropy optimal manner. As the sets of sequence-to-sequence maps realized by the dynamical systems we consider are significantly more massive than function classes generally considered in deep neural network approximation theory, a refined metric-entropy characterization is needed, namely in terms of order, type, and generalized dimension. We compute these quantities for the classes of exponentially-decaying and polynomially-decaying Lipschitz fading-memory systems and show that RNNs can achieve them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We push forward the study of higher dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology by establishing two non-density results. First, we prove that stable hypersurfaces are not $C^2$-dense in any isotopy class of embedded hypersurfaces on any ambient symplectic manifold of dimension $2n\geq 8$. Our second result is that on any manifold of dimension $2m+1\geq 5$, the set of non-degenerate stable Hamiltonian structures is not $C^2$-dense among stable Hamiltonian structures in any given stable homotopy class that satisfies a mild assumption. The latter generalizes a result by Cieliebak and Volkov to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces from conformal transformations and some of its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of two classes of Lie-Hamilton systems on the Euclidean plane to two-dimensional curved spaces, leading to novel Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian spaces (flat $2$-torus, product of hyperbolic lines, sphere and hyperbolic plane), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as to semi-Riemannian spaces (Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes). The vector fields, Hamiltonian functions, symplectic form and constants of the motion of the Euclidean classes are recovered by a contraction process. The construction is based on the structure of certain subalgebras of the so-called conformal algebras of the two-dimensional Cayley-Klein spaces. These curved Lie-Hamilton classes allow us to generalize naturally the Riccati, Kummer-Schwarz and Ermakov equations on the Euclidean plane to curved spaces, covering both the Riemannian and Lorentzian possibilities, and where the curvature can be considered as an integrable deformation parameter of the initial Euclidean system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1510.00043v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The invariant class under parabolic and near-parabolic renormalizations constructed by Inou and Shishikura has been proved to be extremely useful in recent years. It leads to several important progresses on the dynamics of certain holomorphic maps with critical points of local degree two. In this paper, we construct a new class consisting of holomorphic maps with critical points of local degree three which is invariant under parabolic and near-parabolic renormalizations. As potential applications, some results of cubic unicritical polynomials can be obtained similarly as the quadratic case. For example, the existence of cubic unicritical Julia sets with positive area, the characterizations of the topology and geometry of cubic irrationally indifferent attractors etc.</description>

      <title>The Manhattan curve, ergodic theory of topological flows and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every non-elementary hyperbolic group, we introduce the Manhattan curve associated to any pair of left-invariant hyperbolic metrics which are quasi-isometric to a word metric. It is convex; we show that it is continuously differentiable and moreover is a straight line if and only if the corresponding two metrics are roughly similar, i.e., they are within bounded distance after multiplying by a positive constant. Further, we prove that the Manhattan curve associated to two strongly hyperbolic metrics is twice continuously differentiable. The proof is based on the ergodic theory of topological flows associated to general hyperbolic groups and analyzing the multifractal structure of Patterson-Sullivan measures. We exhibit some explicit examples including a hyperbolic triangle group and compute the exact value of the mean distortion for pairs of word metrics.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex networked systems in fields such as physics, biology, and social sciences often involve interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise ones. Hypergraphs serve as powerful modeling tools for describing and analyzing the intricate behaviors of systems with multi-body interactions. Herein, we investigate a discrete-time nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions: an underlying hypergraph, comprising triples as hyperedges, delineates the structure of these interactions, while the vertices update their states through a weighted, state-dependent average of neighboring pairs' states. This dynamics captures reinforcing group effects, such as peer pressure, and exhibits higher-order dynamical effects resulting from a complex interplay between initial states, hypergraph topology, and nonlinearity of the update. Differently from linear averaging dynamics on graphs with two-body interactions, this model does not converge to the average of the initial states but rather induces a shift. By assuming random initial states and by making some regularity and density assumptions on the hypergraph, we prove that the dynamics converges to a multiplicatively-shifted average of the initial states, with high probability. We further characterize the shift as a function of two parameters describing the initial state and interaction strength, as well as the convergence time as a function of the hypergraph structure.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Fourier decay and a cocycle version of Dolgopyat's method for self conformal measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every self conformal measure with respect to a $C^2 (\mathbb{R})$ IFS $\Phi$ has polynomial Fourier decay under some mild and natural non-linearity conditions. In particular, every such measure has polynomial decay if $\Phi$ is $C^\omega (\mathbb{R})$ and contains a non-affine map.
  A key ingredient in our argument is a cocycle version of Dolgopyat's method, that does not require the cylinder covering of the attractor to be a Markov partition. It is used to obtain spectral gap-type estimates for the transfer operator, which in turn imply a renewal theorem with an exponential error term in the spirit of Li (2022).</description>

      <title>Topological Factoring of Zero Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every topological factoring between two zero dimensional dynamical systems can be represented by a sequence of morphisms between the levels of the associated ordered Bratteli diagrams. Conversely, we will prove that given an ordered Bratteli diagram $B$ with a continuous Vershik map on it, every sequence of morphisms between levels of $B$ and $C$, where $C$ is another ordered Bratteli diagram with continuous Vershik map, induces a topological factoring if and only if $B$ has a unique infinite min path. We present a method to construct various examples of ordered premorphisms between two decisive Bratteli diagrams such that the induced maps between the two Vershik systems are not topological factorings. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a topological factoring from an ordered premorphism. Expanding on the modelling of factoring, we generalize the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem to represent factor maps between two zero dimensional dynamical systems through sequences of sliding block codes.</description>

      <title>Rates in almost sure invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Almost Sure Invariance Principle (ASIP) with close to optimal error rates for nonuniformly hyperbolic maps. We do not assume exponential contraction along stable leaves, therefore our result covers in particular slowly mixing invertible dynamical systems as Bunimovich flowers, billiards with flat points as in Chernov and Zhang (2005) and Wojtkowski' (1990) system of two falling balls. For these examples, the ASIP is a new result, not covered by prior works for various reasons, notably because in absence of exponential contraction along stable leaves, it is challenging to employ the so-called Sinai's trick (Sinai 1972, Bowen 1975) of reducing a nonuniformly hyperbolic system to a nonuniformly expanding one. Our strategy follows our previous papers on the ASIP for nonuniformly expanding maps, where we build a semiconjugacy to a specific renewal Markov shift and adapt the argument of Berkes, Liu and Wu (2014). The main difference is that now the Markov shift is two-sided, the observables depend on the full trajectory, both the future and the past.</description>

Abstract: An error in the statement and proof of Theorem 7 in [D.Corona, A. Della Corte. The critical exponent functions. Comptes Rendus Math\'ematique, 360(G4), 315-332, 2022] has been identified. The theorem was used to prove analytical and dynamical properties of a class of interval maps there introduced, called the critical exponent functions. We show here that most of the properties of these maps established in [D.Corona, A. Della Corte. The critical exponent functions. Comptes Rendus Math\'ematique, 360(G4), 315-332, 2022] can be recovered with minor adjustments. Moreover, we propose as a conjecture a weaker form of Theorem 7.</description>

Abstract: We study non-expanding random walks on the space of affine lattices and establish a new classification theorem for stationary measures. Further, we prove a theorem that relates the genericity with respect to these random walks to Birkhoff genericity. Finally, we apply these theorems to obtain several results in inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation, especially on fractals.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical Bogomolov conjecture for families of split rational maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Zhang's dynamical Bogomolov conjecture holds uniformly along $1$-parameter families of rational split maps and curves. This provides dynamical analogues of recent results of Dimitrov-Gao-Habegger and K\"uhne. In fact, we prove a stronger Bogomolov-type result valid for families of split maps in the spirit of the relative Bogomolov conjecture. We thus provide first instances of a generalization of a conjecture by Baker and DeMarco to higher dimensions. Our proof contains both arithmetic and analytic ingredients. We establish a characterization of curves that are preperiodic under the action of a non-exceptional split rational endomorphism $(f,g)$ of $(\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})^2$ with respect to the measures of maximal entropy of $f$ and $g$, extending a previous result of Levin-Przytycki. We further establish a height inequality for families of split maps and varieties comparing the values of a fiber-wise Call-Silverman canonical height with a height on the base and valid for most points of a non-preperiodic variety. This provides a dynamical generalization of a result by Habegger and generalizes results of Call-Silverman and Baker to higher dimensions. In particular, we establish a geometric Bogomolov theorem for split rational maps and varieties of arbitrary dimension.</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Holes as Relativistic Systems with Kepler Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves emanating from inspiralling black hole binaries has triggered a renewed interest in the dynamics of relativistic two-body systems. The conservative part of the latter are given by Hamiltonian systems obtained from so called post-Newtonian expansions of the general relativistic description of black hole binaries. In this paper we study the general question of whether there exist relativistic binaries that display Kepler-like dynamics with elliptical orbits. We show that an orbital equivalence to the Kepler problem indeed exists for relativistic systems with a Hamiltonian of a Kepler-like form. This form is realised by extremal black holes with electric charge and scalar hair to at least first order in the post-Newtonian expansion for arbitrary mass ratios and to all orders in the post-Newtonian expansion in the test-mass limit of the binary. Moreover, to fifth post-Newtonian order, we show that Hamiltonians of the Kepler-like form can be related explicitly through a canonical transformation and time reparametrization to the Kepler problem, and that all Hamiltonians conserving a Laplace-Runge-Lenz-like vector are related in this way to Kepler.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies bounded conditions on curvature tensors. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Stability is not open or generic in symplectic four-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an embedded stable hypersurface in a four-dimensional symplectic manifold, we prove that it is stable isotopic to a $C^0$-close stable hypersurface with the following property: $C^\infty$-nearby hypersurfaces are generically unstable. This shows that the stability property is neither open nor generic, independently of the isotopy class of hypersurfaces and ambient symplectic manifold. The proof combines tools from stable Hamiltonian topology with techniques in three-dimensional dynamics such as partial sections, integrability and KAM theory. On our way, we establish non-density properties of Reeb-like flows and a generic non-integrability theorem for cohomologous Hamiltonian structures and volume-preserving fields in dimension three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A methodology for deriving dual variational principles for the classical Newtonian mechanics of mass points in the presence of applied forces, interaction forces, and constraints, all with a general dependence on particle velocities and positions, is presented. Methods for incorporating constraints are critically assessed. General theory, as well as explicitly worked out variational principles for a dissipative system (due to Lorenz) and a system with anholonomic constraints (due to Pars) are demonstrated. Conditions under which a (family of) dual Hamiltonian flow(s), as well as a constant(s) of motion, may be associated with a conservative or dissipative, and possibly constrained, primal system naturally emerge in this work.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets): A Data-Driven Approach for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to describe relevant phenomena in dynamical systems. In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for this kind of problems. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original problem space. PIBI-Nets only require points at the computational domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results. Moreover, PIBI-Nets clearly outperform PINNs in several practical settings. Exploiting elementary properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI- Nets for the Laplace and Poisson equations, both on artificial datasets and within a real-world application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.</description>

Abstract: We prove a compactness theorem for sequences of low-action punctured holomorphic curves of controlled topology, in any dimension, without imposing the typical assumption of uniformly bounded Hofer energy. In the limit, we extract a family of closed Reeb-invariant subsets. Then, we prove new structural results for the U-map in ECH and PFH, implying that such sequences exist in abundance in low-dimensional symplectic dynamics. We obtain applications to symplectic dynamics and the geometry of surfaces. First, we prove generalizations to higher genus surfaces and three-manifolds of the celebrated Le Calvez-Yoccoz theorem. Second, we show that for any closed Riemannian or Finsler surface a dense set of points have geodesics passing through them that visit different sections of the surface. Third, we prove a version of Ginzburg-G\"urel's "crossing energy bound" for punctured holomorphic curves, of arbitrary topology, in symplectizations of any dimension.</description>
