      <title>The correlated cluster mean-field approach to the frustrated Ising model on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice, considering ferromagnetic interactions between first neighbors ($J_1$) and antiferromagnetic interactions between second neighbors ($J_2$). Our analysis is based on the correlated cluster mean field theory, which is adapted to incorporate competing interactions, providing estimates for the behavior of magnetization, internal energy, entropy, specific heat, and short-range correlations of the model. Our results indicate that the transition temperature of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition decreases toward zero as the frustration maximum ($J_2/J_1 = -1/4$) is approached, and the thermodynamic quantities indicate only continuous phase transitions for $-1/4&lt;J_2/J_1 \leq 0$. The critical temperature and the nature of phase transitions provided by the correlated cluster mean-field method are in excellent agreement with very recent Monte Carlo simulations for the model. Furthermore, the specific heat exhibits a broad maximum within the PM phase under strong frustration, suggesting the onset of a correlated paramagnetic state with high entropy content at low temperatures. Therefore, our findings support that frustration not only suppresses the ferromagnetic long-range order, but also drives significant changes in the thermodynamics and short-range correlations of the model.</description>

      <title>Smearing of dynamical quantum phase transitions in dissipative free-fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Lindblad dynamics of the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) in dissipative quadratic fermion systems. Focusing on the case of gain and loss dissipation, we derive general conditions for the persistence of nonanalyticities (so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions) in the time evolution of the RLE. We show that nonanalyticities that are present in the corresponding unitary dynamics can survive under purely gain or purely loss processes, but are completely smeared out as soon as both channels are active, even if one is infinitesimally small. These results hold for generic dissipative Gaussian evolutions, and are illustrated explicitly for the quench from the N\'eel state in the tight-binding chain, as well as for the quantum Ising chain. We also show that the subtle interplay between dissipative and unitary dynamics gives rise to a nested lightcone structure in the dynamics of the RLE, even in cases where this structure is not present in the corresponding unitary evolution, due to coherent cancellations in the phase structure of the wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the general-spin Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by modelling in physics and other disciplines, such as sociology and psychology, we derive the mean field of the general-spin Ising model from the variational principle of the Gibbs free energy. The general-spin Ising model has $2k+1$ spin values, generated by $-(k-j)/k$, with $j=0,1,2\ldots,2k$, such that for $k=1$ we obtain $-1,0,1$, for example; the Hamiltonian is identical to that of the standard Ising model. The general-spin Ising model exhibits spontaneous magnetisation, similar to the standard Ising model, but with the location translated by a factor depending on the number of categories $2k+1$. We also show how the accuracy of the mean field depends on both the number of nodes and node degree, and that the hysteresis effect decreases and saturates with the number of categories $2k+1$. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Geometric decomposition of information flow: New insights into information thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a decomposition of information flow into housekeeping and excess components for autonomous bipartite systems subject to Markov jump processes. We introduce this decomposition by using the geometric structure of probability currents and the conjugate thermodynamic forces. The housekeeping component arises from the cyclic modes caused by the detailed balance violations and maintains the correlations between the two subsystems. In contrast, the excess component, is a contribution of conservative forces that alters the mutual information between the two subsystems. With this decomposition, we generalize previous results, such as the second law of information thermodynamics, the cyclic decomposition, and the information-thermodynamic extensions of thermodynamic trade-off relations.</description>

      <title>Vector Resonant Relaxation and Statistical Closure Theory. II. One-loop Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use stellar dynamics as a testbed for statistical closure theory. We focus on the process of "Vector Resonant Relaxation," a long-range, non-linear, and correlated relaxation mechanism that drives the reorientation of stellar orbital planes around a supermassive black hole. This process provides a natural setting to evaluate the predictive power of generic statistical closure schemes for dynamical correlation functions, in the fully non-linear and non-perturbative regime. We develop a numerical scheme that explicitly implements the seminal "Martin-Siggia-Rose" formalism at one-loop order via an iterative fixed-point approach, thereby improving upon the bare order from the "Direct Interaction Approximation." Using this framework, we quantitatively validate the ability of the formalism to predict (i) the two-point two-time correlation function; (ii) the renormalised three-point interaction vertex; (iii) the three-point three-time correlation function. These predictions are compared to direct measurements from numerical simulations. We conclude by discussing the limitations of this approach and presenting possible future venues.</description>

      <title>The quantum XY chain with boundary fields: finite-size gap and phase behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the finite-size one-dimensional quantum XY chain in a transverse field in the presence of boundary fields coupled with the order-parameter spin operator. We consider fields located at the chain boundaries that have the same strength and that are oppositely aligned. We derive exact expressions for the gap $\Delta$ as a function of the model parameters for large values of the chain length $L$. These results allow us to characterize the nature of the ordered phases of the model. We find a magnetic (M) phase ($\Delta \sim e^{-aL}$), a magnetic-incommensurate (MI) phase ($\Delta \sim e^{-aL} f_{MI}(L)$), a kink (K) phase ($\Delta \sim L^{-2}$), and a kink-incommensurate (KI) phase ($\Delta \sim L^{-2} f_{KI}(L)$); $f_{MI}(L)$ and $f_{KI}(L)$ are bounded oscillating functions of $L$. We also analyze the behavior along the phase boundaries. In particular, we characterize the universal crossover behavior across the K-KI phase boundary. On this boundary, the dynamic critical exponent is $z=4$, i.e., $\Delta \sim L^{-4}$ for large values of $L$.</description>

      <title>Phase transition from localization to chaos in classical many-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a dynamical phase transition in the information spreading within a classical 2D deterministic interacting many-body system. Specifically, the transition is observed in a recently introduced momentum-conserving parity check cellular automaton (MCPCA) on the square lattice. We characterize the transition using information-theoretic quantities such as the Hamming distance and the classical decorrelator. By introducing conserved local charges of the MCPCA, we show that selecting initial ensembles with specific charge values allows the system to transition from a localized information phase to a chaotic regime with ballistic information spreading. Importantly, our findings indicate that this transition is of second order, highlighting a sharp change in information spreading behavior. Furthermore, we revisit the multifractal behavior of the dynamical structure factor and show that, although present across both phases, it originates from effective local periodicities enforced by symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Metric response of relative entropy: a universal indicator of quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information-geometric origin of fidelity susceptibility and its utility as a universal probe of quantum criticality in many-body settings have been widely discussed. Here we explore the metric response of quantum relative entropy (QRE), by tracing out all but $n$ adjacent sites from the ground state of spin chains of finite length $N$, as a parameter of the corresponding Hamiltonian is varied. The diagonal component of this metric defines a susceptibility of the QRE that diverges at quantum critical points (QCPs) in the thermodynamic limit. We study two spin-$1/2$ models as examples, namely the integrable transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and a non-integrable Ising chain with three-spin interactions. We demonstrate distinct scaling behaviors for the peak of the QRE susceptibility as a function of $N$: namely a square logarithmic divergence in TFIM and a power-law divergence in the non-integrable chain. This susceptibility encodes uncertainty of entanglement Hamiltonian gradients and is also directly connected to other information measures such as Petz-R\'enyi entropies. We further show that this susceptibility diverges even at finite $N$ if the subsystem size, $n$, exceeds a certain value when the Hamiltonian is tuned to its classical limits due to the rank of the RDMs being finite; unlike the divergence associated with the QCPs which require $N \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Thermal reconstruction of chaotic quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal states are thermal with respect to a fixed Hamiltonian. How much information about this Hamiltonian can we ``bootstrap'' from the subsystems of a thermal state? We attack the problem by positioning it as a subspecies of the quantum marginal problem. In states that obey the quantum Markov property, the Petz recovery map captures the knowledge of the larger system inherent in a subsystem. We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction breaks down at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Viscous Growth Law in Bubble Coarsening: A Molecular Dynamics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kinetics of bubble coarsening in a single component Lennard-Jones fluid using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. A homogeneous high-temperature system is quenched below the critical temperature to induce the nucleation and growth of vapor bubbles within a dense liquid matrix. The structural evolution is characterized by two point correlation functions and the static structure factor, both of which exhibit dynamic scaling and sharp interfaces consistent with Porod law. The time-dependent characteristic length scale, extracted from the correlation function, shows a robust power law growth $\ell(t) \sim t^{\alpha}$. Finite size scaling analysis across different system sizes yields $\alpha \approx 1.0$, establishing that coarsening is dominated by viscous hydrodynamic interactions rather than classical diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening predicted by the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory. These results provide atomistic evidence for fluid flow controlled coarsening in vapor-liquid systems and emphasize the need to go beyond diffusion-based theories to describe bubble dynamics in dense fluids.</description>

      <title>Bananas for Tonks' gas: structural transitions in bent-core molecule bi-layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of particle geometry in the ordering of bilayers of bent-core particles using a simplified two-dimensional model. Particles are confined to two parallel one-dimensional layers and can adopt only two discrete orientations of their bent cores. By mapping the system exactly onto a pair of coupled Ising chains in the thermodynamic limit, we may obtain closed-form expressions for all correlation functions. The coupling between orientational and layer degrees of freedom produces remarkably rich behaviour, including crossovers between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orientational order, and states with polarised layers. Despite its simplicity, this exactly soluble model reproduces qualitative features of bent-core smectic liquid crystals and confined colloids, providing insight into the subtle role of particle geometry in driving structural correlations.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics and superconducting state preparation in the quenched Kitaev chain with pairing imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical balance of the pairing term plays a crucial role in the emergence of topological superconductivity in the p-wave spinless Kitaev chain, particularly in the non-Hermitian regime. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes.</description>

      <title>Emergent Isotropic-Nematic Transition in 3D Semiflexible Active Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filament collectives, ranging from motor-driven cytoskeletal filaments to slender organisms such as cyanobacteria and worm aggregates, abound in nature, yet how activity and flexibility jointly govern their organization, especially Isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition, remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of 3D active semiflexible polymers with varying flexibility degrees, we show that tangential active forces systematically shift the I-N transition to higher densities, with the shift controlled by the flexibility degree and activity strength. Strikingly, activity alters the nature of the transition: discontinuous at low strengths, continuous at moderate strengths, and ultimately suppressed at high activity levels. At high densities, this suppression generates an active nematic state, sustained by continuous defect creation and annihilation but lacking global order. The delayed I-N transition originates from enhanced collective bending fluctuations, which reduce the effective persistence length and enlarge the effective confinement tube. At moderate activity levels, these fluctuations trigger large-scale excitations that stochastically drive temporal transitions between nematic and isotropic states. We summarize this behavior in non-equilibrium state diagrams of density and activity for different flexibility degrees.</description>

      <title>Fast mixing of operator-loop path-integral quantum Monte Carlo for stoquastic XY Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo method with operator-loop update is a powerful technique that has been extensively used with great success in condensed matter physics. It enables one to sample from thermal and ground states of local Hamiltonians of various spin, bosonic and fermionic systems as long as the Hamiltonian does not have a negative-sign problem. Despite the practical success of this method, theoretical understanding of the efficiency of the algorithm has been lacking. The operator-loop update is commonly used for path-integral formulation (Suzuki-Trotter/world-lines) of the partition function. In this work we consider this method applied to the stoquastic (sign-problem free) XY model and prove that the mixing time of the Markov chain is polynomial in the system size and the inverse temperature. Using the fast mixing Markov chain, we can estimate the partition functions of the Hamiltonians that we consider in a polynomial time, significantly improving upon the best known previous algorithm by Bravyi and Gosset [arXiv:1612.05602]. Our algorithm also allows for natural extensions to a wide class of empirically fast-mixing Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replicating efficient and adaptable microbial navigation strategies, such as run and tumble (RnT) and tactic motions to synthetic active agents has been an enduring quest. To this end, we introduce a stochastic orientational reset (SOR) protocol, in which the propulsion direction of an active Brownian particle (ABP) is reassigned to a random orientation within a defined reset-cone. When the reset-cone is aligned with the instantaneous propulsion direction, ABPs reproduce the RnT dynamics of E. coli; when set along an attractant gradient, they exhibit taxis - with extensive adaptability in persistence through the angular width of the reset-cone and reset rate. We establish the robustness of this protocol across a broad range of swimming speeds using experiments, simulations, and analytical theory.</description>

      <title>Universal Model of Urban Street Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing 9,000 urban areas' street networks, we identify properties, including extreme betweenness centrality heterogeneity, that typical spatial network models fail to explain. Accordingly we propose a universal, parsimonious, generative model based on a two-step mechanism that begins with a spanning tree as a backbone then iteratively adds edges to match empirical degree distributions. Controlled by a single parameter representing lattice-equivalent node density, it accurately reproduces key universal properties to bridge the gap between empirical observations and generative models.</description>

      <title>Introduction of modelling radical pair quantum spin dynamics with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Effects in Quantum Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian for the massless Dirac field on a segment with an inhomogeneous background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of an interval for the massless Dirac field in an inhomogeneous background on a segment where the same boundary condition at both its endpoints is imposed, and in its ground state. We focus on a class of metrics that are Weyl equivalent to the flat metric through a Weyl factor that depends only on the spatial coordinate. The explicit form of the entanglement Hamiltonian is written as the sum of a local and a bilocal term. The weight function of the local term allows us to study a contour function for the entanglement entropies. For the model obtained from the continuum limit of the rainbow chain, the analytic expressions are compared with exact numerical results from the lattice, showing an excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a holographic model of defect conformal field theories (DCFTs) with defects of codimension greater than one. Our construction generalizes the AdS/BCFT model by anchoring the end-of-the-world brane on defects at the asymptotic AdS boundary and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions for the metric on the brane. We compute the defect entropy and defect free energy and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-function is always non-negative. We further study holographic defect-localized RG flows triggered by a localized scalar field on the brane and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds. We also verify that our model reproduces the expected forms of correlation functions in DCFTs.</description>

      <title>Construction and simulability of quantum circuits with free fermions in disguise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic construction for local quantum circuits hosting free fermions in disguise, both with staircase and brickwork architectures. Similar to the original Hamiltonian model introduced by Fendley, these circuits are defined by the fact that the Floquet operator corresponding to a single time step can not be diagonalized by means of any Jordan-Wigner transformation, but still displays a free-fermionic spectrum. Our construction makes use of suitable non-local transfer matrices commuting with the Floquet operator, allowing us to establish the free fermionic spectrum. We also study the dynamics of these circuits after they are initialized in arbitrary product states, proving that the evolution of certain local observables can be simulated efficiently on classical computers. Our work proves recent conjectures in the literature and raises new questions on the classical simulability of free fermions in disguise.</description>

      <title>Toward a Physics of Deep Learning and Brains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks and brains both learn and share superficial similarities: processing nodes are likened to neurons and adjustable weights are likened to modifiable synapses. But can a unified theoretical framework be found to underlie them both? Here we show that the equations used to describe neuronal avalanches in living brains can also be applied to cascades of activity in deep neural networks. These equations are derived from non-equilibrium statistical physics and show that deep neural networks learn best when poised between absorbing and active phases. Because these networks are strongly driven by inputs, however, they do not operate at a true critical point but within a quasi-critical regime -- one that still approximately satisfies crackling noise scaling relations. By training networks with different initializations, we show that maximal susceptibility is a more reliable predictor of learning than proximity to the critical point itself. This provides a blueprint for engineering improved network performance. Finally, using finite-size scaling we identify distinct universality classes, including Barkhausen noise and directed percolation. This theoretical framework demonstrates that universal features are shared by both biological and artificial neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heisenberg model spin systems offer favourable and manageable physical settings for generating and manipulating entangled quantum states. In this work mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) Heisenberg spin trimmer with two different but isotropic Lande $g$-factors and two different exchange constants is considered. The study undertakes the task of finding the optimal parameters to create entangled states and control them by external magnetic field. The primary objective of this work is to examine the tripartite entanglement of a system and the dependence of the tripartite entanglement on various system parameters. Particularly, the effects of non-conserving magnetization are in the focus of our research. The source of non-commutativity between the magnetic moment operator and the Hamiltonian is non-uniformity of $g$-factors. To quantify the tripartite entanglement, an entanglement measure refered to as "tripartite negativity" has been used in this work.</description>

Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation--dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L032053 (2025)].Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying and characterizing fluctuations far away from equilibrium is a challenging task. We discuss and experimentally confirm a series expansion for a driven classical system, relating the different non-equilibrium cumulants of the observable conjugate to the driving protocol. This series is valid from micro- to macroscopic length scales, and it encompasses the fluctuation dissipation theorem. We apply it in experiments of a Brownian probe particle confined and driven by an optical potential and suspended in a nonlinear and non-Markovian fluid. The expansion states that the form of FDT remains valid away from equilibrium for Gaussian observables, up to the order presented. We show that this expansion agrees with the expansion of a known fluctuation theorem up to an unresolved difference regarding moments versus cumulants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1$-$J_2$ $q$-state Potts model is solved exactly for arbitrary $q$ by analytically block-diagonalizing the original $q^2\times q^2$ transfer matrix into a simple $2\times 2$ maximally symmetric subspace, based on using OpenAI's reasoning model o3-mini-high to exactly solve the $q=3$ case. Furthermore, by matching relevant subspaces, we map the Potts model onto a simpler effective 1D $q$-state Potts model, where $J_2$ acts as the nearest-neighbor interaction and $J_1$ as an effective magnetic field, nontrivially generalizing a 56-year-old theorem previously limited to the simplest case ($q=2$, the Ising model). Our exact results provide insights to phenomena such as atomic or electronic order stacking in layered materials and the emergence of dome-shaped phases in complex phase diagrams. This work is anticipated to fuel both research in 1D frustrated magnets for recently discovered finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic area of AI in science.</description>

      <title>Exact results on the hydrodynamics of certain kinetically-constrained hopping processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of interacting random walkers on a triangular chain and triangular lattice, where a particle can move only if the other two sites of the triangle are unoccupied -- a kinetically-constrained hopping process (KCHP) recently introduced in the context of non-linear diffusion cascades. Using a classical-to-quantum mapping -- where the rate matrix of the stochastic KCHP corresponds to a spin Hamiltonian, and the equilibrium probability distribution to the quantum ground state -- we develop a systematic perturbation theory to calculate the diffusion constant; the hydrodynamics of the KCHPs is determined by the low-energy properties of the spin Hamiltonian, which we analyse with the standard Holstein-Primakoff spin-wave expansion.
  For the triangular hopping we consider, we show that \textit{non-interacting} spin-wave theory predicts the \textit{exact} diffusion constant. We conjecture this holds for all KCHPs with (i) hard-core occupancy, (ii) parity-symmetry, and (iii) where the hopping processes are given by three-site gates -- that is, where hopping between two sites is conditioned on the occupancy of a third. We further show that there are corrections to the diffusion constant when the KCHP is described by \textit{four}-site gates, which we calculate at leading order in the semi-classical $1/S$ expansion. We support all these conclusions with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered phase with $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance and we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from the Schr\"odinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$ which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$ provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$ offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Exact single-time and two-time correlations and the two-time response function are found for the order-parameter in the voter model with nearest-neighbour interactions. Their explicit dynamical scaling functions are shown to be continuous functions of the space dimension $d&gt;0$. Their form reproduces the predictions of non-equilibrium representations of the Schr\"odinger algebra for models with dynamical exponent ${z}=2$ and with the dominant noise-source coming from the heat bath. Hence the ageing in the voter model is a paradigm for relaxations in non-equilibrium critical dynamics, without detailed balance, and with the upper critical dimension $d^*=2$.</description>

      <title>When is nonreciprocity relevant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions are widely observed in nonequilibrium systems, from biological or sociological dynamics to open quantum systems. Despite the ubiquity of nonreciprocity, its impact on phase transitions is not fully understood. In this work, we derive criteria to perturbatively assess whether nonreciprocity changes the universality class of pairs of asymmetrically coupled systems undergoing a phase transition. These simple criteria are stated in terms of the unperturbed critical exponents, in the spirit of the Harris criterion for disordered systems, and agree with numerical simulations. Beyond nonreciprocity, our approach provides guidelines for assessing how dynamical phase transitions are affected by perturbations.</description>

      <title>Crosscap states and duality of Ising field theory in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two distinct crosscap states for the two-dimensional (2D) Ising field theory. These two crosscap states, identifying Ising spins or dual spins (domain walls) at antipodal points, are shown to be related via the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. We derive their Majorana free field representations and extend bosonization techniques to calculate correlation functions of the 2D Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with different crosscap boundaries. Away from criticality, we develop a conformal perturbation theory to calculate the Klein bottle entropy (norm-square of the crosscap overlap) as a universal scaling function [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 151602 (2023)]. For the Ising field theory, our analytical results support the conjectured monotonicity of the Klein bottle entropy under relevant perturbations. The formalism provides a general framework for studying perturbed 2D CFTs on non-orientable manifolds.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Bringing two semi-infinite heat baths at different temperatures into thermal contact along a surface, the NESS arises at asymptotically late times as a stationary state that has modewise thermal properties and features a heat flow between the reservoirs. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the transition rate with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not couple to the heat flow, causing the detector to only register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized multimodal phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the single and bimodal phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems, and it effectively incorporates nonlocal information. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.</description>

      <title>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While previous work has studied different scaling regimes for transformers, an asymptotically exact, down-to-the constant prescription for how to initialise transformers has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through deep transformers with self-attention, layer normalisation, skip connections and MLP. Our theory yields a simple algorithm to compute trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. We overcome the key challenge, an exact treatment of the self-attention layer, by establishing a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We also analyse gradients in the backward path and determine the regime where gradients vanish at initialisation. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework through three case studies. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantee smooth training.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</description>

      <title>Learning the bulk and interfacial physics of liquid-liquid phase separation with neural density functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use simulation-based supervised machine learning and classical density functional theory to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena associated with phase coexistence in binary mixtures. For a prototypical symmetrical Lennard-Jones mixture our trained neural density functional yields accurate liquid-liquid and liquid-vapour binodals together with predictions for the variation of the associated interfacial tensions across the entire fluid phase diagram. From the latter we determine the contact angles at fluid-fluid interfaces along the line of triple-phase coexistence and confirm there can be no wetting transition in this symmetrical mixture.</description>

      <title>Average-computation benchmarking for local expectation values in digital quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations.</description>

      <title>Intuition emerges in Maximum Caliber models at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.</description>
