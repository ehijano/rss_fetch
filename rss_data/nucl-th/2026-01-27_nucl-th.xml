      <title>Quarkyonic matter with strangeness in an extended RMF model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quarkyonic matter is expected to play a key role for the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter in compact stars. Within the framework of the relativistic mean field (RMF) model and equivparticle model with density-dependent quark masses, we construct the ``quark Fermi sea" with a ``baryon Fermi surface" to characterize the properties of the quarkyonic matter. In particular, we develop a comprehensive framework to account for the strangeness degrees of freedom, incorporating $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Sigma$ hyperons as well as strange quarks in a unified quarkyonic framework. Our calculations indicate that the inevitable emergence of hyperons softens the equations of state, leading to a reduction in the speed of sound around $n_{\rm b}\approx 2n_0$, and consequently reducing the masses and radii of neutron stars. When the quark-hadron phase transition is taken into account, the equation of state at high densities exhibits additional softening, leading to a maximum sound velocity of $v_{\rm max} \approx 0.6\,c$, which is close to the ultrarelativistic limit of $0.58\,c$, consistent with current astronomical observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Two-body cluster entangled structure in the $\mathcal{H}_1\otimes \mathcal{H}_2$ Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a quantum information perspective to analyze the internal structure of atomic nuclei, focusing on the quantum entanglement between $\alpha$ clusters in the 0$^+$ state of $^8$Be. A wave function based on angular momentum coupling is developed to transform the two-cluster wave function from the conventional center of mass and relative coordinate basis ($\mathcal{H}_{R_{c.m.}} \otimes \mathcal{H}_r$) into the individual particle basis ($\mathcal{H}_1 \otimes \mathcal{H}_2$), which is essential for a precise quantification of entanglement. Within this method, the von Neumann entropy is employed to quantify the entanglement arising from the mixing of angular momentum channels. Additionally, we introduce the concept of spatially resolved entropy, which measures entanglement as a function of the radial separation between clusters. Our analysis reveals that the entanglement is strongly correlated with the spatial configuration at the femtometer scale. As the inter cluster separation vanishes, the system approaches a separable $S$-wave state, indicating that entanglement is dynamically generated during the spatial separation of the clusters. This research provides a new tool for investigating nonlocal quantum correlations in nuclear structure, complementing existing descriptions.</description>

      <title>Basis Representation for Nuclear Densities from Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an efficient method to represent nuclear densities using basis functions extracted via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Applying PCA to densities of 75 nuclei calculated with the relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory yields an orthogonal set of components that efficiently capture the dominant features of nuclear density distributions, which can be used as basis functions for nuclear density representation. The first five basis functions account for more than 99.999\% of the total variance, demonstrating the efficiency of these PCA basis functions. The PCA basis achieves significantly higher accuracy and faster convergence than the Fourier-Bessel and Sum-of-Gaussians methods for reconstructing both theoretical and experimental densities. This approach provides an efficient and robust representation of nuclear densities, offering a practical tool for experimental density representation and for theories where densities play a central role, such as the orbital-free density functional theory, or the double folding model for nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>The role of the surface energy in nuclear octupole excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Octupole excitations of atomic nuclei can be viewed as fluctuations around an equilibrium shape. These fluctuations in turn can be seen as probes of nuclear matter properties to the extent that the shape changes explore changes in compression, surface to volume ratio, or isospin overlap. In the present work we use a series of Skyrme interactions, which were fitted to provide a systematic range of surface energies, to explore the surface energy dependence of octupole excitations in $^{208}$Pb. We find a strong positive linear corelation between the surface energy of a Skyrme interaction and its prediction of the first $3^-$ octupole excitation energy.</description>

      <title>Meson-exchange currents and nuclear correlations in neutrino and electron scattering with nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is dedicated to the study of electron and neutrino scattering on nuclei, with special emphasis on meson-exchange currents (MEC) and short-range correlations (SRC) between nucleon pairs in one-particle emission processes. In chapter 2, the SuSAM* model is improved by redefining the single nucleon hadronic tensor, averaging it over a Fermi distribution instead of using the previous extrapolation from the relativistic Fermi gas. This formulation removes the inconsistency associated with negative contributions in kinematics far from the QE peak. The new definition allows extending the SuSAM* formalism to include MEC, which is the focus of chapter 3. In chapter 3, a scaling analysis of 12C data is performed incorporating MEC explicitly at the single nucleon level, leading to a new phenomenological scaling function. Using this model, the effect of MEC on EM responses is studied and compared with the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) and the relativistic mean field (RMF) models. Chapter 4 presents a detailed analysis of the interference between 1b2b in the RT. It is shown that this interference is always negative within the independent-particle approximation. Chapter 5 extends the study of MEC to the CCQE neutrino scattering within the RFG, RMF, and SuSAM* frameworks. It is found that OB-MEC interference reduces both the RT and the neutrino cross section. Chapter 6 addresses SRC in the wave function of a nucleon pair in nuclear matter. The BG equation is solved using the NN potential developed by the Granada group, allowing for the calculation of high-momentum components. Finally, chapter 7 combined the effect of MEC and SRC, which extends the FG by including the high-momentum components of nucleon pairs affected by MEC. It is found that SRC enhance the RT, in contrast with what is observed in uncorrelated models.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of fission observables investigated with a Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fission dynamics described within nuclear energy density functional frameworks (EDF) have seen substantial advances in the last decade. Part of this success stems from projection techniques, which allow the computation f probability distribution functions (pdf) for selected observables such as particle number and angular momentum of the fragments. Predicting the pdf of other observables, such as the total kinetic energy of the fragments, remains undone. This work proposes a method to determine the complete pdf of a new category of observables from a Bogoliubov vacuum projected onto good particle number. It relies on sampling nucleonic configurations in coordinate and intrinsic-spin representation. We assess the feasibility and convergence properties of the method and apply it to states representative of the scission of an actinide. Fluctuations in fragment shapes, inter-fragment Coulomb and nuclear interaction as well as the corresponding torques are analyzed. We find that a significant fraction of the fluctuation of several measured fission observables is already present within the mean-field picture.</description>

      <title>Role of the symmetry energy on hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the symmetry energy on the properties of compact stars is analyzed considering constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysics. A compact star can be a neutron star composed only of nuclear matter or a hybrid star with a quark core. Two typical models (soft and stiff) are considered for the nuclear equation of state, and for the hybrid one, a parameterized first-order phase transition approach, completed with a linear quark matter equation of state, is implemented. We show that the phase transition reduces the tension between GW170817 and NICER observations, and we illustrate the impact of the symmetry energy for the understanding of the nature of the binary system in GW170817. We also confirm our previous findings that the GW170817 waveform is best described as a binary HS with a low-density onset of stiff quark matter. This could also be interpreted as a quarkyonic cross-over.</description>

      <title>General-order degenerate coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A size-extensive, converging, black-box coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, any patterns of orbital occupancy, any spin multiplicities, and any spatial symmetries. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $\Delta$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitations only and of single and double excitations. The order of performance is: $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ EOM-CC $&gt;$ CI at the same order or $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ $\Delta$MP $&gt;$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Tomography of Flux Tubes in (2+1)D Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entangling properties of the color flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. In earlier works, we defined a gauge-invariant flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), the excess entanglement entropy of a region of gluon fields that can be attributed to the color flux tube, and demonstrated that it is finite in the continuum limit. FTE$^2$ was shown to have two contributions, one from the vibrations of the QCD string, and the other from its internal (color) degrees of freedom. In this work, we further explore the internal color component in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory for $SU(N_c)$ gauge groups, varying $2\le N_c\le5$. We identify a novel physical scale in the theory, the entanglement radius $\xi_0$. This radius characterizes the transverse extent of the flux tube that must be completely severed by an entangling region to capture the entanglement entropy of color degrees of freedom. The key feature underlying this phenomenon is its topological nature. This is revealed through systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions in which FTE$^2$ changes sharply when boundaries of the slabs completely cross-cut the flux tube. We find that $\xi_0$ increases approximately linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of both R\'{e}nyi replica number and the inter-quark separation length. We also study FTE$^2$ as a function of the entangling region's transverse displacement from the static quark pair and observe behavior consistent with a previously identified intrinsic width $\lambda$ of the flux tube, with an extracted value in agreement with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the gauge groups studied.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Dynamics of Large and Small Systems from a 3D Bayesian Calibration of RHIC Top-energy Collision Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the 3D dynamics of high-energy nuclear collisions is presented. We perform a systematic model-to-data comparison using simulations of large and small collision systems, and a broad range of measurements from the PHENIX, STAR, PHOBOS, and BRAHMS collaborations spanning nearly two decades of RHIC operations. In particular, we perform fully 3D multi-stage simulations including rapidity-dependent energy deposition with global energy conservation using the 3D Glauber model, along with relativistic viscous hydrodynamics with MUSIC. We calibrate the model on rapidity- and $p_T$-differential observables and analyze the respective constraints on initial state and transport properties they provide. We emphasize the additional constraints provided by rapidity-dependent measurements, the differences in large and small system calibrations, and the tension exhibited by particular observables. We use our calibrated model to make predictions of observables in p-Au and $^3$He-Au collisions. Furthermore, we facilitate direct comparison of experimental measurements by highlighting the dependence of flow measurements on the rapidity of the regions of interest and reference, as well as the importance of the centrality selection. In particular, we examine the apparent differences between the STAR and PHENIX $v_2$ and $v_3$ measurements in small systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical study of $\pi N\to \pi\pi N$ reactions revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Argonne National Laboratory-The University of Osaka (ANL-Osaka) DCC model of meson-nucleon reactions, we extend the study of Phys. Rev. C 79, 025206 (2009) and Phys. Rev. C 88, 045203 (2013) to predict the cross sections of the $\pi N \to \pi \pi N$ reactions. The model was constructed by fitting only the two-body reactions: $\pi N,\gamma N \to \pi N, \eta N, K\Lambda, K\Sigma$. Thus, the results for $\pi N \to \pi \pi N$ presented here are predictions of the ANL-Osaka DCC model, which serve to examine the extent to which the forthcoming data from J-PARC can be described. This study provides information for improving the extraction of nucleon resonances that have large decay widths to $\pi\pi N$ states. We present results for the total cross sections, invariant mass distributions, and angular distributions. We also identify the observables and energy regions where the higher mass nucleon resonances in the $S_{31}$, $P_{33}$, $D_{33}$, $F_{37}$, $D_{13}$, $D_{15}$, and $F_{15}$ partial waves can be most effectively investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of the production of high-spin $\omega_J$ and $\rho_J$ mesons ($J=3,4,5$) in $\pi^{-}p$ reactions using an effective Lagrangian approach. By constructing the relevant $t$-channel processes and calibrating the model with a single adjustable parameter fitted to existing data, we successfully reproduce the measured total and differential cross sections for the $J=3$ states $\omega_3(1670)$ and $\rho_3(1690)$. Within the same framework, we predict the production cross sections for the higher-spin partners $\omega_4(2250)$, $\rho_4(2230)$, $\omega_5(2250)$, and $\rho_5(2350)$. Our results show that these states exhibit measurable cross sections with characteristically forward-peaked angular distributions, underscoring their strong potential for observation in future $\pi p$ meson-beam experiments.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino interactions play a central role in transport and flavor evolution in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. Simulations suggest that neutron star mergers may produce magnetic fields as strong as $10^{17}$ G, but computational difficulties have hampered the inclusion of magnetic field effects in neutrino interaction rates. In this paper we give approximate interaction rates for neutrinos in the presence of strong magnetic fields, including the effects of Landau quantization and anomalous magnetic moments with errors of order $\sqrt{T/M}$. We also comment on a neutrino production channel from individual neutrons that can produce low-energy $\nu \bar{\nu}$ pairs even at low density.</description>

      <title>Chiral Properties of $(2\!+\!1)$-Flavor QCD in Magnetic Fields at Zero Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD study of the chiral properties of $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor QCD in background magnetic fields at zero temperature with physical pion masses. Simulations are performed using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action across four different lattice spacings to enable a controlled continuum extrapolation. We compute the renormalized chiral condensates together with pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants for pions, kaons, and the fictitious $\eta^0_{s\bar{s}}$ pseudoscalar as functions of the magnetic field strength $eB$ up to $eB\simeq1.2$ $\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The chiral condensates exhibit clear magnetic catalysis, increasing monotonically with the field strength. In the meson sector, neutral pseudoscalar masses decrease steadily with $eB$, whereas charged pseudoscalar masses display a non-monotonic response: they rise at small fields, consistent with the lowest-Landau-level expectation, but then saturate and slightly decrease at larger fields, signaling sizable internal-structure effects. At the same time, neutral pseudoscalar decay constants are strongly enhanced by the magnetic field. To quantify deviations from chiral symmetry relations, we isolate the magnetic-field-induced shift in the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner corrections, and find it to remain small for the neutral pion but to become sizable for the neutral kaon. To elucidate the origin of the magnetic response, we separately analyze the sea and valence quark contributions to both neutral and charged meson masses, finding that valence effects dominate at zero temperature. These results provide new insights into the interplay between QCD chiral symmetry breaking and strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized parton distribution functions for spin-1 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-1 hadrons contain different aspects of spin physics from the ones of the spin-1/2 nucleon because of the existence of tensor-polarized structure functions. In the charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering from a spin-1 hadron or nucleus, such as the deuteron, there are leading-twist structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. In addition, there exists a gluon transversity which does not exist in the spin-1/2 nucleon. In the deuteron, these observables could probe interesting dynamical aspects beyond a simple bound system of a proton and a neutron. In addition, there are recent theoretical studies on higher-twist distributions. Tensor-polarized deuteron experiments are now under preparation at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, so that the topic of polarized deuteron is expected to become one of exciting fields in hadron physics. This paper is a brief overview on the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions, including transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions up to twist 4.</description>

      <title>Nuclear effects on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio in the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear modifications of the nucleon's structure function $F_2^N$ have been investigated mainly since the discovery of the EMC nuclear effect in 1983, and there were many experimental measurements from the deuteron to a heavy nucleus. Now, the details of the modifications of $F_2^N$ are known from small $x$ to large $x$. On the other hand, it is taken as granted that a nuclear modification does not exist for the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$. However, such a nuclear modification does exist theoretically. A nucleon in a nucleus moves in any space direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction along the virtual-photon momentum in charged-lepton scattering. Because of this transverse Fermi motion, the longitudinal and transverse structure functions mix with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse-momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this paper, the nuclear modifications are shown numerically for the deuteron by using a standard convolution description. The magnitude of the modifications is of the order of a few percent in the deuteron; however, they should be large in large nuclei. In handling high-energy nuclear data, such nuclear modifications need to be taken into account for a precise determination of physical quantities. Now, the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio and tensor-polarized experiments are under preparation for the deuteron at JLab. We hope that such effects will be confirmed experimentally for not only for the deuteron but also for larger nuclei.</description>

      <title>First observation of multi-phonon $\gamma$-vibrations in an odd-odd nuclear system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of the first multi-phonon $\gamma$-vibrational bands in an odd-odd neutron-rich nucleus of the nuclear chart is presented. These high spin structures of hard to access $^{104}_{41}$Nb$_{63}$, produced in fission, were studied by combining a spectrometer with isotopic resolution coupled to a $\gamma$-ray tracking array and independently high-fold $\gamma$ coincidence measurements. Triaxial Projected Shell Model calculations for the high-spin states are in good agreement with the measured observables for the yrast, one-phonon and two-phonon $\gamma$ bands. The possibility of an oblate shape of an isomeric state and coexistence of triaxial and oblate configurations are investigated from the decay of the 141 keV isomer. The present work illustrates the robustness of vibration excitations in the presence of odd valence proton and neutron as well as the possibly coexisting shapes beyond the $N=60$ transitional region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy flavor production serves as an ideal probe of the hadronization mechanism of the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We study charm quark hadronization by taking Langevin equations for the charm quark transport in the medium and a sequential coalescence model for the hadronization. Since the $D_s$ formation is earlier than $D^0$, obtained from the Dirac equation with hot potential extracted from lattice QCD, the $D_s$ elliptic flow $v_2$ is smaller than the $D^0\ v_2$ in the intermediate $p_T$ region, which explains well the recent ALICE data. The sequential coalescence also predicts a hill in the yield ratio $D_s/D^0$ at low $p_T$, which can be tested in future heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity for long paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work argued that the scaling of a dimensionless quantity $Q_D$ with path length is a better proxy for quantifying the scaling of the computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity than the timescale. It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be superlinear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of light nuclei in high-energy collisions provides valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of the strong interaction and the structure of the particle-emitting source. Understanding this process is crucial not only for nuclear physics but also for astrophysical studies, where the production of rare antinuclei could serve as a probe for new physics. This work presents a three-body coalescence model based on the Wigner function formalism, offering a refined description of light-nucleus production. By incorporating realistic two- and three-body nuclear interaction potentials constrained by modern scattering and femtoscopic correlation data, our approach improves on traditional coalescence models. The framework is validated using event generators applied to proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV to predict the momentum spectra of light (anti) nuclear nuclei with mass number $A=3$, which are then compared with the experimental data from ALICE. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of light nucleus yields to the choice of nuclear wave functions, emphasizing the importance of an accurate description of the coalescence process. This model lays the foundation for the extension of coalescence studies of $A=3$ light nuclei to a wider range of collision systems and energies.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of charmonium light-front wave functions obtained through two complementary non-perturbative approaches: Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) and Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE). Key observables include the charge form factor, gravitational form factors, light-cone distribution amplitudes, decay constants, and two-photon transition form factors. Despite their distinct theoretical foundations and model parameters, the predictions from BLFQ and DSE exhibit remarkable agreement across all observables. This convergence validates both frameworks for studying charmonium structure and highlights the complementary strengths of Hamiltonian-based (BLFQ) and Lagrangian-based (DSE) methods in addressing non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the $\nu i$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

      <title>The mass of $^{101}$Sn and Bayesian extrapolations to the proton drip line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The favorable energy configurations of nuclei at magic numbers of ${N}$ neutrons and ${Z}$ protons are fundamental for understanding the evolution of nuclear structure. The ${Z=50}$ (tin) isotopic chain is a frontier for such studies, with particular interest at and around the doubly-magic \textsuperscript{100}Sn isotope, for which the mass is a topic of debate. Precise mass values for neutron-deficient isotopes provide necessary anchor points for mass models to test extrapolations near the proton drip line, where experimental studies remain out of reach. In this work, we report the first Penning trap mass measurement of \textsuperscript{101}Sn. The determined mass excess of $-59\,889.89(96)$~keV for \textsuperscript{101}Sn represents a factor of 300 improvement over the current precision and indicates that \textsuperscript{101}Sn is less bound than previously thought. Mass predictions from a recently developed Bayesian model combination (BMC) framework employing statistical machine learning and nuclear masses computed within seven global models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory (DFT) agree within 1$\sigma$ with experimental masses from the $48 \le Z \le 52$ isotopic chains. The framework's resilience to new mass data gave confidence in the extrapolation of tin masses down to $N=46$. Our calculations suggest that \textsuperscript{96}Sn is a two-proton drip line nucleus and predict a mass excess of $-58\,090(800)$~keV for $^{100}$Sn, showing a preference within 1$\sigma$ for the mass of \textsuperscript{100}Sn derived from the $\beta$-delayed $Q$-value measured at GSI.</description>

Abstract: $\gamma^* \gamma \to B \bar{B}$ is the golden process to access chiral-even di-baryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) as deeply virtual Compton scattering has proven to be for the generalized parton distributions. In the framework of colinear QCD factorization where the leading twist amplitude is the convolution of GDAs and a perturbatively calculable coefficient function, we study the scattering amplitude for the baryonic channels where $B$ is a spin $1/2$ baryon such as the nucleon or hyperon $\Lambda, \Sigma$. Taking into account the interfering QED amplitude, we calculate the cross section of the $e^\pm \gamma \to e^\pm B \bar B$ process that can be experimentally studied in $e^- e^+$ as well as in electron-ion facilities. We explore both the final state polarization summed case and the polarization dependent effects. Numerical estimates are presented for $e^- \gamma \to e^- p \bar{p}$, using motivated models for GDAs. Our results show that a first extraction of baryon-antibaryon GDAs from experimental measurements is feasible at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO BFKL impact factors for quarkonium hadroproduction in NRQCD: the case of ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading-order calculation of the impact factors for hadroproduction of the ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$, ${}^1S_0^{[8]}$, and ${}^3S_1^{[8]}$ NRQCD states within the BFKL formalism. We complete the recent virtual-correction computation presented in JHEP 12 (2024) 129 by that of the real-emission contributions. We observe the cancellation of the soft divergences between these real- and virtual-emission contributions and we note that the surviving collinear singularities are compatible with factorisation up to one loop for a novel class of processes where BFKL resummation can be applied. Our work indeed represents the first complete NLO quarkonium impact factor in the BFKL framework and paves the way to first next-to-leading-logarithmic-precision studies for hadroproduction of forward-backward quarkonium associated production at hadron colliders.</description>
