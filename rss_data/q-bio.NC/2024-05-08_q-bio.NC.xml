      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning Identifies Latent Ultradian States in Multi-Modal Wearable Sensor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable sensors such as smartwatches have become ubiquitous in recent years, allowing the easy and continual measurement of physiological parameters such as heart rate, physical activity, body temperature, and blood glucose in an every-day setting. This multi-modal data offers the potential to identify latent states occurring across physiological measures, which may represent important bio-behavioural states that could not be observed in any single measure. Here we present an approach, utilising a hidden semi-Markov model, to identify such states in data collected using a smartwatch, electrocardiogram, and blood glucose monitor, over two weeks from a sample of 9 participants. We found 26 latent ultradian states across the sample, with many occurring at particular times of day. Here we describe some of these, as well as their association with subjective mood and time use diaries. These methods provide a novel avenue for developing insights into the physiology of everyday life.</description>

      <title>Neurocomputational Phenotypes in Female and Male Autistic Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by an altered phenotype in social interaction and communication. Additionally, autism typically manifests differently in females as opposed to males: a phenomenon that has likely led to long-term problems in diagnostics of autism in females. These sex-based differences in communicative behavior may originate from differences in neurocomputational properties of brain organization. The present study looked to examine the relationship between one neurocomputational measure of brain organization, the local power-law exponent, in autistic vs. neurotypical, as well as male vs. female participants. To investigate the autistic phenotype in neural organization based on biological sex, we collected continuous resting-state EEG data for 19 autistic young adults (10 F), and 23 controls (14 F), using a 64-channel Net Station EEG acquisition system. The data was analyzed to quantify the 1/f power spectrum. Correlations between power-law exponent and behavioral measures were calculated in a between-group (female vs. male; autistic vs. neurotypical) design. On average, the power-law exponent was significantly greater in the male ASD group than in the female ASD group in fronto-central regions. The differences were more pronounced over the left hemisphere, suggesting neural organization differences in regions responsible for language complexity. These differences provide a potential explanation for behavioral variances in female vs. male autistic young adults.</description>

      <title>Cooling down and waking up: feedback cooling switches an unconsciousness neural computer into a conscious quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02708v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of how feedback cooling in the brain reduces thermal noise to the point where macroscale quantum phenomena - crucially Bose-Einstein condensation - can operate at body temperature. It takes the core idea from Stapp that mind and brain interact via some sort of oscillator and identifies a likely candidate, neuronal arrays identified by Stapp as cortical minicolumns. Feedback cooling allows amplifiers to act like refrigerators, and when applied to minicolumns it is suggested they perform as quantum accelerators, solid-state devices able to supercharge standard computers. When the accelerator is idle, as in sleep, we have a neural computer operating unconsciously, but feedback cooling produces a Bose-Einstein condensate, quantum computation, and consciousness. The model explains how macroscale quantum phenomena can operate in a warm and noisy brain, how and why consciousness evolved, and gives insight into unconscious states like sleepwalking. The model is testable, predicting that cold states in the brain are detectable by magnetic resonance thermometry.</description>
