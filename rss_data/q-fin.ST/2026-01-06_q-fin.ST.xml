      <title>Can Large Language Models Improve Venture Capital Exit Timing After IPO?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exit timing after an IPO is one of the most consequential decisions for venture capital (VC) investors, yet existing research focuses mainly on describing when VCs exit rather than evaluating whether those choices are economically optimal. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in synthesizing complex financial data and textual information but have not been applied to post-IPO exit decisions. This study introduces a framework that uses LLMs to estimate the optimal time for VC exit by analyzing monthly post IPO information financial performance, filings, news, and market signals and recommending whether to sell or continue holding. We compare these LLM generated recommendations with the actual exit dates observed for VCs and compute the return differences between the two strategies. By quantifying gains or losses associated with following the LLM, this study provides evidence on whether AI-driven guidance can improve exit timing and complements traditional hazard and real-options models in venture capital research.</description>

      <title>Order-Constrained Spectral Causality in Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an operator-theoretic framework for causal analysis in multivariate time series based on order-constrained spectral non-invariance. Directional influence is defined as sensitivity of second-order dependence operators to admissible, order-preserving temporal deformations of a designated source component, yielding an intrinsically multivariate causal notion summarized through orthogonally invariant spectral functionals. Under linear Gaussian assumptions, the criterion coincides with linear Granger causality, while beyond this regime it captures collective and nonlinear directional dependence not reflected in pairwise predictability. We establish existence, uniform consistency, and valid inference for the resulting non-smooth supremum--infimum statistics using shift-based randomization that exploits order-induced group invariance, yielding finite-sample exactness under exact invariance and asymptotic validity under weak dependence without parametric assumptions. Simulations demonstrate correct size and strong power against distributed and bulk-dominated alternatives, including nonlinear dependence missed by linear Granger tests with appropriate feature embeddings. An empirical application to a high-dimensional panel of daily financial return series spanning major asset classes illustrates system-level causal monitoring in practice. Directional organization is episodic and stress-dependent, causal propagation strengthens while remaining multi-channel, dominant causal hubs reallocate rapidly, and statistically robust transmission channels are sparse and horizon-heterogeneous even when aggregate lead--lag asymmetry is weak. The framework provides a scalable and interpretable complement to correlation-, factor-, and pairwise Granger-style analyses for complex systems.</description>

      <title>On lead-lag estimation of non-synchronously observed point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new theoretical framework for analyzing lead-lag relationships between point processes, with a special focus on applications to high-frequency financial data. In particular, we are interested in lead-lag relationships between two sequences of order arrival timestamps. The seminal work of Dobrev and Schaumburg proposed model-free measures of cross-market trading activity based on cross-counts of timestamps. While their method is known to yield reliable results, it faces limitations because its original formulation inherently relies on discrete-time observations, an issue we address in this study. Specifically, we formulate the problem of estimating lead-lag relationships in two point processes as that of estimating the shape of the cross-pair correlation function (CPCF) of a bivariate stationary point process, a quantity well-studied in the neuroscience and spatial statistics literature. Within this framework, the prevailing lead-lag time is defined as the location of the CPCF's sharpest peak. Under this interpretation, the peak location in Dobrev and Schaumburg's cross-market activity measure can be viewed as an estimator of the lead-lag time in the aforementioned sense. We further propose an alternative lead-lag time estimator based on kernel density estimation and show that it possesses desirable theoretical properties and delivers superior numerical performance. Empirical evidence from high-frequency financial data demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Monetary Policy Under Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Analyzing Tabular and Function Approximation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how a central bank should dynamically set short-term nominal interest rates to stabilize inflation and unemployment when macroeconomic relationships are uncertain and time-varying. We model monetary policy as a sequential decision-making problem where the central bank observes macroeconomic conditions quarterly and chooses interest rate adjustments. Using publicly accessible historical Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), we construct a linear-Gaussian transition model and implement a discrete-action Markov Decision Process with a quadratic loss reward function. We chose to compare nine different reinforcement learning style approaches against Taylor Rule and naive baselines, including tabular Q-learning variants, SARSA, Actor-Critic, Deep Q-Networks, Bayesian Q-learning with uncertainty quantification, and POMDP formulations with partial observability. Notably, despite its simplicity, standard tabular Q-learning achieved the best performance (-615.13 +- 309.58 mean return), outperforming both enhanced RL methods and traditional policy rules. Our results suggest that while sophisticated RL techniques show promise for monetary policy applications, simpler approaches may be more robust in this domain, highlighting important challenges in applying modern RL to macroeconomic policy.</description>
