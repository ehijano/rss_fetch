      <description>arXiv:2504.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3rd AI Olympics with RealAIGym competition poses the challenge of developing a global policy that can swing up and stabilize an underactuated 2-link system Acrobot and/or Pendubot from any configuration in the state space. This paper presents an optimal control-based approach using a real-time Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). The results show that the controller achieves good performance and robustness and can reliably handle disturbances.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Modularized Neural Network for Advanced Building Control by Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) provides a promising solution for building energy modeling and can serve as a virtual environment to enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interact and learn. However, challenges remain in efficiently integrating physics priors, evaluating the effectiveness of physics constraints, balancing model accuracy and physics consistency, and enabling real-world implementation. To address these gaps, this study introduces a Physics-Informed Modularized Neural Network (PI-ModNN), which incorporates physics priors through a physics-informed model structure, loss functions, and hard constraints. A new evaluation metric called "temperature response violation" is developed to quantify the physical consistency of data-driven building dynamic models under varying control inputs and training data sizes. Additionally, a physics prior evaluation framework based on rule importance is proposed to assess the contribution of each individual physics prior, offering guidance on selecting appropriate PIML techniques. Results indicate that incorporating physical priors does not always improve model performance; inappropriate priors may decrease model accuracy and consistency. However, hard constraints are effective in enforcing model consistency. Furthermore, we present a general workflow for developing control-oriented PIML models and integrating them with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Following this framework, a case study implementing DRL in an office space over three months demonstrates potential energy savings of 31.4%. Finally, we provide a general guideline for integrating data-driven models with advanced building control through a four-step evaluation framework, paving the way for reliable and scalable deployment of advanced building controls.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Continuous-time Nonlinear Autoregressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to identify a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems defined by an ordinary differential equation affine in the unknown parameter. We define a notion of asymptotic consistency as $(n, h) \to (\infty, 0)$, and we achieve it using a family of direct methods where the first step is differentiating a noisy time series and the second step is a plug-in linear estimator. The first step, differentiation, is a signal processing adaptation of the nonparametric statistical technique of local polynomial regression. The second step, generalized linear regression, can be consistent using a least squares estimator, but we demonstrate two novel bias corrections that improve the accuracy for finite $h$. These methods significantly broaden the class of continuous-time systems that can be consistently estimated by direct methods.</description>

      <title>Extended Sensitivity-Aware Reactive Power Dispatch Algorithm for Smart Inverters with Multiple Control Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in distribution networks presents new challenges for voltage regulation and reactive power support. This paper extends a sensitivity-aware reactive power dispatch algorithm tailored to manage smart inverters operating under different control modes, including PQ, PV, and Volt-Var (VV). The proposed approach dynamically optimizes reactive power dispatch and voltage setpoints, enabling effective coordination among distribution systems as a virtual power plant (VPP) to support the transmission network. The algorithm is applied to the IEEE 13-bus and IEEE-123 bus test systems, and its performance is validated by comparing results with OpenDSS simulations across various operating scenarios. Results show that the maximum error in the voltages is less than 0.015 pu.</description>

      <title>Novel Data-Driven Indices for Early Detection and Quantification of Short-Term Voltage Instability from Voltage Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Short-Term Voltage Stability Index (STVSI), which leverages Lyapunov Exponent-based detection to assess and quantify short-term stability triggered by Over Excitation Limiters (OELs) or undamped oscillations in voltage. The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Entropy-Based Metric for Characterization of Delayed Voltage Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring accurate violation detection in power systems is paramount for operational reliability. This paper introduces an enhanced voltage recovery violation index (EVRVI), a comprehensive index designed to quantify fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR). EVRVI enhances traditional entropy-based methods by leveraging Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to extract key features from the voltage signal, which are then used to quantify over-voltage (OV) and under-voltage (UV) events. Our simulations on the Nordic system, involving over 245k scenarios, demonstrate EVRVI's superior ability to identify and categorize voltage recovery issues compared to the traditional entropy-based measure. EVRVI not only significantly reduces false negatives in violation detection but also provides a reliable framework for over-voltage detection, making it an invaluable tool for modern power system studies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control of Dual-Rotor Rotational System with Unknown Geometry and Unknown Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an input-output feedback linearization-based adaptive controller to stabilize and regulate a dual-rotor rotational system (DRRS), whose inertial properties as well as the geometric configuration of rotors are unknown. First, the equations of motion governing the dynamics of DRRS are derived using the Newton-Euler approach. Next, an input-output feedback linearization technique is used to linearize the dynamics from the rotor speeds to the angular position of the system. A finite-time convergent estimator, based on the portion of the DRRS dynamics, is used to update the required parameters in the controller. Finally, the proposed controller is validated in both step and harmonic command-following problems, and the robustness of the controller to the system's parameters is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Impact Assessment of Cyberattacks in Inverter-Based Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the evolution of modern power grids has been driven by the growing integration of remotely controlled grid assets. Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. The remote accessibility of such critical grid components creates entry points for attacks that adversaries could exploit, posing threats to the stability of the system. To evaluate the resilience of energy systems under such threats, this study employs real-time simulation and a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus system that incorporates a Microgrid (MG) with solar-based IBR. The study assesses the impact of remote attacks impacting the MG stability under different levels of IBR penetrations through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. Namely, we analyze voltage, current, and frequency profiles before, during, and after cyberattack-induced disruptions. The results demonstrate that real-time HIL testing is a practical approach to uncover potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies for resilient MG operations.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Intersection-based Distributed Kalman Filtering: Stability Problems Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the stability of covariance-intersection (CI)-based distributed Kalman filtering in time-varying systems. For the general time-varying case, a relationship between the error covariance and the observability Gramian is established. Utilizing this relationship, we demonstrate an intuition that the stability of a node is only related to the observability of those nodes that can reach it uniformly. For the periodic time-varying case, it is proved by a monotonicity analysis method that CI-based distributed Kalman filtering converges periodically for any initial condition. The convergent point is shown to be the unique positive definite solution to a Riccati-like equation. Additionally, by constructing an intermediate difference equation, the closed-loop transition matrix of the estimation error system is proved to be Schur stable. Notably, all theoretical results are obtained without requiring network connectivity assumptions. Finally, simulations verify the effectiveness of the stability results.</description>

      <title>A Douglas-Rachford Splitting Method for Solving Monotone Variational Inequalities in Linear-quadratic Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers constrained linear dynamic games with quadratic objective functions, which can be cast as affine variational inequalities. By leveraging the problem structure, we apply the Douglas-Rachford splitting, which generates a solution algorithm with linear convergence rate. The fast convergence of the method enables receding-horizon control architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the associated VI admits a closed-form solution within a neighborhood of the attractor, thus allowing for a further reduction in computation time. Finally, we benchmark the proposed method via numerical experiments in an automated driving application.</description>

      <title>A Control-Oriented Simplified Single Particle Model with Grouped Parameter and Sensitivity Analysis for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05924v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in transportation, energy storage, and consumer electronics, driving the need for reliable battery management systems (BMS) for state estimation and control. The Single Particle Model (SPM) balances computational efficiency and accuracy but faces challenges in parameter estimation due to numerous parameters. Current SPM models using parabolic approximation introduce intermediate variables and hard to do parameter grouping. This study presents a control-oriented SPM reformulation that employs parameter grouping and parabolic approximation to simplify model parameters while using average and surface lithium-ion concentrations as model output. By parameter grouping, the original 17 parameters were reduced to 9 grouped parameters. The reformulated model achieves a reduced-order ordinary differential equation form while maintaining mathematical accuracy equivalent to the pre-grouped discretized SPM. Through Sobol sensitivity analysis under various current profiles, the grouped parameters were reduced from 9 to 6 highly sensitive parameters. Results demonstrate that estimating these 6 parameters achieves comparable practical accuracy to estimating all 9 parameters, with faster convergence. This control-oriented SPM enhances BMS applications by facilitating state estimation and control while reducing parameter estimation requirements.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Extended Kalman Filtering for Battery State of Charge Estimation on STM32</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and computationally light algorithms for estimating the State of Charge (SoC) of a battery's cells are crucial for effective battery management on embedded systems. In this letter, we propose an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) for SoC estimation using a covariance adaptation technique based on maximum likelihood estimation - a novelty in this domain. Furthermore, we tune a key design parameter - the window size - to obtain an optimal memory-performance trade-off, and experimentally demonstrate our solution achieves superior estimation accuracy with respect to existing alternative methods. Finally, we present a fully custom implementation of the AEKF for a general-purpose low-cost STM32 microcontroller, showing it can be deployed with minimal computational requirements adequate for real-world usage.</description>

      <title>InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control~(MPC) is a powerful control strategy widely utilized in domains like energy management, building control, and autonomous systems. However, its effectiveness in real-world settings is challenged by the need to incorporate context-specific predictions and expert instructions, which traditional MPC often neglects. We propose \IMPC, a novel framework that addresses this gap by integrating real-time human instructions through a Large Language Model~(LLM) to produce context-aware predictions for MPC. Our method employs a Language-to-Distribution~(L2D) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and language-based MPC models, \IMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and fine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance guarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization~(DPO) using a tailored loss function.</description>

      <title>Control-Oriented Modelling and Adaptive Parameter Estimation for Hybrid Wind-Wave Energy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid wind-wave energy system, integrating floating offshore wind turbine and wave energy converters, has received much attention in recent years due to its potential benefit in increasing the power harvest density and reducing the levelized cost of electricity. Apart from the design complexities of the hybrid wind-wave energy systems, their energy conversion efficiency, power output smoothness and their safe operations introduce new challenges for their control system designs. Recent studies show that advanced model-based control strategies have the great potential to significantly improve their overall control performance. However the performance of these advanced control strategies rely on the computationally efficient control-oriented models with sufficient fidelity, which are normally difficult to derive due to the complexity of the hydro-, aero-dynamic effects and the couplings.In most available results, the hybrid wind-wave energy system models are established by using the Boundary Element Method, devoting to understanding the hydrodynamic responses and performance analysis. However, such models are complex and involved relatively heavy computational burden, which cannot be directly used for the advanced model-based control methods that are essential for improving power capture efficiency from implementing in practice. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a control-oriented model of the hybrid windwave energy system with six degrees of freedom. First, ...</description>

      <title>Hybrid Control as a Proxy for Detection and Mitigation of Sensor Attacks in Cooperative Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the robustness of cooperative driving against cyberattacks, we propose a hybrid controller scheme to detect and mitigate False-Data Injection (FDI) attacks in real-time. The core of our method builds on a given Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithm and exploits sensor redundancy to construct equivalent controllers, each driven by a distinct, non-overlapping subset of sensors (equivalent controller realizations). By construction, these controller realizations generate the same control input in the absence of an attack, allowing us to devise an algorithm that compares control signals and measurements to pinpoint anomalous behavior via a majority vote. This allows us to: 1) decide in real-time which subset of sensors is compromised; and 2) switch to a healthy subset, mitigating thus sensor FDI attacks. We model the latter logic as a hybrid dynamic controller that decides in real-time what realization to use, builds on attack-dependent flow and jump sets, and employs controller resets (to return the state of previously compromised controller realizations to a correct value after the attack stops). We demonstrate the performance of our scheme through simulation experiments.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic engineering is an emerging research domain that aims to realize important implementation advantages that brain-inspired technologies can offer over classical digital technologies, including energy efficiency, adaptability, and robustness. For the field of systems and control, neuromorphic controllers could potentially bring many benefits, but their advancement is hampered by lack of systematic analysis and design tools. In this paper, the objective is to show that hybrid systems methods can aid in filling this gap. We do this by formally analyzing rhythmic neuromorphic control of a pendulum system, which was recently proposed as a prototypical setup. The neuromorphic controller generates spikes, which we model as a Dirac delta pulse, whenever the pendulum angular position crosses its resting position, with the goal of inducing a stable limit cycle. This leads to modeling the closed-loop system as a hybrid dynamical system, which in between spikes evolves in open loop and where the jumps correspond to the spiking control actions. Exploiting the hybrid system model, we formally prove the existence, uniqueness, and a stability property of the hybrid limit cycle for the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations illustrate our approach. We finally elaborate on a possible spiking adaptation mechanism on the pulse amplitude to generate a hybrid limit cycle of a desired maximal angular amplitude.</description>

      <title>Linear Regulator-Based Synchronization of Positive Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the positive synchronization of interconnected systems on undirected graphs. For homogeneous positive systems, a static feedback protocol design is proposed, based on the Linear Regulator problem. The solution to the algebraic equation associated to the stabilizing policy can be found using a linear program. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the positivity of each agent's trajectory for all nonnegative initial conditions are also provided. Simulations on large regular graphs with different nodal degree illustrate the proposed results.</description>

      <title>Plug and Play Distributed Control of Clustered Energy Hub Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to renewable energy is driving the rise of distributed multi-energy systems, in which individual energy hubs and prosumers (e.g., homes, industrial campuses) generate, store, and trade energy. Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes are widely used to optimize operation of energy hubs by efficiently dispatching resources and minimizing costs while ensuring operational constraints are met. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among hubs enhances network efficiency and reduces costs but also increases computational and privacy challenges, especially as the network scales. Additionally, current distributed control techniques require global recomputation whenever the network topology changes, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a clustering-based P2P trading framework that enables plug-and-play operation, allowing energy hubs to seamlessly join or leave without requiring network-wide controller updates. The impact is restricted to the hubs within the affected cluster. The energy trading problem is formulated as a bi-level bargaining game, where inter-cluster trading commitments are determined at the cluster level, while energy dispatch and cost-sharing among hubs within a cluster are refined at the hub level. Both levels are solved in a distributed manner using ADMM, ensuring computational feasibility and privacy preservation. Moreover, we develop plug-and-play procedures to handle dynamic topology changes at both the hub and cluster levels, minimizing disruptions across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bi-level framework reduces operational costs, and enables scalable energy management under plug-and-play operation.</description>

      <title>Addressing Relative Degree Issues in Control Barrier Function Synthesis with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robotics, control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filters are commonly used to enforce state constraints. A critical challenge arises when the relative degree of the CBF varies across the state space. This variability can create regions within the safe set where the control input becomes unconstrained. When implemented as a safety filter, this may result in chattering near the safety boundary and ultimately compromise system safety. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach for CBF synthesis by formulating it as solving a set of boundary value problems. The solutions to the boundary value problems are determined using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our approach ensures that the synthesized CBFs maintain a constant relative degree across the set of admissible states, thereby preventing unconstrained control scenarios. We illustrate the approach in simulation and further verify it through real-world quadrotor experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving desired system safety properties.</description>

      <title>Towards Zero Trust Security in Connected Vehicles: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero Trust is the new cybersecurity model that challenges the traditional one by promoting continuous verification of users, devices, and applications, whatever their position or origin. This model is critical for reducing the attack surface and preventing lateral movement without relying on implicit trust. Adopting the zero trust principle in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially in the context of connected vehicles (CVs), presents an adequate solution in the face of increasing cyber threats, thereby strengthening the ITS environment. This paper offers an understanding of Zero Trust security through a comprehensive review of existing literature, principles, and challenges. It specifically examines its applications in emerging technologies, particularly within connected vehicles, addressing potential issues and cyber threats faced by CVs. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the systematic literature review were planned alongside a bibliometric analysis. Moreover, keyword co-occurrence analysis was done, which indicates trends and general themes for the Zero Trust model, Zero Trust implementation, and Zero Trust application. Furthermore, the paper explores various ZT models proposed in the literature for connected vehicles, shedding light on the challenges associated with their integration into CV systems. Future directions of this research will focus on incorporating Zero Trust principles within Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication paradigms. This initiative intends to enhance the security posture and safety protocols within interconnected vehicular networks. The proposed research seeks to address the unique cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in the highly dynamic nature of vehicular communication systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bayesian Affine Estimator and Active Learning for the Wiener Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian estimation framework for Wiener models, focusing on learning nonlinear output functions under known linear state dynamics. We derive a closed-form optimal affine estimator for the unknown parameters, characterized by the so-called "dynamic basis statistics (DBS)." Several features of the proposed estimator are studied, including Bayesian unbiasedness, closed-form posterior statistics, error monotonicity in trajectory length, and consistency condition (also known as persistent excitation). In the special case of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate that the closed-form description is computationally available, as the Fourier DBS enjoys explicit expression. Furthermore, we identify an inherent inconsistency in single-trajectory measurements, regardless of input excitation. Leveraging the closed-form estimation error, we develop an active learning algorithm synthesizing input signals to minimize estimation error. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, showing significant improvements over traditional regularized least-squares methods.</description>

      <title>Neural network-enhanced integrators for simulating ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous applications necessitate the computation of numerical solutions to differential equations across a wide range of initial conditions and system parameters, which feeds the demand for efficient yet accurate numerical integration methods.This study proposes a neural network (NN) enhancement of classical numerical integrators. NNs are trained to learn integration errors, which are then used as additive correction terms in numerical schemes. The performance of these enhanced integrators is compared with well-established methods through numerical studies, with a particular emphasis on computational efficiency. Analytical properties are examined in terms of local errors and backward error analysis. Embedded Runge-Kutta schemes are then employed to develop enhanced integrators that mitigate generalization risk, ensuring that the neural network's evaluation in previously unseen regions of the state space does not destabilize the integrator. It is guaranteed that the enhanced integrators perform at least as well as the desired classical Runge-Kutta schemes. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies using a realistic model of a wind turbine, with parameters derived from the established simulation framework OpenFast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dual quaternion-based control strategy for formation flying of small UAV groups is proposed. Through the definition of a virtual structure, the coordinated control of formation's position, orientation, and shape parameters is enabled. This abstraction simplifies formation management, allowing a low-level controller to compute commands for individual UAVs. The controller is divided into a pose control module and a geometry-based adaptive strategy, providing efficient and precise task execution. Simulation and experimental results validate the approach.</description>

      <title>Robust and Efficient Average Consensus with Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (OTA) computation has garnered increasing attention for its advantages in facilitating information aggregation among distributed agents in resource-constrained networks without requiring precise channel estimation. A promising application scenario of this method is distributed average consensus in wireless multi-agent systems. However, in such scenario, non-coherent interference from concurrent OTA transmissions can introduce bias in the consensus value. To address this issue, we develop a robust distributed average consensus algorithm by formulating the consensus problem as a distributed optimization problem. Using decentralized projected gradient descent (D-PGD), our proposed algorithm can achieve unbiased mean square average consensus even in the presence of non-coherent interference and noise. Additionally, we implement transmit power control and receive scaling mechanisms to further accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the convergence speed of the D-PGD algorithm for OTA average consensus without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity AoI-Optimal Status Update Control with Partial Battery State Information in Energy Harvesting IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a two-hop IoT system consisting of multiple energy harvesting sensors, a cache-enabled edge node, and multiple monitors, the status update control at the edge node, which has partial battery state information (pBSI) of the sensors, is formulated as a pBSI problem. The concept of inferred pBSI is introduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov decision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy to be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the expected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established for the general single-sensor status update problem. For the single-sensor pBSI problem, a semi-closed-form policy called the current-next (CN) policy is proposed, along with an efficient post-update value iteration algorithm with a per-iteration time complexity proportional to the square of the battery capacity. A weighted-update-gain-competition (WUGC) approach is further leveraged to extend the CN policy to the multi-sensor case. Numerical results in the single-sensor case demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the CN policy across various energy arrival processes. Simulations for an IoT system with $100$ sensors reveal that the WUGC-CN policy outperforms the maximum-age-first policy and the random-scheduling-based CN policy under Bernoulli energy arrival processes.</description>

      <title>Jointly-optimized Trajectory Generation and Camera Control for 3D Coverage Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a jointly optimized trajectory generation and camera control approach, enabling an autonomous agent, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operating in 3D environments, to plan and execute coverage trajectories that maximally cover the surface area of a 3D object of interest. Specifically, the UAV's kinematic and camera control inputs are jointly optimized over a rolling planning horizon to achieve complete 3D coverage of the object. The proposed controller incorporates ray-tracing into the planning process to simulate the propagation of light rays, thereby determining the visible parts of the object through the UAV's camera. This integration enables the generation of precise look-ahead coverage trajectories. The coverage planning problem is formulated as a rolling finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using mixed-integer programming techniques. Extensive real-world and synthetic experiments validate the performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Collision-free landing of multiple UAVs on moving ground vehicles using time-varying control barrier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a centralized approach for the control of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for landing on moving unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) using control barrier functions (CBFs). The proposed control framework employs two kinds of CBFs to impose safety constraints on the UAVs' motion. The first class of CBFs (LCBF) is a three-dimensional exponentially decaying function centered above the landing platform, designed to safely and precisely land UAVs on the UGVs. The second set is a spherical CBF (SCBF), defined between every pair of UAVs, which avoids collisions between them. The LCBF is time-varying and adapts to the motions of the UGVs. In the proposed CBF approach, the control input from the UAV's nominal tracking controller designed to reach the landing platform is filtered to choose a minimally-deviating control input that ensures safety (as defined by the CBFs). As the control inputs of every UAV are shared in establishing multiple CBF constraints, we prove that the control inputs are shared without conflict in rendering the safe sets forward invariant. The performance of the control framework is validated through a simulated scenario involving three UAVs landing on three moving targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time linear time-invariant relay feedback systems. Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</description>

      <title>A Corrector-aided Look-ahead Distance-based Guidance for Reference Path Following with an Efficient Midcourse Guidance Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient path-following is crucial in most of the applications of autonomous vehicles (UxV). Among various guidance strategies presented in literature, look-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based guidance method has received significant attention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low cross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generate bounded lateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes problematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produce higher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high variation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of look-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance strategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized $L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV toward the reference path in order to maintain minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the vehicle reaches a close vicinity of the reference path, a novel notion of corrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to generate the lateral acceleration command that effectively reduces the root mean square of the cross-track error thereafter. Simulation results demonstrate that this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance strategy along with the developed midcourse guidance scheme outperforms the conventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme both in terms of feasibility and measures of effectiveness like cross-track error and lateral acceleration requirements.</description>

      <title>Smart Exploration in Reinforcement Learning using Bounded Uncertainty Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for decision-making in uncertain environments, but it often requires large amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. We propose using prior model knowledge to guide the exploration process to speed up this learning process. This model knowledge comes in the form of a model set to which the true transition kernel and reward function belong. We optimize over this model set to obtain upper and lower bounds on the Q-function, which are then used to guide the exploration of the agent. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the Q-function to the optimal Q-function under the proposed class of exploring policies. Furthermore, we also introduce a data-driven regularized version of the model set optimization problem that ensures the convergence of the class of exploring policies to the optimal policy. Lastly, we show that when the model set has a specific structure, namely the bounded-parameter MDP (BMDP) framework, the regularized model set optimization problem becomes convex and simple to implement. In this setting, we also show that we obtain finite-time convergence to the optimal policy under additional assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed exploration strategy in a simulation study. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly speed up the learning process in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Linear time-and-space-invariant relaxation systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the physical property of relaxation from linear time-invariant (LTI) to linear time-and-space-invariant (LTSI) systems. It is shown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity, passivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the spatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and only if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone. This implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined uniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which the state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of fading memory functional.</description>

      <title>Robo-taxi Fleet Coordination at Scale via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06125v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fleets of robo-taxis offering on-demand transportation services, commonly known as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, hold significant promise for societal benefits, such as reducing pollution, energy consumption, and urban congestion. However, orchestrating these systems at scale remains a critical challenge, with existing coordination algorithms often failing to exploit the systems' full potential. This work introduces a novel decision-making framework that unites mathematical modeling with data-driven techniques. In particular, we present the AMoD coordination problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that exploits the main strengths of graph representation learning, reinforcement learning, and classical operations research tools. Extensive evaluations across diverse simulation fidelities and scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, achieving superior system performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability compared to prior methods. Finally, motivated by the need to democratize research efforts in this area, we release publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination alongside an open-source codebase designed to provide accessible simulation platforms and establish a standardized validation process for comparing methodologies.

      <title>Dictionary-free Koopman Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC) and Data-EnablEd Predictive Control (DeePC) use linear models to approximate nonlinear systems and integrate them with predictive control. Both approaches have recently demonstrated promising performance in controlling Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. However, selecting appropriate lifting functions for the Koopman operator in KMPC is challenging, while the data-driven representation from Willems' fundamental lemma in DeePC must be updated to approximate the local linearization when the equilibrium traffic state changes. In this paper, we propose a dictionary-free Koopman model predictive control (DF-KMPC) for CAV control. In particular, we first introduce a behavioral perspective to identify the optimal dictionary-free Koopman linear model. We then utilize an iterative algorithm to compute a data-driven approximation of the dictionary-free Koopman representation. Integrating this data-driven linear representation with predictive control leads to our DF-KMPC, which eliminates the need to select lifting functions and update the traffic equilibrium state. Nonlinear traffic simulations show that DF-KMPC effectively mitigates traffic waves and improves tracking performance.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Method for Contextual Stochastic Multi-armed Bandits with Rewards Generated by a Linear Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online decision-making can be formulated as the popular stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where a learner makes decisions (or takes actions) to maximize cumulative rewards collected from an unknown environment. This paper proposes to model a stochastic multi-armed bandit as an unknown linear Gaussian dynamical system, as many applications, such as bandits for dynamic pricing problems or hyperparameter selection for machine learning models, can benefit from this perspective. Following this approach, we can build a matrix representation of the system's steady-state Kalman filter that takes a set of previously collected observations from a time interval of length $s$ to predict the next reward that will be returned for each action. This paper proposes a solution in which the parameter $s$ is determined via an adaptive algorithm by analyzing the model uncertainty of the matrix representation. This algorithm helps the learner adaptively adjust its model size and its length of exploration based on the uncertainty of its environmental model. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies, revealing that the proposed scheme is capable of increasing the rate of collected cumulative rewards.</description>

      <title>Direct Adaptive Control of Grid-Connected Power Converters via Output-Feedback Data-Enabled Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power electronic converters are becoming the main components of modern power systems due to the increasing integration of renewable energy sources. However, power converters may become unstable when interacting with the complex and time-varying power grid. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data-driven control method to stabilize power converters by using only online input-output data. Our contributions are threefold. First, we reformulate the output-feedback control problem as a state-feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem with a controllable non-minimal state, which can be constructed from past input-output signals. Second, we propose a data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method for this non-minimal realization to achieve efficient output-feedback adaptive control. Third, we use high-fidelity simulations to verify that the output-feedback DeePO can effectively stabilize grid-connected power converters and quickly adapt to the changes in the power grid.</description>

      <title>Loop Shaping of Hybrid Motion Control with Contact Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard motion control with feedback of the output displacement cannot handle unforeseen contact with environment without penetrating into the soft, i.e. viscoelastic, materials or even damaging the fragile materials. Robotics and mechatronics with tactile and haptic capabilities, and in particular medical robotics for example, place special demands on the advanced motion control systems that should enable the safe and harmless contact transitions. This paper shows how the basic principles of loop shaping can be easily used to handle sufficiently stiff motion control in such a way that it is extended by sensor-free dynamic reconfiguration upon contact with the environment. A thereupon based hybrid control scheme is proposed. A remarkable feature of the developed approach is that no measurement of the contact force is required and the input signal and the measured output displacement are the only quantities used for design and operation. Experiments on 1-DOF actuator are shown, where the moving tool comes into contact with grapes that are soft and simultaneously penetrable.</description>

      <title>Impulsive Relative Motion Control with Continuous-Time Constraint Satisfaction for Cislunar Space Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent investments in cislunar applications open new frontiers for space missions within highly nonlinear dynamical regimes. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) to loiter around a given target with impulsive actuation while satisfying path constraints continuously over the finite time-horizon, i.e., independently of the number of nodes in which domain is discretized. Location, timing, magnitude, and direction of a fixed number of impulses are optimized in a model predictive framework, exploiting the exact nonlinear dynamics of non-stationary orbital regimes. The proposed approach is first validated on a relative orbiting problem with respect to a selenocentric near rectilinear halo orbit. The approach is then compared to a formulation with path constraints imposed only at nodes and with mesh refined to ensure complete satisfaction of path constraints over the continuous-time horizon. CPU time per iteration of 400 ms for the refined-mesh approach reduce to 5.5 ms for the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Deep Neural Network-based Frequency Predictor for Frequency-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir should be considered in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) to ensure frequency stability of the modern power systems. Since calculating the frequency response is complex, deep neural network (DNN) could be adopted to capture the nonlinearities and estimate those two metrics accurately. Therefore, in this paper, a DNN-based frequency predictor is developed with the training data obtained from time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC. Subsequently, it is reformulated using a set of mixed-integer linear programming formulations and then embedded into the FCOPF framework as constraints to ensure grid frequency stability, creating the proposed DNN-FCOPF model. Two benchmark models, a traditional OPF without any frequency constraints and a linear system-wide RoCoF-constrained FCOPF, are also implemented to gauge the proposed DNN-FCOPF. Finally, the solutions obtained with these three models are compared and evaluated with time-domain simulations using PSCAD under various load profiles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-FCOPF.</description>

      <title>Convergence Theory of Flexible ALADIN for Distributed Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method is a cutting-edge distributed optimization algorithm known for its superior numerical performance. It relies on each agent transmitting information to a central coordinator for data exchange. However, in practical network optimization and federated learning, unreliable information transmission often leads to packet loss, posing challenges for the convergence analysis of ALADIN. To address this issue, this paper proposes Flexible ALADIN, a random polling variant of ALADIN, and presents a rigorous convergence analysis, including global convergence for convex problems and local convergence for non-convex problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a pull-based real-time tracking system consisting of multiple partially coupled sources and a sink. The sink monitors the sources in real-time and can request one source for an update at each time instant. The sources send updates over an unreliable wireless channel. The sources are partially coupled, and updates about one source can provide partial knowledge about other sources. We study the problem of minimizing the sum of an average distortion function and a transmission cost. Since the controller is at the sink side, the controller (sink) has only partial knowledge about the source states, and thus, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and then cast it as a belief-MDP problem. Using the relative value iteration algorithm, we solve the problem and propose a control policy. Simulation results show the proposed policy's effectiveness and superiority compared to a baseline policy.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Boresight Control of Spacecraft Under Pointing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes an integrated boresight guidance and control (IBGC) scheme to address the boresight reorientation problem of spacecraft under temporal and pointing constraints. A $C^1$ continuous, saturated prescribed-time adjustment (PPTA) function is presented, along with the establishment of a practical prescribed-time stability theorem. Utilizing the time scale transformation technique and the PPTA function, we propose a prescribed-time guidance law that guides the boresight vector from almost any initial orientation in free space to a small neighborhood of the goal orientation within a preassigned time, while avoiding all forbidden zones augmented with safety margins. Subsequently, a prescribed-time disturbance observer (PTDO) is derived to reconstruct the external disturbances. By leveraging barrier and PPTA functions, a PTDO-based reduced-attitude tracking controller is developed, which ensures prescribed-time boresight tracking within a ``safe tube''. By judiciously setting the safety margins, settling times, and safe tube for the guidance and control laws, the proposed IBGC scheme achieves pointing-constrained boresight reorientation within a required task completion time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IBGC scheme.</description>

      <title>Faster Reinforcement Learning by Freezing Slow States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with "fast-slow" structure, where some state variables evolve rapidly ("fast states") while others change more gradually ("slow states"). Such structure is common in real-world problems where sequential decisions need to be made at high frequencies over long horizons, where slowly evolving information also influences optimal decisions. Examples include inventory control under slowly changing demand, or dynamic pricing with gradually shifting consumer behavior. Modeling the problem at the natural decision frequency leads to MDPs with discount factors close to one, making them computationally challenging. We propose a novel approximation strategy that "freezes" slow states during a phase of lower-level planning, solving finite-horizon MDPs conditioned on a fixed slow state, and then applying value iteration to an auxiliary upper-level MDP that evolves on a slower timescale. Freezing states for short periods of time leads to easier-to-solve lower-level problems, while a slower upper-level timescale allows for a more favorable discount factor. On the theoretical side, we analyze the regret incurred by our frozen-state approach, which leads to simple insights on how to trade off computational budget versus regret. Empirically, we demonstrate that frozen-state methods produce high-quality policies with significantly less computation, and we show that simply omitting slow states is often a poor heuristic.</description>

      <title>PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-based Decision-making for COLREGs and the Control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), devising decision-making and obstacle avoidance solutions that address maritime COLREGs (Collision Regulations), primarily defined for human operators, has long been a pressing challenge. Recent advancements in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have shown promise in enabling human-like decision-making. Notably, significant developments have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the decision-making of complex systems, such as self-driving cars. The textual and somewhat ambiguous nature of COLREGs (from an algorithmic perspective), however, poses challenges that align well with the capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that LLMs may become increasingly suitable for this application soon. This paper presents and demonstrates the first application of LLM-based decision-making and control for ASVs. The proposed method establishes a high-level decision-maker that uses online collision risk indices and key measurements to make decisions for safe manoeuvres. A tailored design and runtime structure is developed to support training and real-time action generation on a realistic ASV model. Local planning and control algorithms are integrated to execute the commands for waypoint following and collision avoidance at a lower level. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to apply explainable AI to the dynamic control problem of maritime systems recognising the COLREGs rules, opening new avenues for research in this challenging area. Results obtained across multiple test scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to maintain online COLREGs compliance, accurate waypoint tracking, and feasible control, while providing human-interpretable reasoning for each decision.</description>

Abstract: We develop compositional learning algorithms for coupled dynamical systems. While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parametrize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. The proposed compositional modeling framework and learning algorithms may be applied broadly to learn control-oriented models of dynamical systems in a variety of application areas, however, in this work, we focus on their application to the modeling of electrical networks. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated D.C. microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>

Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge to a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g. $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary conditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in the image and the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined that requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is shown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

      <title>A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.</description>

      <title>Improving Mixed-Criticality Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to scheduling mixed-criticality (MC) systems on processors with varying speeds. Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance.
  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.</description>
