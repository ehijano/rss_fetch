      <title>Cryptogenic stroke and migraine: using probabilistic independence and machine learning to uncover latent sources of disease from the electronic health record</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migraine is a common but complex neurological disorder that doubles the lifetime risk of cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, this relationship remains poorly characterized, and few clinical guidelines exist to reduce this associated risk. We therefore propose a data-driven approach to extract probabilistically-independent sources from electronic health record (EHR) data and create a 10-year risk-predictive model for CS in migraine patients. These sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Heritability of Longitudinal Rate-of-Change: Genetic Insights into PSA Velocity in Prostate Cancer-Free Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used for prostate cancer screening. While the genetics of PSA levels has been studied to enhance screening accuracy, the genetic basis of PSA velocity, the rate of PSA change over time, remains unclear. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, a large, randomized study with longitudinal PSA data (15,260 cancer-free males, averaging 5.34 samples per subject) and genome-wide genotype data, provides a unique opportunity to estimate PSA velocity heritability. We developed a mixed model to jointly estimate heritability of PSA levels at age 54 and PSA velocity. To accommodate the large dataset, we implemented two efficient computational approaches: a partitioning and meta-analysis strategy using average information restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML), and a fast restricted Haseman-Elston (REHE) regression method. Simulations showed that both methods yield unbiased estimates of both heritability metrics, with AI-REML providing smaller variability in the estimation of velocity heritability than REHE. Applying AI-REML to PLCO data, we estimated heritability at 0.32 (s.e. = 0.07) for baseline PSA and 0.45 (s.e. = 0.18) for PSA velocity. These findings reveal a substantial genetic contribution to PSA velocity, supporting future genome-wide studies to identify variants affecting PSA dynamics and improve PSA-based screening.</description>

      <title>Modeling electrical distribution networks with inhomogeneous Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider inhomogeneous Galton-Watson trees, and derive various moments for such processes: the number of vertices, the number of leaves, and the height of the tree. Also we make a simple condition of finiteness. We use these processes to model a data set consisting of electrical distribution networks, where we make a flexible framework for formulating models through the mean and variance of the offspring distributions. Furthermore, we introduce two mixture distributions as offspring distributions to reflect the particular form of the data. For estimation we use maximum likelihood estimation.</description>

      <title>Simulating MLB Seasons using Bayesian Inference and Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a dedicated follower of sports statistics and with the MLB season beginning in late March, I set out to predict how many wins each team would accumulate by the end of the 162 game season. The goal was to build a simulation framework capable of forecasting the remainder of the season, starting from a 20 game burn-in period to establish initial estimates of team strength. My approach used a Bayesian inference model incorporating team win percentage, batting average, and pitching ERA to construct a posterior distribution of win probability for each matchup. For each game, I sampled from the posterior and simulated the outcome using a Bernoulli trial. Because future matchup inputs were unobserved, I forecasted batting averages using random walks and modeled pitching ERA with Kalman filters. After simulating many seasons, the model produced a distribution of win totals for all 30 teams and can also be used to estimate each team's probability of making the postseason.</description>

      <title>Machine learning bridging battery field data and laboratory data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming at the dilemma that most laboratory data-driven diagnostic and prognostic methods cannot be applied to field batteries in passenger cars and energy storage systems, this paper proposes a method to bridge field data and laboratory data using machine learning. Only two field real impedances corresponding to a medium frequency and a high frequency are needed to predict laboratory real impedance curve, laboratory charge/discharge curve, and laboratory relaxation curve. Based on the predicted laboratory data, laboratory data-driven methods can be used for field battery diagnosis and prognosis. Compared with the field data-driven methods based on massive historical field data, the proposed method has the advantages of higher accuracy, lower cost, faster speed, readily available, and no use of private data. The proposed method is tested using two open-source datasets containing 249 NMC cells. For a test set containing 76 cells, the mean absolute percentage errors of laboratory real impedance curve, charge curve, and discharge curve prediction results are 0.85%, 4.72%, and 2.69%, respectively. This work fills the gap between laboratory data-driven diagnostic and prognostic methods and field battery applications, making all laboratory data-driven methods applicable to field battery diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, this work overturns the fixed path of developing field battery diagnostic and prognostic methods based on massive field historical data, opening up new research and breakthrough directions for field battery diagnosis and prognosis.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Logit Ordinal Regression with Proportional Odds under Nonignorable Missing Response -- Application to Phase III Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing data are inevitable in clinical trials, and trials that produce categorical ordinal responses are not exempted from this. Typically, missing values in the data occur due to different missing mechanisms, such as missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. Under a specific missing data regime, when the conditional distribution of the missing data is dependent on the ordinal response variable itself along with other predictor variables, then the missing data mechanism is called nonignorable. In this article we propose an expectation maximization based algorithm for fitting a proportional odds regression model when the missing responses are nonignorable. We report results from an extensive simulation study to illustrate the methodology and its finite sample properties. We also apply the proposed method to a recently completed Phase III psoriasis study using an investigational compound. The corresponding SAS program is provided.</description>

      <title>Assessing Risk Heterogeneity through Heavy-Tailed Frequency and Severity Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In operational risk management and actuarial finance, the analysis of risk often begins by dividing a random damage-generation process into its separate frequency and severity components. In the present article, we construct canonical families of mixture distributions for each of these components, based on a Negative Binomial kernel for frequency and a Gamma kernel for severity. The mixtures are employed to assess the heterogeneity of risk factors underlying an empirical distribution through the shape of the implied mixing distribution. From the duality of the Negative Binomial and Gamma distributions, we first derive necessary and sufficient conditions for heavy-tailed (i.e., inverse power-law) canonical mixtures. We then formulate flexible 4-parameter families of mixing distributions for Geometric and Exponential kernels to generate heavy-tailed 4-parameter mixture models, and extend these mixtures to arbitrary Negative Binomial and Gamma kernels, respectively, yielding 5-parameter mixtures for detecting and measuring risk heterogeneity. To check the robustness of such heterogeneity inferences, we show how a fitted 5-parameter model may be re-expressed in terms of alternative Negative Binomial or Gamma kernels whose associated mixing distributions form a "calibrated" family.</description>

      <title>Boosting Statistic Learning with Synthetic Data from Pretrained Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, raises a key question: how can synthetic data from these models enhance predictive modeling? While they can generate vast amounts of datasets, only a subset meaningfully improves performance. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that generates and systematically filters synthetic data through domain-specific statistical methods, selectively integrating high-quality samples for effective augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive performance across various settings, highlighting the potential of our framework while underscoring the inherent limitations of generative models for data augmentation. Despite the ability to produce large volumes of synthetic data, the proportion that effectively improves model performance is limited.</description>

      <title>Statistical Performance of Generalized Direction Detectors with Known Spatial Steering Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized direction detection (GDD) problem involves determining the presence of a signal of interest within matrix-valued data, where the row and column spaces of the signal (if present) are known, but the speciffc coordinates are unknown. Many detectors have been proposed for GDD, yet there is a lack of analytical results regarding their statistical detection performance. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two adaptive detectors for GDD in scenarios with known spatial steering vectors. Speciffcally, we establish their statistical distributions and develop closed-form expressions for both detection probability (PD) and false alarm probability (PFA). Simulation experiments are carried out to validate the theoretical results, demonstrating good agreement between theoretical and simulated results.</description>

      <title>Free Discontinuity Regression: With an Application to the Economic Effects of Internet Shutdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharp, multidimensional changepoints-abrupt shifts in a regression surface whose locations and magnitudes are unknown-arise in settings as varied as gene-expression profiling, financial covariance breaks, climate-regime detection, and urban socioeconomic mapping. Despite their prevalence, there are no current approaches that jointly estimate the location and size of the discontinuity set in a one-shot approach with statistical guarantees. We therefore introduce Free Discontinuity Regression (FDR), a fully nonparametric estimator that simultaneously (i) smooths a regression surface, (ii) segments it into contiguous regions, and (iii) provably recovers the precise locations and sizes of its jumps. By extending a convex relaxation of the Mumford-Shah functional to random spatial sampling and correlated noise, FDR overcomes the fixed-grid and i.i.d. noise assumptions of classical image-segmentation approaches, thus enabling its application to real-world data of any dimension. This yields the first identification and uniform consistency results for multivariate jump surfaces: under mild SBV regularity, the estimated function, its discontinuity set, and all jump sizes converge to their true population counterparts. Hyperparameters are selected automatically from the data using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate, and large-scale simulations up to three dimensions validate the theoretical results and demonstrate good finite-sample performance. Applying FDR to an internet shutdown in India reveals a 25-35% reduction in economic activity around the estimated shutdown boundaries-much larger than previous estimates. By unifying smoothing, segmentation, and effect-size recovery in a general statistical setting, FDR turns free-discontinuity ideas into a practical tool with formal guarantees for modern multivariate data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In team sports, traditional ranking statistics do not allow for the simultaneous evaluation of both individuals and combinations of players. Metrics for individual player rankings often fail to include the interaction effects between groups of players, while methods for assessing full lineups cannot be used to identify the value of lower-order combinations of players (pairs, trios, etc.). Given that player and lineup rankings are inherently dependent on each other, these limitations may affect the accuracy of performance evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel adjusted plus-minus (APM) approach that allows for the simultaneous ranking of individual players, lower-order combinations of players, and full lineups within a team. The method adjusts for the complete dependency structure and is motivated by the connection between APM and the hypergraph representation of a team. We discuss the similarities of our approach to other advanced metrics, demonstrate it using NBA data from 2012-2022, and suggest potential directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Extended-support beta regression for $[0, 1]$ responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the XBX regression model, a continuous mixture of extended-support beta regressions for modelling bounded responses with boundary observations. The core building block of XBX regression is the extended-support beta distribution, a censored version of a four-parameter beta distribution with the same exceedance on the left and right of $(0, 1)$. Hence, XBX regression is a direct extension of beta regression. We prove that beta regression and heteroscedastic normal regression with censoring at both $0$ and $1$ -- also known as the heteroscedastic two-limit tobit model in the econometrics literature -- are special cases of extended-support beta regression, depending on whether a single extra parameter is zero or infinity, respectively. To overcome identifiability issues due to the similarity of the beta and normal distributions for certain parameter values, we shrink towards beta regression by letting the extra parameter have an exponential distribution with unknown mean. A Gauss-Laguerre quadrature approximation results in efficient likelihood-based estimation and inference procedures, which the betareg R package implements since version 3.2.0. We use XBX regression to analyze investment decisions in a behavioural economics experiment about the occurrence and extent of loss aversion. In contrast to standard approaches, we capture both the probability of rational behaviour and the mean of loss aversion. Extensive comparisons with alternative approaches illustrate the effectiveness of the new model.</description>

      <title>Summarizing Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture Posterior -- Sliced Optimal Transport Metrics for Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14674v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methods to summarize posterior inference for mixture models focus on identifying a point estimate of the implied random partition for clustering, with density estimation as a secondary goal (Wade and Ghahramani, 2018; Dahl et al., 2022). We propose a novel approach for summarizing posterior inference in nonparametric Bayesian mixture models, prioritizing estimation of the mixing measure (or mixture) as an inference target. One of the key features is the model-agnostic nature of the approach, which remains valid under arbitrarily complex dependence structures in the underlying sampling model. Using a decision-theoretic framework, our method identifies a point estimate by minimizing posterior expected loss. A loss function is defined as a discrepancy between mixing measures. Estimating the mixing measure implies inference on the mixture density and the random partition. Exploiting the discrete nature of the mixing measure, we use a version of sliced Wasserstein distance. We introduce two specific variants for Gaussian mixtures. The first, mixed sliced Wasserstein, applies generalized geodesic projections on the product of the Euclidean space and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. The second, sliced mixture Wasserstein, leverages the linearity of Gaussian mixture measures for efficient projection</description>
