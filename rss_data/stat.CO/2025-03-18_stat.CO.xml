      <title>Fast Algorithm for Calculating Probability of Chess Winning Streaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the controversy in the chess community, where Hikaru Nakamura, a renowned grandmaster, has posted multiple impressive winning streaks over the years on the online platform chess.com, we derive the probabilities of various types of streaks in online chess and/or other sports. Specifically, given the winning/drawing/losing probabilities of individual games, we derive the probabilities of "pure" winning streaks, non-losing streaks, and "in-between" streaks involving at most one draw over the course of games played in a period. The performance of the developed algorithms is examined through numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Bayesian inference under model misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based Bayesian inference (SBI) methods are widely used for parameter estimation in complex models where evaluating the likelihood is challenging but generating simulations is relatively straightforward. However, these methods commonly assume that the simulation model accurately reflects the true data-generating process, an assumption that is frequently violated in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the challenges faced by SBI methods under model misspecification. We consolidate recent research aimed at mitigating the effects of misspecification, highlighting three key strategies: i) robust summary statistics, ii) generalised Bayesian inference, and iii) error modelling and adjustment parameters. To illustrate both the vulnerabilities of popular SBI methods and the effectiveness of misspecification-robust alternatives, we present empirical results on an illustrative example.</description>

      <title>Community Detection Analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial transcriptomics (ST) data produced by recent biotechnologies, such as CosMx and Xenium, contain huge amount of information about cancer tissue samples, which has great potential for cancer research via detection of community: a collection of cells with distinct cell-type composition and similar neighboring patterns. But existing clustering methods do not work well for community detection of CosMx ST data, and the commonly used kNN compositional data method shows lack of informative neighboring cell patterns for huge CosMx data. In this article, we propose a novel and more informative disk compositional data (DCD) method, which identifies neighboring patterns of each cell via taking into account of ST data features from recent new technologies. After initial processing ST data into DCD matrix, a new innovative and interpretable DCD-TMHC community detection method is proposed here. Extensive simulation studies and CosMx breast cancer data analysis clearly show that our proposed DCD-TMHC method is superior to other methods. Based on the communities detected by DCD-TMHC method for CosMx breast cancer data, the logistic regression analysis results demonstrate that DCD-TMHC method is clearly interpretable and superior, especially in terms of assessment for different stages of cancer. These suggest that our proposed novel, innovative, informative and interpretable DCD-TMHC method here will be helpful and have impact to future cancer research based on ST data, which can improve cancer diagnosis and monitor cancer treatment progress.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman-Bucy filtering for nonlinear model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal control for partially observed dynamical systems. Despite its prevalence in practical applications, there are still very few algorithms available, which take uncertainties in the current state estimates and future observations into account. In other words, most current approaches separate state estimation from the optimal control problem. In this paper, we extend the popular ensemble Kalman filter to receding horizon optimal control problems in the spirit of nonlinear model predictive control. We provide an interacting particle approximation to the forward-backward stochastic differential equations arising from Pontryagin's maximum principle with the forward stochastic differential equation provided by the time-continuous ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter equations. The receding horizon control laws are approximated as linear and are continuously updated as in nonlinear model predictive control. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology for an inverted pendulum example.</description>

      <title>H-AddiVortes: Heteroscedastic (Bayesian) Additive Voronoi Tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Heteroscedastic AddiVortes model, a Bayesian non-parametric regression framework that simultaneously models the conditional mean and variance of a response variable using adaptive Voronoi tessellations. By employing a sum-of-tessellations approach for the mean and a product-of-tessellations approach for the variance, the model provides a flexible and interpretable means to capture complex, predictor-dependent relationships and heteroscedastic patterns in data. This dual-layer representation enables precise inference, even in high-dimensional settings, while maintaining computational feasibility through efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and conjugate prior structures. We illustrate the model's capability through both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to capture nuanced variance structures, provide reliable predictive uncertainty quantification, and highlight key predictors influencing both the mean response and its variability. Empirical results show that the Heteroscedastic AddiVortes model offers a substantial improvement in capturing distributional properties compared to both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic alternatives, making it a robust tool for complex regression problems in various applied settings.</description>

      <title>fkbma: An R Package for Detecting Tailoring Variables with Free-Knot B-Splines and Bayesian Model Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision medicine aims to optimize treatment by identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit from specific interventions. To support this goal, we introduce fkbma, an R package that implements a Bayesian model averaging approach with free-knot B-splines for identifying tailoring variables. The package employs a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to flexibly model treatment effect heterogeneity while accounting for uncertainty in both variable selection and non-linear relationships. fkbma provides a comprehensive framework for detecting predictive biomarkers, integrating Bayesian adaptive enrichment strategies, and enabling robust subgroup identification in clinical trials and observational studies. This paper details the statistical methodology underlying fkbma, outlines its computational implementation, and demonstrates its application through simulations and real-world examples. The package's flexibility makes it a valuable tool for precision medicine research, offering a principled approach to treatment personalization.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Sparse Functional Linear Discriminant Analysis: An Application to Inflammatory Bowel Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), including Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), presents significant public health challenges due to its complex etiology. Motivated by the IBD study of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project, our objective is to identify microbial pathways that distinguish between CD, UC and non-IBD over time. Most current research relies on simplistic analyses that examine one variable or time point at a time, or address binary classification problems, limiting our understanding of the dynamic interactions within the microbiome over time. To address these limitations, we develop a novel functional data analysis approach for discriminant analysis of multivariate functional data that can effectively handle multiple high-dimensional predictors, sparse time points, and categorical outcomes. Our method seeks linear combinations of functions (i.e., discriminant functions) that maximize separation between two or more groups over time. We impose a sparsity-inducing penalty when estimating the discriminant functions, allowing us to identify relevant discriminating variables over time. Applications of our method to the motivating data identified microbial features related to mucin degradation, amino acid metabolism, and peptidoglycan recognition, which are implicated in the progression and development of IBD. Furthermore, our method highlighted the role of multiple vitamin B deficiencies in the context of IBD. By moving beyond traditional analytical frameworks, our innovative approach holds the potential for uncovering clinically meaningful discoveries in IBD research.</description>

      <title>Rejection Sampling with Vertical Weighted Strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of distributions that arise in statistical applications can be expressed in the form of a weighted density: the product of a base density and a nonnegative weight function. Generating variates from such a distribution may be nontrivial and can involve an intractable normalizing constant. Rejection sampling may be used to generate exact draws, but requires formulation of a suitable proposal distribution. To be practically useful, the proposal must both be convenient to sample from and not reject candidate draws too frequently. A well-known approach to design a proposal involves decomposing the target density into a finite mixture, whose components may correspond to a partition of the support. This work considers such a construction that focuses on majorization of the weight function. This approach may be applicable when assumptions for adaptive rejection sampling and related algorithms are not met. An upper bound for the rejection probability based on this construction can be expressed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposal before sampling. A method to partition the support is considered where regions are bifurcated based on their contribution to the bound. Several applications based on the von Mises Fisher distribution are presented to illustrate the framework.</description>
