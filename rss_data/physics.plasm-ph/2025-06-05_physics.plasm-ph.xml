      <title>Characterization of reduced-order turbulence models in the L-mode pedestal-forming region in JET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear instability characterization of seven JET discharges just prior to the L-H transition is performed at $\rho_{\text{tor}} \in [0.85,0.9,0.95]$ with the gyrokinetic GENE code. The discharges cover both the low- and high-density branches of the L-H transition at two different triangularities. Sensitivities to driving gradients, normalized electron collisonality $\nu_e^*$, hydrogen isotope mass, magnetic geometry and finite-$\beta$ effects are all characterized. At $\rho_{\text{tor}}=0.85$ and $0.9$, trapped-electron modes (TEMs) propagating in both the electron- or ion-drift direction are observed at the lowest densities. At higher density ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) modes are dominant, some of which exhibit trapped-ion drive and unconventional ballooning structures. At $\rho_{\text{tor}}=0.95$, the low-density cases are similar to inner radii, while at higher densities subdominant modes are destabilized by higher collisionalities. The electron collisonality $\nu_e^*$ is scanned around the experimental values at all three radii and for the seven discharges studied. The experimental collisionality range corresponds to a region of minimum linear drive between ITG-TEM mode branches at lower collisionalities and resistive mode branches at higher collisionalities. Moreover, the quasilinear particle flux is directed inward only in the collisionality domain where the linear drive is minimized at $\rho_{\text{tor}}=0.85$ for all densities and $0.9$ only for the highest densities. Model fidelity reduction is performed on the GENE simulations to evaluate the impact of various assumptions and simplifications made by the state-of-the-art quasilinear models QuaLiKiz and TGLF. QuaLiKiz is found to be inadequate beyond $\rho_{\text{tor}}=0.85$, while TGLF-SAT2 agrees well with linear spectra and the quasilinear heat fluxes from GENE up to and including $\rho_{\text{tor}}=0.9$.</description>

      <title>Tungsten erosion and scrape-off layer transport modelling in L-mode helium plasma discharges in ASDEX Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its unavoidable presence in thermonuclear DT plasmas and to its peculiar effects on materials, investigating the role of helium (He) in plasma-wall interaction (PWI) in current tokamaks is fundamental. In this work, PWI in L-mode He plasma discharges in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) is modelled by exploiting simplified analytical approaches and two state-of-the-art codes. SOLPS-ITER is employed both to provide a suitable background plasma for erosion simulations and to interpret diagnostics measurements in terms of He+/2+ fraction. In particular, a 50-50% concentration of the two He ions is found in the proximity of the strike-points, while He2+ represents the dominant population farther in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The role of He ion fraction on AUG tungsten divertor erosion is first estimated by means of a simple analytical model and, afterwards, by exploiting ERO2.0, showing the major impact of He2+ in common AUG plasma temperatures. ERO2.0 findings are also compared with experimental erosion data in the strike-point region, showing the possible impact of extrinsic impurities on divertor erosion. Finally, the multi-fluid and kinetic approaches employed in this work to simulate W erosion and migration are compared, including W also in SOLPS-ITER modelling. The impact of target boundary conditions on the W source in SOLPS-ITER is investigated, in order to find a good agreement with ERO2.0 estimation. Then, W migration in the two codes is compared, showing a stronger W transport towards the X-point in ERO2.0 compared to present SOLPS-ITER simulations with no drifts. Similar W influx in core could be achieved by reducing anomalous diffusivity in ERO2.0.</description>

      <title>Concentration profiles of OH and H$_2$O$_2$ in plasma-treated water: influence of power, gas mixture and treatment distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma liquid interactions are important for a range of applications. For these, H$_2$O$_2$ and OH represent two key reactive species, whose concentrations in liquids need to be controlled for effective application outcomes. Here, a combination of gas and liquid simulations is used to study the concentration profiles of H$_2$O$_2$ and OH in water treated by a radio-frequency-driven plasma jet, with a glass capillary between the electrodes, operated in He with admixtures of water vapour. Simulations are compared with measured H$_2$O$_2$ concentrations and found to be in good qualitative agreement as plasma power and water admixture are varied. Simulation results show that the concentration profiles of H$_2$O$_2$ in the liquid are mainly determined by transport, while those of OH are limited by reactions with H$_2$O$_2$, which consumes OH. For a given plasma operating condition, the concentration and penetration depth of H$_2$O$_2$ increase with plasma treatment time, while those of OH tend to decrease because of the increasing H$_2$O$_2$ concentration. Plasma power, water vapour admixture, and the distance between the jet and the liquid surface all allow for the concentrations of H$_2$O$_2$ and OH to be controlled. The OH delivered from the gas phase to the liquid, and its concentration within the liquid are strongly dependent on the reaction pathways occurring in the effluent region, such that the trends in OH density at the end of the plasma region differ from those in the liquid. While the concentration of OH in the liquid is always much lower than that of H$_2$O$_2$, the ratio of the two species can be controlled over orders of magnitude by varying water admixture and power. The highest selectivity to OH is at low water admixtures, low powers and short treatment times, while the highest selectivity to H$_2$O$_2$ is at high water admixtures, high powers and long treatment times.</description>

      <title>Plasma sheath physics: A circuital description, amelioration, and application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A synoptic review of the electrical circuital model-based analysis of laboratory plasma sheaths, alongside their stability features in a realistic broader horizon, is systematically presented herein. It explains the basic physics responsible for the inductive (L_sh), capacitive (C_sh), and resistive (R_sh) properties simultaneously, exhibited by plasma sheaths. The analyzed model sheath behaviors are judiciously described in the light of the state-of-the-art sheath scenarios, illustratively. The sheath-based circuital components are minutely contrasted with the traditionally available circuital counterparts. The applications of the novel circuital sheath model in widespread fields of research having both fundamental and applied importance are discussed. The main merits of modelling plasma sheaths through the circuital formalism over the existing non-circuital theoretical ones are briefly outlined, jointly with future applied scope.</description>

      <title>Impact of triangularity on edge transport and divertor detachment: a SOLPS-ITER study of TCV L-mode plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative triangularity (NT) magnetic configurations have recently gained attention as a promising route to achieve H-mode-like confinement without edge-localized modes (ELMs) and without a power threshold for access. While both core and edge confinement properties of NT have been extensively documented, consistently lower divertor target cooling and increased difficulty in achieving a detached regime have been observed. This work presents a comparative SOLPS-ITER modeling study of two Ohmic L-mode discharges in the TCV tokamak with identical divertor geometry and opposite upper triangularity. We investigate whether magnetic geometry alone can account for the experimentally observed differences in plasma detachment behavior. Simulations with identical transport coefficients reveal no significant differences between NT and positive triangularity (PT) cases, even when including drifts. A parametric scan of radial anomalous transport coefficients shows that reproducing the experimental profiles requires lower particle diffusivity in NT, consistent with reduced turbulent transport and previous findings. Furthermore, the evolution of simulated neutral pressures and recycling fluxes along a density scan reproduces experimental observations of larger neutral divertor pressure in PT, highlighting a distinct neutral dynamics in the two cases. These results support the interpretation that altered cross-field transport, rather than magnetic geometry alone, underlies the observed differences in divertor behavior between NT and PT scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sheath electron heating in surface wave discharges driven at microwave frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using fully electromagnetic particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo simulations, the electron heating due to interaction with a moving sheath is demonstrated to dominate in surface wave-driven discharges at microwave frequencies and relatively low pressures. Electrons impinging on the rapidly expanding sheath gain energy by repulsion from its strongly negative potential, similarly to the corresponding mechanism in capacitively coupled discharges driven at radio frequencies. This results in generation of energetic electron beams propagating towards the bulk plasma. In contrast to the expectations from previous theoretical studies, the electron heating due to plasma resonance is not observed.</description>

      <title>Experimental and simulative study on laser irradiation of 3D-printed micro-structures at intensities relevant for inertial confinement fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial confinement fusion requires a constant search for the most effective materials for improving the efficiency of the compression of the capsule and of the laser-to-target energy transfer. Foams could provide a solution to these problems, but they require further experimental and theoretical investigation. The new 3D-printing technologies, such as the two-photon polymerization, are opening a new era in the production of foams, allowing for the fine control of the material morphology. Detailed studies of their interaction with high-power lasers in regimes relevant for inertial confinement fusion are very few in the literature so far and more investigation is needed. In this work we present the results an experimental campaign performed at the ABC laser facility in ENEA Centro Ricerche Frascati where 3D-printed micro-structured materials were irradiated at high power. 3D simulations of the laser-target interaction performed with the FLASH code reveal a strong scattering when the center of the focal spot is on the through hole of the structure. The time required for the laser to completely ablate the structure obtained by the simulations is in good agreement with the experimental measurement. The measure of the reflected and transmitted laser light indicates that the scattering occurred during the irradiation, in accordance with the simulations. Two-plasmon decay has also been found to be active during irradiation.</description>

      <title>Laser-plasma acceleration in a conical plasma channel with longitudinally inhomogeneous plasma profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-plasma acceleration is considered as a modern method of accelerating bunches using a wakefield excited by a laser pulse. This paper demonstrates the use of a longitudinally inhomogeneous increasing plasma density gradient in a conical channel to increase of the energy of a self-injected bunch. Comparison of a conical channels with homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma and also conical and cylindrical homogeneous channels, shows a clear advantage of an inhomogeneous conical channel. The longitudinally inhomogeneous plasma helps to maintain the self-injected bunch in the wakefield acceleration phase and increases the accelerating gradient. The conical geometry prevents laser pulse expanding, and compress it. The combined effect was shown: the inhomogeneous plasma use, the effect of a conical geometry led to significant increasing the accelerating gradient and longitudinal momentum of the bunch.</description>

      <title>Studying mirror acceleration via kinetic simulations of relativistic plasma turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient turbulent acceleration of particles is indicated by recent astrophysical observations, but its mechanism is not well understood. Mirror acceleration has recently been proposed as an efficient mechanism for particle energization in turbulence-compressed magnetic fields. We employ a 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of pair plasma in magnetized and relativistic turbulence to study this new mechanism and its acceleration efficiency. By tracking individual particles, we see that reversal of a particle's moving direction and significant energy gain can happen during one mirror interaction and within one gyro-orbit. As expected for mirror acceleration, we statistically find that (1) energy gain is preferentially in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field and positively correlated with local magnetic field strengthening, and (2) the particle pitch angle distribution becomes increasingly anisotropic toward higher energies, with a concentration at large pitch angles. Our results demonstrate that the mirror acceleration causes a strong confinement of particles by stochastically increasing their pitch angles. This, in turn, facilitates repeated mirror acceleration with the mirroring condition well satisfied. We conclude that mirror acceleration is a promising mechanism accounting for efficient acceleration in magnetized and turbulent astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Investigating Turbulence Effects on Magnetic Reconnection Rates Through Three-Dimensional Resistive Magnetohydrodynamical Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of turbulence on magnetic reconnection through high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, spanning Lundquist numbers from $S=10^3$ to $10^6$. Building on Lazarian and Vishniac's (1999) theory, which asserts reconnection rate independence from Ohmic resistivity, we introduce small-scale perturbations until $t=0.1\, t_A$. Even after the perturbations cease, turbulence persists, resulting in sustained high reconnection rates of $V_\text{rec}/V_A \sim 0.03-0.08$. These rates exceed those generated by resistive tearing modes (plasmoid chain) in 2D and 3D MHD simulations by factors of 5 to 6. Our findings match observations in solar phenomena and previous 3D MHD global simulations of solar flares, accretion flows, and relativistic jets. The simulations show a steady-state fast reconnection rate compatible with the full development of turbulence in the system, demonstrating the robustness of the process in turbulent environments. We confirm reconnection rate independence from the Lundquist number, supporting Lazarian and Vishniac's theory of fast turbulent reconnection. Additionally, we find a mild dependence of $V_\text{rec}$ on the plasma-$\beta$ parameter, decreasing from 0.036 to 0.028 (in Alfv\'en units) as $\beta$ increases from 2.0 to 64.0 for simulations with a Lundquist number of $10^5$. Lastly, we explore the magnetic Prandtl number's ($\text{Pr}_m=\nu/\eta$) influence on the reconnection rate and find it negligible during the turbulent regime across the range tested, from $\text{Pr}_m=1$ to $60$.</description>

      <title>Enhancement to Fusion Reactivity in Sheared Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sheared flow increases the reactivity of fusion plasma. In unmagnetized plasma with flow gradients comparable to the mean free path of reacting ions, fusion reactivity can be more than doubled. The effect is of particular relevance to inertial confinement fusion (ICF), where it allows implosion kinetic energy to contribute to the fusion burn even before thermalizing. In fast ignition, this allows remarkable energy savings because colder fuel stops alpha particles more quickly, enabling ignition in a smaller hot spot.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>
