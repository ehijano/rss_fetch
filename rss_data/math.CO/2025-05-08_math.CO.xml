      <title>The Degree Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree polynomial of a multigraph $G$ is given by $\sum _{v \in V(G)} x^{\mbox{deg}(v)}$. We investigate here properties of the roots of such polynomials. In addition to examining the roots for some families of graphs with few and many degrees, we provide some bounds on the moduli of the roots. We also propose a region that contains all roots for multigraphs of order $n$.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism Theorems for Impartial Combinatorial Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the category of optiongraphs and option preserving maps as a model to study impartial combinatorial games. Outcomes, remoteness, and extended nim-values are preserved under option preserving maps. We show that the four isomorphism theorems from universal algebra are valid in this category. Quotient optiongraphs, including the minimum quotient, provide simplifications that can help in the analysis of games.</description>

      <title>The k-Sudoku Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph of order $n$ with chromatic number $\chi(G)$. Let $ k \geq \chi(G) $ and $S \subseteq V$. Let $ C_0 $ be a $k$-coloring of the induced subgraph $ G[S] $. The coloring $C_0$ is called an extendable coloring, if $C_0$ can be extended to a $k$-coloring of $G$ and it is a $k$- Sudoku coloring of $G$, if $C_0$ can be uniquely extended to a $k$-coloring of $G$. The smallest order of such an induced subgraph $G[S]$ of $G$ which admits a $k$- Sudoku coloring is called $k$- Sudoku number of $G$ and is denoted by $sn(G,k)$. When $k=\chi(G)$, we call $k$- Sudoku number of $G$ as Sudoku number of $G$ and is denoted by $sn(G)$. In this paper, we have obtained the $3$- Sudoku number of some bipartite graphs $P_n$, $C_{2n}$, $K_{m,n}$, $B_{m,n}$ and $G \circ lK_1$, where $G$ is a bipartite graph and $l\geq1$. Also, we have obtained the necessary and sufficient conditions for a bipartite graph $G$ to have $sn(G,3)$ equal to $n$, $n-1$ or $n-2$. Also, we study the relation between $k$- Sudoku number of a graph $G$ and the Sudoku number of a supergraph $H$ of $G$.</description>

      <title>Nordhaus-Gaddum-type theorems for maximum average degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-decomposition $(G_1,\dots,G_k)$ of a graph $G$ is a partition of its edge set into $k$ spanning subgraphs $G_1,\dots,G_k$. The classical theorem of Nordhaus and Gaddum bounds $\chi(G_1) + \chi(G_2)$ and $\chi(G_1) \chi(G_2)$ over all 2-decompositions of $K_n$.
  For a graph parameter $p$, let $p(k,G) = \max \{ \sum_{i=1}^k p(Gi) \}$, taken over all $k$-decompositions of graph $G$. In this paper we consider $M(k,K_n) = M(k,n) = \max \{ \sum_{i=1}^k \mathrm{Mad}(G_i) \}$, taken over all $k$-decompositions of the complete graph $K_n$, where $\mathrm{Mad}(G)$ denotes the maximum average degree of $G$, $\mathrm{Mad}(G) = \max \{ 2e(H)/|H| : H \subseteq G \} = \max \{d(H) : H \subseteq G \}$.
  Among the many results obtained in this paper we mention the following selected ones.
  (1) $M(k, n) &lt; \sqrt{k} n$, and $\lim_{k\to\infty} ( \liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{M(k,n)}{\sqrt{k}\,n} ) = 1$.
  (2) Exact determination of $M(2,n)$.
  (3) Exact determination of $M(k,n)$ when $k = \binom{n}{2} - t$, $0 \leq t\leq (n-1)^2/3$.
  Applications of these bounds to other parameters considered before in the literature are given.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proofs for partitions with repeated smallest part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Andrews and EI Bachraoui considered the number of integer partitions whose smallest part is repeated exactly $k$ times and the remaining parts are not repeated. They presented several interesting results and posed questions regarding combinatorial proofs for these identities. In this paper, we establish bijections to provide combinatorial proofs for these results.</description>

      <title>Pattern avoidance in revised ascent sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the definition of modified ascent sequences, we introduce a new class of integer sequences called revised ascent sequences. These sequences are defined as Cayley permutations where each entry is a leftmost occurrence if and only if it serves as an ascent bottom. We construct a bijection between ascent sequences and revised ascent sequences by adapting the classic hat map, which transforms ascent sequences into modified ascent sequences. Additionally, we investigate revised ascent sequences that avoid a single pattern, leading to a wealth of enumerative results. Our main techniques include the use of bijections, generating trees, generating functions, and the kernel method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permutation $\pi$ is said to avoid a chain $(\sigma:\tau)$ of patterns if $\pi$ avoids $\sigma$ and $\pi^2$ avoids $\tau.$ In this paper, we define a notion of pattern avoidance for compositions of positive integers and use that idea to enumerate permutations of length $n$ that avoid the chain $(312,321:\sigma)$ for any pattern $\sigma\in \bigcup_{m\geq 1} \mathcal{S}_m$. We also enumerate those permutations that avoid the chain $(312,4321:\sigma)$ for any $\sigma\in\mathcal{S}_3.$</description>

      <title>Coloring by Pushing Vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$, maximum degree at most $\Delta$, and no component of order $2$. Inspired by the famous 1-2-3-conjecture, Bensmail, Marcille, and Orenga define a proper pushing scheme of $G$ as a function $\rho:V(G)\to\mathbb{N}_0$ for which $$\sigma:V(G)\to\mathbb{N}_0:u\mapsto \left(1+\rho(u)\right)d_G(u)+\sum_{v\in N_G(u)}\rho(v)$$ is a vertex coloring, that is, adjacent vertices receive different values under $\sigma$. They show the existence of a proper pushing scheme $\rho$ with $\max\{ \rho(u):u\in V(G)\}\leq \Delta^2$ and conjecture that this upper bound can be improved to $\Delta$. We show their conjecture for cubic graphs and regular bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we show the existence of a proper pushing scheme $\rho$ with $\sum_{u\in V(G)}\rho(u)\leq \left(2\Delta^2+\Delta\right)n/6$.</description>

      <title>The Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the hypercube Q_n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The n-dimensional hypercube Q_n is a graph with vertex set {0,1}^n such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. Let H be a graph, and a graph is called H-free if it does not contain H as a subgraph. Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted by ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is H-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and joining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k vertices. We say a double star is a balanced double star if k = l. Currently, the Turan number of the balanced star S_{n,n} is has been studied in the planar graphs. In the hypercubes, the researchers look for the maximum number of edges of the graphs that are C_k-free. However, the Turan number of the double star in the hypercube remains unexplored. Building upon prior research, we initiate the first study on the Turan number of the balanced double star in the hypercube. In this paper, we give the exact value of the Turan number of the balanced double star S_{n-1,n-1} in the hypercube Q_n, which is 2^{n-3}*(4n- 3) for all n &gt;= 3.</description>

      <title>A Counterexample to a Conjecture of Lov\'asz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975 Lov\'{a}sz conjectured that every $r$-partite, $r$-uniform hypergraph contains $r-1$ vertices whose deletion reduces the matching number. If true, this statement would imply a well-known conjecture of Ryser from 1971, which states that every $r$-partite, $r$-uniform hypergraph has a vertex cover of size at most $r-1$ times its matching number. When $r=2$, Ryser's conjecture is simply K\H{o}nig's theorem, and the conjecture of Lov\'asz is an immediate corollary. Ryser's conjecture for $r=3$ was proven by Aharoni in 2001, and remains open for all $r\geq 4$.
  Here we show that the conjecture of Lov\'asz is false in the case $r=3$. Our counterexample is the line hypergraph of the Biggs-Smith graph, a highly symmetric cubic graph on 102 vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $S$, a set of $n$ points chosen uniformly at random and independently from the unit hypercube of dimension $t&gt;2$. Order $S$ by using the Cartesian product of the $t$ standard orders of $[0,1]$. We determine a constant $\bar x(t)&lt;e$ such that, with probability $\ge 1-\exp(-\Theta(\eps)n^{1/t})$, cardinality of a largest subset of comparable points is at most $(\bar x(t)+\eps)n^{1/t}$. The bound $\bar x(t)$ complements an explicit lower bound obtained by Bollob\'as and Winkler in 1982.</description>

      <title>Universality for transversal Hamilton cycles in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tuple $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ of graphs on the same vertex set of size $n$ is said to be Hamilton-universal if for every map $\chi: [n]\to[n]$ there exists a Hamilton cycle whose $i$-th edge comes from $G_{\chi(i)}$. Bowtell, Morris, Pehova and Staden proved an analog of Dirac's theorem in this setting, namely that if $\delta(G_i)\geq (1/2+o(1))n$ then $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ is Hamilton-universal. Combining McDiarmid's coupling and a colorful version of the Friedman-Pippenger tree embedding technique, we establish a similar result in the setting of sparse random graphs, showing that there exists $C$ such that if the $G_i$ are independent random graphs sampled from $G(n,p)$, where $p\geq C\log n/n$, then $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ is Hamilton-universal with high probability.</description>

      <title>Generalized chip firing and critical groups of arithmetical structures on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip firing provides a way to study the sandpile group (also known as the Jacobian) of a graph. We use a generalized version of chip firing to bound the number of invariant factors of the critical group of an arithmetical structure on a graph. We also show that, under appropriate hypotheses, critical groups are additive under wedge sums of graphs with arithmetical structures. We apply these results to relate the number of invariant factors of critical groups associated to any given tree to decompositions of the tree into simpler trees. We use this to classify those trees for which every arithmetical structure has cyclic critical group. Finally, we show how to construct arithmetical structures on trees with prescribed critical groups. In particular, every finite abelian group is realized as the critical group of some arithmetical structure on a tree.</description>

      <title>On flag-transitive automorphism groups of $2$-designs with $\lambda$ prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study $2$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ designs $\mathcal{D}$ with $\lambda$ prime admitting flag-transitive and point-primitive almost simple automorphism groups $G$ with socle $T$ a finite exceptional simple group or a sporadic simple groups. If the socle of $G$ is a finite exceptional simple group, then we prove that $\mathcal{D}$ is isomorphic to one of two infinite families of $2$-designs with point-primitive automorphism groups, one is the Suzuki-Tits ovoid design with parameter set $(v,b,r,k,\lambda)=(q^{2}+1,q^{2}(q^{2}+1)/(q-1),q^{2},q,q-1)$ design, where $q-1$ is a Mersenne prime, and the other is newly constructed in this paper and has parameter set $(v,b,r,k,\lambda)=(q^{3}(q^{3}-1)/2,(q+1)(q^{6}-1),(q+1)(q^{3}+1),q^{3}/2,q+1)$, where $q+1$ a Fermat prime. If $T$ is a sporadic simple group, then we show that $\mathcal{D}$ is isomorphic to a unique design admitting a point-primitive automorphism group with parameter set $(v,b,r,k,\lambda)=(176,1100,50,2)$, $(12,22,11,6,5)$ or $(22,77,21,6,5)$.</description>

      <title>A note on the irrationality of $\zeta_2(5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a spirit of Ap\'ery's proof of the irrationality of $\zeta(3)$, we construct a sequence $p_n/q_n$ of rational approximations to the $2$-adic zeta value $\zeta_2(5)$ which satisfy $0 &lt; |\zeta_2(5)-p_n/q_n|_2 &lt; \max\{|p_n|,|q_n|\}^{-1-\delta}$ for an explicit constant $\delta&gt;0$. This leads to a new proof of the irrationality of $\zeta_2(5)$, the result established recently by Calegari, Dimitrov and Tang using a different method. Furthermore, our approximations allow us to obtain an upper bound for the irrationality measure of this $2$-adic quantity; namely, we show that $\mu(\zeta_2(5)) \le (16\log2)/(8\log2-5) = 20.342\dots$.</description>

      <title>p-complete square-free Word-representation of Word-representable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V,E)$ is word-representable, if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that for letters ${x,y} \in V$ , $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if $xy$ is an edge in the graph $G$. In this paper, we introduce the concept of $p$-complete square-free word-representable graph $G(V,E)$. A word $w$ defined over alphabet $V$ is called $p$-complete square-free word if there does not exist any subset $S\subseteq \Sigma$ such that the word $w_{S}$ contains a square $XX$ where $|X| \ge p$ and $1\le p \le |w|/2$. A word-representable graph is considered $p$-complete square-free word-representable if there exists a $p$-complete square-free word-representant of that graph. This pattern is significant as it proves the existence of patterns that do not depend on graph labelling and cannot be avoided by certain classes of word-representable graphs. The class of word-representable graphs includes both $p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs and non-$p$-complete square-free word-representable graphs. Additionally, this concept generalises the square pattern found in the words. A word-representable graph is $p$-complete square-free uniform word-representable if its $p$-complete square-free word-representant is a uniform word. We analyse the properties of $p$-complete square-free uniform words and find that the graphs represented by these words avoid having $K_p$ (the complete graph on $p$ vertices) as an induced subgraph. We provide classifications for small values of $p$: for $p=1$, only complete graphs and for $p=2$, only complete and edgeless graphs satisfy the condition. We find that $K_3$-free circle graphs are 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable. Furthermore, we establish that only graphs with representation number at most 3 can be 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable and provide a constructive method to generate such graphs.</description>

      <title>Proper partial linear spaces affording imprimitive rank 3 automorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A partial linear space is a point--line incidence structure such that each line is incident with at least two points and each pair of points is incident with at most one line. It is said to be proper if there exists at least one non-collinear point pair, and at least one line incident with more than two points. The highest degree of symmetry for a proper partial linear space occurs when the automorphism group $G$ is transitive on ordered pairs of collinear points, and on ordered pairs of non-collinear points, that is to say, $G$ is a transitive rank $3$ group on the points. While the primitive rank 3 partial linear spaces are essentially classified, we present the first substantial classification of a family of imprimitive rank $3$ examples. We classify all imprimitive rank $3$ proper partial linear spaces such that the rank $3$ group is semiprimitive and induces an almost simple group on the unique nontrivial system of imprimitivity. In particular, this includes all partial linear spaces with a rank 3 imprimitive automorphism group that is innately transitive or quasiprimitive. We construct several infinite families of examples and ten individual examples. The examples admit a rank $3$ action of a linear or unitary group, and to our knowledge most of our examples have not appeared before in the literature.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $k$-hash distances and rates of linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we bound the rate of linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ with the property that any $k \leq q$ codewords are all simultaneously distinct in at least $d_k$ coordinates. For the particular case $d_k=1$, this leads to bounds on the rate of linear $q$-ary $k$-hash codes which generalize, with a simpler proof, results recently obtained for the case $q=k=3$ by Pohoata and Zakharov and by Bishnoi D'haeseleeer and Gijswijt. We finally discuss some related open problems on the list-decoding zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels.</description>

      <title>The geometry of zonotopal algebras II: Orlik--Terao algebras and Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zonotopal algebras, introduced by Postnikov--Shapiro--Shapiro, Ardila--Postnikov, and Holtz--Ron, show up in many different contexts, including approximation theory, representation theory, Donaldson--Thomas theory, and hypertoric geometry. In the first half of this paper, we construct a perfect pairing between the internal zonotopal algebra of a linear space and the reduced Orlik--Terao algebra of the Gale dual linear space. As an application, we prove a conjecture of Moseley--Proudfoot--Young that relates the reduced Orlik--Terao algebra of a graph to the cohomology of a certain configuration space. In the second half of the paper, we interpret the Macaulay inverse system of a zonotopal algebra as the space of sections of a sheaf on the Schubert variety of a linear space. As an application of this, we use an equivariant resolution of the structure sheaf of the Schubert variety inside of a product of projective lines to produce an exact sequence relating internal and external zonotopal algebras.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Markov property on planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit, in a self contained way, the Markov property on planar maps and decorated planar maps from three perspectives. First, we characterize the laws on these planar maps that satisfy both the Markov property and rerooting invariance, showing that they are Boltzmann-type maps. Second, we provide a comprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps, satisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to those obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated metric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length intervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on the edges. We define a probability measure on them that is the analogue of the Boltzmann map and show that it satisfies the Markov property even for sets that halt exploration mid-edge.</description>

      <title>On the Toughness of Regular Graphs and Prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We contribute results on $r$-regular graphs that do and don't have the maximum possible toughness, namely $r/2$. Doty and Ferland showed the existence of a $5$-regular graph with toughness $5/2$ for all even orders except $n= 18$. Using a computer search we show that there does not exist such a graph for $n=18$. Also, we provide the first family of $4$-regular graphs with toughness $2$ that contains claws. For the prism $G \Box K_2$ of a graph~$G$, we provide several bounds including a sufficient condition for the prism to have the same toughness as~$G$. In particular, we show that if $G$ has toughness $t\le \frac{1}{2}$ then its prism has toughness $2t$; further, the prism of any $r$-regular $r$-connected inflation has toughness~$r/2$ (despite being $(r+1)$-regular) and in general the prism of any $3$-regular graph has toughness at most~$3/2$.</description>

      <title>$k$-local Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017 Day et al. introduced the notion of locality as a structural complexity-measure for patterns in the field of pattern matching established by Angluin in 1980. In 2019 Casel et al. showed that determining the locality of an arbitrary pattern is NP-complete. Inspired by hierarchical clustering, we extend the notion to coloured graphs, i.e., given a coloured graph determine an enumeration of the colours such that colouring the graph stepwise according to the enumeration leads to as few clusters as possible. Next to first theoretical results on graph classes, we propose a priority search algorithm to compute the $k$-locality of a graph. The algorithm is optimal in the number of marking prefix expansions, and is faster by orders of magnitude than an exhaustive search. Finally, we perform a case study on a DBLP subgraph to demonstrate the potential of $k$-locality for knowledge discovery.</description>

      <title>Structure constants for spin Hall--Littlewood functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a combinatorial formula for the structure constants of spin Hall--Littlewood functions. This is achieved by representing these functions and the structure constants as the partition function of a lattice model and applying the underlying Yang--Baxter equation. Our combinatorial expression is in terms of generalised honeycombs; the latter were introduced by Knutson and Tao for ordinary Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and applied to the computation of Hall polynomials by Zinn--Justin.</description>

      <title>The Arboricity Polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new matroid (graph) invariant, the arboricity polynomial. Given a matroid, the arboricity polynomial enumerates the number of covers of the ground set by disjoint independent sets. We establish the polynomiality of the counting function as a special case of a scheduling polynomial, i.e. both in terms of quasisymmetric functions and via Ehrhart theory of the normal fan of the matroid base polytope. We show basic properties of the polynomial and demonstrate that it is not a Tutte invariant. Namely, the arboricity polynomial does not satisfy a contraction / deletion recursion.</description>

      <title>On a Generalisation of a Function of Ron Graham's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ron Graham introduced a function, $g(n)$, on the non-negative integers, in the 1986 Issue $3$ Problems column of \textit{Mathematical Magazine}: For each non-negative integer $n$, $g(n)$ is the least integer $s$ so that the integers $n + 1, n + 2, \ldots , s-1, s$ contain a subset of integers, the product of whose members with $n$ is a square. Recently, many results about $g(n)$ were proved in [Kagey and Rajesh, ArXiv:2410.04728, 2024] and they conjectured a characterization of which $n$ satisfied $g(n)=2n$. For $m\geq 2$, they also introduced generalizations of $g(n)$ to $m$-th powers to explore. In this paper, we prove their conjecture and provide some results about these generalisations.</description>
