      <title>Venice: a multi-scale operator-splitting algorithm for multi-physics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present {\sc Venice}, an operator splitting algorithm to integrate a numerical model on a hierarchy of timescales. {\sc Venice} allows a wide variety of different physical processes operating a different scales to be coupled on individual and adaptive time-steps. It therewith mediates the development of complex multi-scale and multi-physics simulation environments with a wide variety of independent components. The coupling between various physical models and scales is dynamic, and realized through (Strang) operators splitting using adaptive time steps. We demonstrate the functionality and performance of this algorithm using astrophysical models of a stellar cluster, first coupling gravitational dynamics and stellar evolution, then coupling internal gravitational dynamics with dynamics within a galactic background potential, and finally combining these models while also introducing dwarf galaxy-like perturbers. These tests show numerical convergence for decreasing coupling timescales, demonstrate how {\sc Venice} can improve the performance of a simulation by shortening coupling timescales when appropriate, and provide a case study of how {\sc Venice} can be used to gradually build up and tune a complex multi-physics model. Although the examples couple complete numerical models, {\sc Venice} can also be used to efficiently solve systems of stiff differential equations.</description>

      <title>Off-axis Hartmann wavefront sensing for the GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF) red camera optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hartmann test is a method used to measure the wavefront error in a focal optical system, wherein a mask with a pattern of small holes is placed at the system's aperture stop. By taking an image at a defocused plane, the differences between the ideal and real positions of the reimaged holes (called the transverse ray aberrations) can be measured, which can then be used to estimate the wavefront error. However, the Hartmann test is usually used with an on-axis field. In this paper, we present a wavefront sensing method which generalizes the classical Hartmann test for off-axis field angles and arbitrary reference wavefronts. Our method involves taking images at two defocused planes, and then using the real reimaged hole positions on both planes to estimate the trajectories of rays from the system's exit pupil, at which the reference wavefront is situated. We then propagate the rays forward from the reference wavefront to one of the two defocused planes, in order to find the ideal reimaged hole positions, from which we can compute transverse ray aberrations. We derive and solve a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations relating transverse ray aberrations to wavefront error, using Zernike decomposition and nonlinear least squares. Our method has been verified on simulated data from the 7-lens f/2.25 red camera system of the GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF), a high resolution optical echelle spectrograph which will be a first light instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT).</description>

      <title>Measurement and Modeling of Polarized Atmosphere at the South Pole with SPT-3G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection and characterization of fluctuations in linearly polarized emission from the atmosphere above the South Pole. These measurements make use of Austral winter survey data from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope in three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We use the cross-correlation between detectors to produce an unbiased estimate of the power in Stokes I, Q, and U parameters on large angular scales. Our results are consistent with the polarized signal being produced by the combination of Rayleigh scattering of thermal radiation from the ground and thermal emission from a population of horizontally aligned ice crystals with an anisotropic distribution described by Kolmogorov turbulence. The signal is most significant at large angular scales, high observing frequency, and low elevation angle. Polarized atmospheric emission has the potential to significantly impact observations on the large angular scales being targeted by searches for inflationary B-mode CMB polarization. We present the distribution of measured angular power spectrum amplitudes in Stokes Q and I for 4 years of winter observations, which can be used to simulate the impact of atmospheric polarization and intensity fluctuations at the South Pole on a specified experiment and observation strategy. For the SPT-3G data, downweighting the small fraction of significantly contaminated observations is an effective mitigation strategy. In addition, we present a strategy for further improving sensitivity on large angular scales where maps made in the 220 GHz band are used to measure and subtract the polarized atmosphere signal from the 150 GHz band maps. In observations with the SPT-3G instrument at the South Pole, the polarized atmospheric signal is a well-understood and sub-dominant contribution to the measured noise after implementing the mitigation strategies described here.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mass Reduction Capabilities of Additive Manufacturing through the Re-Design of a Space-Based Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacture (AM) involves creating a part layer by layer and is a rapidly evolving manufacturing process. It has multiple strengths that apply to space-based optics, such as the ability to consolidate multiple parts into one, reducing the number of interfaces. The process also allows for greater mass reduction, making parts more cost-effective to launch, achieved by optimising the shape for intended use or creating intricate geometries like lattices. However, previous studies have highlighted issues associated with the AM process. For example, when trying to achieve high-precision optical surfaces on AM parts, the latticing on the underside of mirrors can provide insufficient support during machining, resulting in the quilting effect.
  This paper builds on previous work and explores such challenges further. This will be implemented by investigating ways to apply AM to a deployable mirror from a CubeSat project called A-DOT. The reflective surface has a spherical radius of curvature of 682 mm and approximate external dimensions of 106 mm x 83 mm. The aim is to produce two mirrors that will take full advantage of AM design benefits and account for the challenges in printing and machining a near-net shape. The designs will have reduced mass by using selected internal lattice designs and topology-optimised connection points, resulting in two mirrors with mass reduction targets of 50% and 70%. Once printed in aluminium using laser powder bed fusion, the reflective surface will be created using single point diamond turning. Finally, an evaluation of the dimensional accuracy will be conducted, using interferometry, to quantify the performance of the reflective surface.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Prime-Cam Optics Overview and Status Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prime-Cam is a first-generation science instrument for the CCAT Observatory's six-meter aperture Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST). FYST's crossed-Dragone design provides high optical throughput to take advantage of its unique site at 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in Chile's Atacama Desert to reach mapping speeds over ten times greater than current and near-term submillimeter experiments. Housing up to seven independent instrument modules in its 1.8-meter diameter cryostat, Prime-Cam will combine broadband polarization-sensitive modules and spectrometer modules designed for observations in several frequency windows between 210 GHz and 850 GHz to study a wide range of astrophysical questions from Big Bang cosmology to the formation of stars and galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization and beyond. In order to cover this range of frequencies and observation modes, each of the modules contains a set of cold reimaging optics that is optimized for the science goals of that module. These optical setups include several filters, three or four anti-reflection-coated silicon lenses, and a Lyot stop to control the field of view and illumination of the primary mirror, satisfy a series of mechanical constraints, and maximize optical performance within each passband. We summarize the design considerations and trade-offs for the optics in these modules and provide a status update on the fabrication of the Prime-Cam receiver and the design of its 1 K and 100 mK thermal BUSs.</description>

      <title>Mitigating calibration errors from mutual coupling with time-domain filtering of 21 cm cosmological radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm transition from neutral Hydrogen promises to be the best observational probe of the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). This has led to the construction of low-frequency radio interferometric arrays, such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), aimed at systematically mapping this emission for the first time. Precision calibration, however, is a requirement in 21 cm radio observations. Due to the spatial compactness of HERA, the array is prone to the effects of mutual coupling, which inevitably lead to non-smooth calibration errors that contaminate the data. When unsmooth gains are used in calibration, intrinsically spectrally-smooth foreground emission begins to contaminate the data in a way that can prohibit a clean detection of the cosmological EoR signal. In this paper, we show that the effects of mutual coupling on calibration quality can be reduced by applying custom time-domain filters to the data prior to calibration. We find that more robust calibration solutions are derived when filtering in this way, which reduces the observed foreground power leakage. Specifically, we find a reduction of foreground power leakage by 2 orders of magnitude at k=0.5.</description>

      <title>A Short History of the First 50 Years: from the GRB Prompt Emission and Afterglow Discoveries to the Multimessenger Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than fifty years have been elapsed from the first discovery of a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) with the American Vela satellites, and more than twenty-five years from the discovery with the BeppoSAX satellite of the first X-ray afterglow of a GRB. Thanks to the afterglow discovery and to the possibility given to the optical and radio astronomers to discover the GRB optical counterparts, the long-time mystery about the origin of these events was solved. Now we know that GRBs are huge explosions, mainly ultra relativistic jets, in galaxies at cosmological distances. Starting from the first GRB detection with the Vela satellites, I will review the story of these discoveries, those obtained with BeppoSAX, the contribution to GRBs by other satellites and ground experiments, among them Venera, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, HETE2, Swift, Fermi, AGILE, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., which were, and some of them are still, very important for the study of GRB properties. Then I will review the main results obtained thus far and the still open problems and prospects of the GRB astronomy.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Inversion in Four Dimensions with Deep Learning (SPIn4D): I. Overview, Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling, and Stokes Profile Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multi-line spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our "SPIn4D" project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been conducted; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least $25\times25\times8$ Mm with $16\times16\times12$ km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe I lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available.</description>

Abstract: We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barb\'a 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barb\'a. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.</description>

      <title>On the use of field RR Lyrae as Galactic probes VII. light curve templates in the LSST photometric system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \textit{Vera C. Rubin} Observatory will start operations in 2025. During the first two years, too few visits per target per band will be available, meaning that mean magnitude measurements of variable stars will not be precise and thus, standard candles like RR Lyrae (RRL) will not be usable. Light curve templates (LCTs) can be adopted to estimate the mean magnitude of a variable star with few magnitude measurements, provided that their period (plus amplitude and reference epoch, depending on how the LCT is applied) is known. LSST will provide precise RRL periods within the first six months, allowing to exploit RRLs if LCTs were available.
  We aim to build LCTs in the LSST bands to enhance the early science with LSST. Using them will provide a 1-2 years advantage with respect to a classical approach, concerning distance measurements.
  We collected $gri$-band data from the ZTF survey and $z$-band data from DECam to build the LCTs of RRLs. We also adopted synthetic $griz$-band data in the LSST system from pulsation models, plus SDSS, \gaia and OGLE photometry, inspecting the light amplitude ratios in different photometric systems to provide useful conversions to apply the LCTs.
  We have built LCTs of RRLs in the $griz$ bands of the LSST photometric system; for the $z$ band, we could build only fundamental-mode RRL LCTs. We quantitatively demonstrated that LCTs built with ZTF and DECam data can be adopted on the LSST photometric system. LCTs will decrease by a factor of at least two the uncertainty on distance estimates of RRLs, with respect to a simple average of the available measurements. Finally, within our tests, we have found a brand new behavior of amplitude ratios in the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>Measurement of differential collisional excitation cross sections for the K$\alpha$ emission of He-like oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the energy-differential cross sections for collisional excitation of the soft X-ray electric-dipole K$\alpha$ ($x+y+w$) emission from He-like oxygen (O VII), using an electron beam ion trap. Values near their excitation thresholds were extracted from the observed emissivity by rapidly cycling the energy of the exciting electron beam. This allows us to subtract time-dependent contributions of the forbidden $z$-line emission to the multiplet. We develop a time-dependent collisional-radiative model to further demonstrate the method and predict all spectral features. We then compare the extracted $x+y+w$ cross-sections with calculations based on distorted-wave and R-matrix methods from the literature and our own predictions using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). All R-matrix results are validated by our measurements of direct and resonant excitation, supporting the use of such state-of-the-art codes for astrophysical and plasma physics diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Catalog-based pseudo-$C_\ell$s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formalism to extract the angular power spectrum of fields sampled at a finite number of points with arbitrary positions -- a common situation for several catalog-based astrophysical probes -- through a simple extension of the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ algorithm. A key complication in this case is the need to handle the shot noise component of the associated discrete angular mask which, for sparse catalogs, can lead to strong coupling between very different angular scales. We show that this problem can be solved easily by estimating this contribution analytically and subtracting it. The resulting estimator is immune to small-scale pixelization effects and aliasing, and, more interestingly, unbiased against the contribution from measurement noise uncorrelated between different sources. We demonstrate the validity of the method in the context of cosmic shear datasets, and showcase its usage in the case of other spin-0 and spin-1 astrophysical fields of interest. We incorporate the method in the public $\texttt{NaMaster}$ code (https://github.com/LSSTDESC/NaMaster).</description>

      <title>Design and Sensitivity of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.12279v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents the design of the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G) and discusses its scientific prospects. Using an array of radio sensors, RNO-G seeks to measure neutrinos above 10 PeV by exploiting the Askaryan effect in neutrino-induced cascades in ice. We discuss the experimental considerations that drive the design of RNO-G, present first measurements of the hardware that is to be deployed and discuss the projected sensitivity of the instrument. RNO-G will be the first production-scale radio detector for in-ice neutrino signals.</description>

      <title>Comparative laboratory study of electric field conjugation algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future space telescope coronagraph instruments hinge on the integration of high-performance masks and precise wavefront sensing and control techniques to create dark holes essential for exoplanet detection. Recent advancements in wavefront control algorithms might exhibit differing performance depending on the coronagraph used. This research investigates three model-free and model-based algorithms in conjunction with either a vector vortex coronagraph or a scalar vortex coronagraph under identical laboratory conditions: pairwise probing with electric field conjugation, the self-coherent camera with electric field conjugation, and implicit electric field conjugation. We present experimental results in narrowband and broadband light from the In-Air Coronagraph Testbed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We find that model-free dark hole digging methods achieve comparable broadband contrasts to model-based methods, and highlight the calibration costs of model-free methods compared to model-based approaches. This study also reports the first time that electric field conjugation with the self-coherent camera has been applied for simultaneous multi-subband correction with a field stop. This study compares the advantages and disadvantages of each of these wavefront sensing and control algorithms with respect to their potential for future space telescopes.</description>

      <title>Continued developments in X-ray speed reading: fast, low noise readout for next-generation wide-field imagers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future strategic X-ray astronomy missions will require unprecedentedly sensitive wide-field imagers providing high frame rates, low readout noise and excellent soft energy response. To meet these needs, our team is employing a multi-pronged approach to advance several key areas of technology. Our first focus is on advanced readout electronics, specifically integrated electronics, where we are collaborating on the VERITAS readout chip for the Athena Wide Field Imager, and have developed the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC), which enables fast readout and high frame rates for MIT-LL JFET (junction field effect transistor) CCDs. Second, we are contributing to novel detector development, specifically the SiSeRO (Single electron Sensitive Read Out) devices fabricated at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and their advanced readout, to achieve sub-electron noise performance. Hardware components set the stage for performance, but their efficient utilization relies on software and algorithms for signal and event processing. Our group is developing digital waveform filtering and AI methods to augment detector performance, including enhanced particle background screening and improved event characterization. All of these efforts make use of an efficient, new X-ray beamline facility at Stanford, where components and concepts can be tested and characterized.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for assessing climatological surface habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary surface habitability has so far been, in the main, considered in its entirety. The increasing popularity of 3D modelling studies of (exo)planetary climate has highlighted the need for a more nuanced understanding of surface habitability. Using satellite-derived data of photosynthetic life to represent the observed surface habitability of modern Earth, we validate a set of climatologically-defined metrics previously used in exoplanetary habitability studies. The comparison finds that the metrics defined by temperature show spatial patterns of habitability distinct to those defined by aridity, with no metric able to completely replicate the observed. We build upon these results to introduce a new metric defined by the observed thermal limits of modern Earth-based life, along with surface water fluxes as an analogue for water and nutrient availability. Furthermore, we pay attention to not only the thermal bounds of macroscopic complex life, but additionally the limits of microbial life which have been vital to the generation of Earth's own biosignatures, thus expanding considerations of climatic habitability out of a historically binary definition. Repeating the validation for our metric finds a significant improvement in the spatial representation of habitability, laying the groundwork for more accurate assessments of potential life-supporting environments upon other planets.</description>
