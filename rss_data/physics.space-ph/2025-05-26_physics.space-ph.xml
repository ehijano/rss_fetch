      <title>Attitude Control of Solar Sail with Reflectivity Control Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar sails offer a promising solution for fuel free propulsion, enabling novel mission profiles and deeper space exploration. While reaction wheels are standard for spacecraft attitude control, the large moment of inertia of solar sails often lead to frequent reaction wheel saturation, necessitating momentum offloading via additional control methods. Magnetorquers have historically been used for this purpose. This paper investigates Reflectivity Control Devices (RCDs) as an alternative method for momentum management, aiming to prevent reaction wheel saturation. A dynamic model of a solar sail in a Sun synchronous orbit is developed, incorporating disturbance torques to assess control. Numerical simulations evaluate the effectiveness of RCDs in offloading reaction wheel momentum and preventing saturation. The results indicate additional applications for RCDs in Earth orbit as well as potential for deep space missions where magnetorquers cannot be used.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Turbulence Characteristics of Fast and Slow Coronal Mass Ejections at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the thermal and turbulence properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is essential for analyzing their evolution and interactions with the surrounding medium. This study explores these characteristics across different regions of two distinct ICMEs observed at 1 AU, utilizing in-situ measurements from the Wind spacecraft. The polytropic indices, Gamma_e for electrons and Gamma_p for protons) reveal significant deviations from adiabatic expansion, suggesting sustained heating mechanisms within the ICMEs even at 1AU. The effective polytropic index (Gamma_eff) of the magnetic ejecta (ME) in both ICME1 and ICME2 is found to be near-isothermal (Gamma_eff = 0.88 and 0.76), aligning with measurements near the Sun, highlighting consistent heating across heliospheric distances. Spectral analysis at the inertial scale reveals Kolmogorov-like turbulence in the fast ICME1's ME, while the ME of the slower ICME2 exhibits less developed turbulence with a shallower spectral index (alpha_B). The turbulence analysis in the dissipation scale indicates that the ME of slower ICME2 is less affected by the ambient medium than the faster ICME2. The MEs of both ICMEs show magnetic compressibility much smaller than unity (C_B &lt; 1), suggesting dominant Alfvenic fluctuations in the MEs. Notably, the partial variance of increments (PVI) method identifies more intermittent structures, such as current sheets and reconnection sites, in the sheath and post-ICME regions. Higher PVI values correlate with regions of increased electron and proton temperature (for the sheath region), as well as higher C_B values, highlighting their role in local energy dissipation. These results underscore the importance of ongoing heating and turbulence processes in shaping the evolution of ICMEs.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Solar Cycle Influence on Long-Term Orbital Deterioration of Low-Earth Orbiting Space Debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of space debris represents a substantial threat to the sustained viability of space operations and underscores the importance of understanding long-term drivers of orbital decay. This first of its kind study examines the long-term impact of solar activity on the orbital decay of 17 LEO debris objects across Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24 using Two-Line Element (TLE) data spanning these three cycles. Analysis of TLE-derived decay profiles, in conjunction with sunspot numbers (SSN) and F10.7 index, reveals a threshold: orbital decay rates increase sharply when SSN exceeds approximately 67-75% of its cycle peak. This threshold corresponds to enhanced thermospheric density driven by elevated solar input, resulting in increased atmospheric drag. The orbital decay rates at the peak of each solar cycle show a progressive decline from Cycle 22 to Cycle 24, mirroring the corresponding decrease in solar activity. Decay profiles for Solar Cycle 24, predicted using ballistic coefficients derived from TLE data during Cycles 22 and 23 and atmospheric densities from the MSIS 2.0 model, show strong agreement with observations after applying a scaling factor. However, two high-inclination objects exhibited significant deviations, highlighting limitations in the MSIS model's ability to represent atmospheric conditions at high latitudes. In contrast, lower-inclination objects showed excellent correspondence. Overall, the findings confirm solar-driven thermospheric variability as the dominant factor influencing long-term orbital decay and emphasize the need to refine atmospheric models-particularly for polar regions-to improve re-entry predictions and satellite mission planning.</description>
