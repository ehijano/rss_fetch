      <title>Designing (higher) Hall crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel platform for realizing interaction-induced Hall crystals with diverse Chern numbers $C$. This platform consists of a two-dimensional semiconductor or graphene subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field and a one-dimensional modulation, which can be realized by moir\'e or dielectric engineering. We show that interactions drive the system to spontaneously break the residual translational symmetry, resulting in Hall crystals with various $C$ (including $|C|&gt;1$). Remarkably, these phases persist across continuous ranges of filling and magnetic field, and the global phase diagram can be understood in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>Half-quantized Hall Plateaus in the Confined Geometry of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the ground-breaking discovery of the quantum Hall effect, half-quantized quantum Hall plateaus have been some of the most studied and sought-after states. Their importance stems not only from the fact that they transcend the composite fermion framework used to explain fractional quantum Hall states (such as Laughlin states). Crucially, they hold promise for hosting non-Abelian excitations, which are essential for developing topological qubits - key components for fault-tolerant quantum computing. In this work, we show that these coveted half-quantized plateaus can appear in more than one unexpected way. We report the observation of fractional states with conductance quantization at $\nu_H = 5/2$ arising due to charge equilibration in the confined region of a quantum point contact in monolayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependence of the mechanical properties of piezoelectric high-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators made from aluminium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors ($Q_m$) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-$Q_m$ nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase $Q_m$. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from 45nm to 295nm, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below 200nm thickness exhibit the highest $Q_m\cdot f_m$-product, on the order of $10^{12}$Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher $Q_m\cdot f_m$-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</description>

      <title>Interband spectroscopy of Landau levels and magnetoexcitons in bulk black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional systems based on black phosphorus (BP) have recently attracted much interest. Since the crystal structure of BP consists of 2D layers with a strong in-plane anisotropy, its electronic properties at a high magnetic field ($B$) are quite interesting. Here, we report a magneto-optical study of bulk BP at high $B$ to 12 T perpendicular to the 2D layers. In the obtained optical conductivity spectra, periodic peaks are clearly observed corresponding to Landau levels of up to $n$=6 quantum number. They exhibit almost linear shifts with $B$, and from their analysis an electron-hole reduced mass of 0.13 $m_0$ is obtained, where $m_0$ is the electron mass. Many of the peaks appear in pairs, which is interpreted in terms of Zeeman splitting and an electron-hole combined $g$-factor of 6.6 is obtained. In addition, magnetoexciton peaks are observed to shift quadratically with $B$, and the exciton binding energy at $B$=0 is estimated to be 9.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Unconventional topological phase transition of the Hopf insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological phase transition between two band insulators is mediated by a gapless state whose low-energy band structure normally contains sufficient information for describing the topology change. In this work, we show that there is a class of topological insulators whose topological phase transition cannot be explained by this conventional paradigm. Taking the Hopf insulator as a representative example, we show that the change of the Hopf invariant requires the information of wave functions as well as the gapless band structure simultaneously. More explicitly, the description of the Hopf invariant change requires us to trace not only the trajectory of Weyl points but also the evolution of the preimages for two distinct eigenstates. We show that such an unconventional topological phase transition originates from the fact that the Hopf invariant is well-defined when all the lower dimensional topological invariants are trivial, which in turn allows us to lift the classifying space of occupied state projectors to the corresponding universal 2-covering space of wave functions. Generalizing our theory to inversion-symmetric 10-fold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, we provide a complete list of symmetry classes, all of which turn out to have delicate band topology related to the Hopf invariant, where similar unconventional topological phase transitions can appear.</description>

      <title>Topological magnon zero-modes in dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets in the presence of crystalline lattice dislocations are investigated. We show the existence of topologically protected non-propagative modes that localize at dislocations. These in-gap states, coined as {\it magnonic zero-modes}, are characterized by the $Z_2$ topological invariant that derives from parity symmetry broken induced by sublattice magnetic anisotropy. We uncover that bulk topology existing in the perfect crystal is robust under the influence of lattice defects, which is monitored by the real-space Bott index. It is also revealed that the topology of zero-modes remains unaffected when bulk topology becomes trivial and is remarkably resilient against magnetic disorder. Our findings point to the intriguing relationship between topological lattice defects and the spectrum of topological spin excitations.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent conductivity of nanometric semiconductor thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanomenters thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

      <title>Anomalous length dependent conductance of quasi-one-dimensional molecular wires assembled from metal superatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular wires with high electrical conductance are desirable components for future molecular-scale circuitry. However, their conductance typically decays exponentially with increasing length. Here, we report a novel discovery that the conductivity of a nanoscale molecular wire assembled from metal superatoms increases with length. Specifically, high-precision first-principles calculations show that, while the conductance of quasi-one-dimensional superatomic assemblies formed with individual W@Cu12 superatoms as units exhibits a slow decay with increasing length, by extending the quasi-one-dimensional superatomic assemblies into bundle-like structures, their electrical conductivity increases with length, accompanied by a change in the corresponding decay factor from 1.25 nm-1 to -0.95 nm-1. This significant change in the decay factor originates from that the Fermi level of the superatomic assemblies shifts closer to the Fermi level of the electrodes, thereby reducing the tunneling barrier. Our findings highlight that molecular-scale devices exhibiting a negative decay factor are not an inherent characteristic, but rather can be regulated through structural modulation. This work not only provides theoretical references for modulating the performance of molecular-scale circuitry, but also opens up the application prospect of metal superatoms in electrical transport field.</description>

      <title>Topological flat bands and higher-order topology in square-octagon lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive recent research on Lieb and kagome lattices highlights their unique physics characterized by the coexistence of Dirac points, van Hove singularities, and flat bands. In these models, flat bands are typically pinned at the center of the Lieb spectrum or the extrema of kagome bands, offering limited tunability. In this work, we investigate the square-octagon lattice and demonstrate that flat bands generated through next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoppings can be tuned with intercell hoppings or staggered magnetic fluxes. Importantly, the introduction of staggered magnetic fluxes leads to the emergence of a Chern insulator phase and a higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) state at half-filling. An appropriate magnetic flux combined with NNN hopping can generate topological flat bands in the Chern insulator phase, exhibiting nontrivial Chern number and chiral edge states. The HOTI phase, in contrast, is characterized by topological corner states with quantized quadrupole moment within the bulk and edge states gap. We also present phase diagrams for the square-octagon lattice as functions of NNN and intercell hoppings under staggered magnetic fluxes. Our results indicate that the square-octagon lattice offers a promising platform for realizing topological flat bands, HOTI, and other topological and nontopological phases.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Driven Transitions Between Novel Magnetic States in Ferromagnetic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials hosting stable topological spin textures have demonstrated energy efficiency and potential as information carriers in novel logic and memory devices, offering an alternative to magnetic tunnel junction technology. While these structures are well understood in 2D, in 3D their stability, interactions, and topological transitions require further exploration. Here we present two thermodynamically stable topological states, termed the "hourglass" and "dome", in centrosymmetric magnetic films of varying thickness. Crucially, we observe thickness-dependent transitions between the two states, with regions of metastability where both configurations coexist. We construct a phase diagram detailing the parameter space for their existence and transitions, provide an effective description of the interactions that mediate the transition, and discuss the implications of this type of state switching.</description>

      <title>A non-magnetic mechanism of backscattering in helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction-induced backscattering mechanism for helical edge states of a two dimensional topological insulator which is tunnel-coupled to a puddle located near the edge channel. The mechanism does not involve inelastic scattering and is due to the zero-mode fluctuations in a puddle. We discuss in detail a simple model of a puddle - a cavity in the bulk of the topological insulator. Such a cavity also has helical edge states which are tunnel-coupled with helical states encompassing the topological insulator. We analyze effect of the edge current in the puddle. Although averaged value of this current is equal to zero, its zero-mode fluctuations act, in the presence of electron-electron interaction, similar to magnetic flux thus allowing backscattering processes, which involve tunneling through the puddle. Rectification of these fluctuations leads to a finite probability of backscattering. This effect is further enhanced due to dephasing process which is also dominated by zero-mode fluctuations. Remarkably, for temperature exceeding level spacing in the puddle, the rate of backscattering does not depend on temperature in a good agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Fast, Accurate, and Local Temperature Control Using Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum heat engines, and quantum sensors, rely on operating conditions in the subkelvin regime. It is therefore desirable to develop practical tools and methods for the precise control of the temperature in nanoscale quantum systems. Here, we present a proposal for fast, accurate, and local temperature control using qubits, which regulate the flow of heat between a quantum system and its thermal environment. The qubits are kept in a thermal state with a temperature that is controlled in an interplay between work done on the qubits by changing their energy splittings and the flow of heat between the qubits and the environment. Using only a few qubits, it is possible to control the thermal environment of another quantum system, which can be heated or cooled by the qubits. As an example, we show how a quantum system at subkelvin temperatures can be significantly and accurately cooled on a nanosecond timescale. Our proposal can potentially be realized with superconducting flux qubits, charge qubits, or spin qubits, which can now be fabricated and manipulated with exquisite control.</description>

      <title>Distinct moir\'e Exciton dynamics in WS2/ WSe2 heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter reports a time resolved pump-probe reflectance spectroscopic study on moir\'e excitons in a twisted monolayer WS2/WSe2 heterostructure. By probing at the resonant energies of intralayer excitons, we observed their distinct temporal tracks under the influence of interlayer excitons, which we attribute to the discrepancy in spatial distribution of the intralayer excitons in different layers. We also observed that intralayer moir\'e excitons in WSe2 layer differ at decay rate, which reflects different locations of Wannier-like and charge-transfer intralayer excitons in a moir\'e cell. We concluded that the interlayer moir\'e excitons form within a few picoseconds and have the lifetime exceeding five nanoseconds. Our results provide insights into the nature of moir\'e excitons and the strain's significant impact on their behaviour in twisted heterostructures, which could have important implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Impact of the impurity symmetry on orbital momentum relaxation and orbital Hall effect studied by the quantum Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum Boltzman equation approach that incorporates microscopic impurity models into the theory of orbital transport, revealing, how impurity properties, including their symmetry, influence the relaxation of orbital momentum and the orbital Hall effect. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the impurity potential has axial symmetry, the relaxation is governed by the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism. In contrast, when this symmetry is broken, scattering can result in a rapid Elliot-Yafet relaxation of orbital momentum. The details of impurity potential also affect the intrinsic orbital Hall effect even when the impurity concentration is very small. Impurities that alter the orbital texture can also give rise to a skew-scattering contribution to the orbital Hall effect, although this does not necessarily dominate in materials that are nearly pristine due to the Dyakonov-Perel relaxation.</description>

      <title>Transition between cooperative emission regimes in giant perovskite nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between emitters within an ensemble can give rise to cooperative processes that significantly alter the properties of the emitted light. One such process is superfluorescence (SF), where excited electric dipoles spontaneously couple coherently and effectively radiate as one macroscopic emitter. It requires low energetic disorder, high temporal coherence and oscillator strength, and sub-wavelength volumes of material can be sufficient. Conversely, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) originates from an avalanche-like stimulated amplification of initially spontaneously emitted photons and does not necessitate temporally coherent interactions among the emitters, but rather requires spatially long enough light propagation within the material to harvest the optical gain. Cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the very few materials where both ASE (in disordered films) and SF (in ordered assemblies) were observed, however leaving unclear whether and how these regimes could be connected. Here, we demonstrate that temperature and excitation density can drive the transition between both regimes in a thin film of giant CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs. At temperatures below 45 K, excitonic SF was observed, whereas above a transition range between 45 K and 100 K, ASE prevails, but requires increased optical excitation and emitter density. Our results work out the different collective effects present in lead halide perovskites, providing fundamental insights into cooperative phenomena and important guidance for the development of compact and bright (quantum) light sources.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transport theory at the order of quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport and attracted tremendous interest. We show that the quantum metric is only a tip of the iceberg, by deriving unknown 11 out of 14 formulas of the quadratic nonlinear conductivity under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges. The formulas allow us to determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for the magnetic point groups, calculate the quadratic nonlinear conductivity for arbitrary Hamiltonian, e.g., the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films with and without the $C_{3}$ symmetry, and formulate scaling laws at the order of quantum metric to distinguish different mechanisms in the recent experiments. The theory is a comprehensive description of the quadratic nonlinear transport and will facilitate future experiments and applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic conductivity for the type-I and type-II phases of Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelctric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect for the topological semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ due to the antiferromagnetic coupling of the bulk and surface spin-polarized phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate magnetocaloric effect for the topological magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ in a wide temperature range. The isothermal magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$ is calculated from the experimental magnetization curves by using Maxwell relation. In addition to the expected $\Delta S$ peak at the Curie temperature $T_C$, we obtain another one at the temperature $T_{inv}$ of the hysteresis inversion, which is the main experimental result. The inverted hysteresis usually originates from the antiferromagnetic coupling between two magnetic phases. For Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ topological magnetic Weyl semimetal these phases are the ferromagnetic bulk and the spin-polarized topological surface states. Thus, the pronounced magnetocaloric effect at $T_{inv}$ is determined by the bulk magnetization switching by the exchange bias field of the surface spin-polarizad phase, in contrast to the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition at the Curie temperature $T_C$. For possible applications of magnetocaloric effect, Weyl semimetals open a new way to shift from ferromagnetic to the antiferromagnetic systems without loss of efficiency, but with higher reversibility and with smaller energy costs.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of topological semimetals with bicircularly polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of illumination of bicircularly polarized light (BCL) on topological semimetals, namely multifold fermion and line-node semimetals. We demonstrate, by means of both low-energy and lattice models, that the band-structures of both multifold fermions and line-node semimetal exhibit rich features with BCL illumination. For multifold fermions, we show that if the relative amplitude, $r$, between the two frequency components of the BCL is related to the relative frequency, $\eta$, in such a way that $r^2 = \eta$, then the band touching points remain unchanged without any shift or band gap opening for any choice of the material-dependent parameters. For other choices of the BCL parameters, we find both gapped phases as well as gapless phases with shifted band touching points. Line-node semimetals also exhibit diverse phases, ranging from protected line-nodes under illumination to point nodes, by tuning the BCL parameters $r$ and $\eta$. Overall, our analytical and numerical results establish BCL as a versatile tool for obtaining tunable topological phases.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall currents from optical excitation of Landau transitions in bulk GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study anomalous Hall currents in magnetically-biased bulk GaAs samples under the formation of Landau levels. The anomalous Hall currents are generated by ultrafast optical excitation of spin-polarized carriers and detected by time-resolved measurements of the simultaneously emitted THz radiation. We find that the anomalous Hall currents peak for optical transitions between the band extrema of Landau levels of valance and conduction bands. These discrete features are attributed to the energy dependence of the geometric phases being responsible for anomalous transport effects in a semiconductor bandstructure. Surprisingly, we even detect the discrete Landau band transitions at room temperature, most likely due to the ultrafast local probing realized in our experiment. An analysis of the THz spectra using a model, based on the Boltzmann transport equation of optically excited carriers, shows that electron and hole contributions lead to complex current dynamics. While the cyclotronic motion of electrons results in a dip in the THz spectral response of anomalous Hall currents, it causes a peak in the spectral response of normal Hall currents. Additionally, our experimental results strongly suggest that the Landau levels of the valance band play a significant role in the generation of anomalous Hall currents. We expect that our results will initiate further studies on Berry-phase effects in Landau bands.</description>

      <title>Topological Insulator in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterotrilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall effect has been predicted in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) owing to the layer-pseudospin magnetic field. Recently, experimental observations have also confirmed such topological states of matter. However, the topological electronic properties in multilayer moir\'e superlattices remain to be further explored. In twisted TMDs heterotrilayers, the realization of moir\'e potential with various symmetries becomes feasible. Here, we demonstrate that twisted trilayer TMDs can enter a topological insulator phase under the influence of moir\'e potential with ${C_6}$ symmetry. Specifically, we built two types of trilayer heterostructures, where the low-energy valence band electrons are contributed by the middle layer. In the AA-stacked moir\'e WS$_2$/WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$ heterotrilayers where only the middle layer is twisted, the maxima of the moir\'e potential exhibits an approximate ${C_6}$ symmetry. The $C_6$ symmetry effectively compensates for the spatial inversion symmetry breaking in the WSe$_2$ layer, leading to a twist-angle-dependent topological phase transition. Leveraging a Green's function approach, we calculate the local state density of edge states at topological minigaps, confirming their nature as moir\'e edge states. In the helical twisted AA-stacked moir\'e MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$ heterotrilayers, we observed a mosaic pattern of topological and trivial insulators. The emergence of topological mosaic is attributed to the maxima of the local moir\'e potential possessing $C_6$ symmetry. The results provide a new way for the experimental realization of topological phases in TMDs heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization and discrete shift from boundary and corner charge in crystalline Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown how topological phases of matter with crystalline symmetry and $U(1)$ charge conservation can be partially characterized by a set of many-body invariants, the discrete shift $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$ and electric polarization $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$, where $\text{o}$ labels a high symmetry point. Crucially, these can be defined even with non-zero Chern number and/or magnetic field. One manifestation of these invariants is through quantized fractional contributions to the charge in the vicinity of a lattice disclination or dislocation. In this paper, we show that these invariants can also be extracted from the length and corner dependence of the total charge (mod 1) on the boundary of the system. We provide a general formula in terms of $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$ and $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$ for the total charge of any subregion of the system which can include full boundaries or bulk lattice defects, unifying boundary, corner, disclination, and dislocation charge responses into a single general theory. These results hold for Chern insulators, despite their gapless chiral edge modes, and for which an unambiguous definition of an intrinsically two-dimensional electric polarization has been unclear until recently. We also discuss how our theory can fully characterize the topological response of quadrupole insulators.</description>

      <title>Flatbands from Bound States in the Continuum for Orbital Angular Momentum Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flatband material is a system characterized by energy bands with zero dispersion, allowing for the compact localization of wavefunctions in real space. This compact localization significantly enhances inter-particle correlations and light-matter interactions, leading to notable advancements such as fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter systems and flat-band lasers in photonics. Previous flatband platforms, including twisted bilayer graphene and artificial kagome/Lieb lattices, typically focused on nondegenerate flatbands, lacking access to the high degeneracy that can facilitate the localization of orbital angular momentum (OAM). Here, we propose a general framework to construct highly degenerate flatbands from bound states in the continuum (BICs)--a concept originating from quantum theory but significantly developed in photonics and acoustics in recent years. The degeneracy of flatbands is determined by the number of BICs within each unit cell in a lattice. We experimentally validate this approach in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) acoustic crystals, demonstrating flatbands with 4-fold and 12-fold degeneracies, respectively. The high degeneracy provides sufficient internal degrees of freedom, enabling the selective excitation of localized OAM at any position in any direction. Our results pave the way for exploring BIC-constructed flatbands and their localization properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent rapid advances in quantum nanoplasmonics offer the potential for accessing quantum phenomena at room temperature. Despite this, entangled states have not yet been realised, and remain an outstanding challenge. In this work, we demonstrate how entanglement emerges in plasmonic nanocavities, which are inherently multi-mode, and demonstrate the conditions necessary for entanglement to persist. We find that, in general, these conditions are broken due to coupling with multiple plasmonic modes of different parity. We address this challenge with a new nanocavity design that supports high selective coupling to a single mode, enabling the robust generation of subradiant entanglement in nanoplasmonics. Our results open exciting prospects for leveraging simple plasmonic setups in ambient conditions for applications in quantum communication, sensing and rapid quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Recipe for observing immediate entanglement death-birth transition through Bell states with environmental Heisenberg exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environment is known to play a dual role in both extinguishing and establishing entanglement, leading to entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB). In this paper, we propose a recipe for the initial states of two qubits to undergo ESD, ESB, or transition of finite duration (TFD) between them. While this recipe is generic, a spin-star model coupled to the environment via Heisenberg exchange is chosen for illustration. Utilizing the Bell states, we introduce the entanglement switch parameter (ESP), whose sign indicates whether the qubit bipartite entanglement is switched on or off. The classical (quantum) weighting of the Bell states encodes the ESP for initial mixed (pure) states. When more than two Bell states are adopted, the ESP permits states to penetrate through the entanglement-unentanglement boundary. In this case, the penetrability of a small ESP ensures the immediate occurrence of ESD or ESB and indicates the TFD if the local time-even symmetry in the entanglement monotone is also satisfied. When no more than two Bell states are employed, the penetrability is lost, and TFD is only identified in some mixed states but not in pure states. For pure states, the environmental quantum degrees of freedom are associated with the number of Bell states. Thanks to the simplicity of this model, analytic results are provided. We also analyze the symmetries that can convert or alter ESD into ESB, and vice versa. The recipe enhances the controllability of entanglement dynamics and facilitates entanglement engineering.</description>

      <title>Passivity constraints on the relations between transmission, reflection, and absorption eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the passivity constraints on the relations between transmission, reflection, and absorption eigenvalues in linear time-invariant systems. Using techniques from matrix analysis, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the permissible combinations of these eigenvalues. Our analysis reveals that the set of allowable eigenvalue combinations forms a convex polyhedron in eigenvalue space, characterized by a trace equality and a set of linear inequalities. Surprisingly, we uncover a direct connection between this physical problem and Alfred Horn's inequalities, a fundamental result in matrix theory. We provide explicit examples for systems with varying numbers of input ports, demonstrating the increasing complexity of the constraints as system size grows. We apply our theory to analyze the implications of important phenomena, including open and closed channels, coherent perfect reflection and reflectionless scattering modes, and coherent perfect absorption and coherent zero absorption. Our findings not only offer a complete characterization of passivity constraints on wave transport eigenvalues but also establish an unexpected bridge between fundamental wave physics and advanced matrix theory, opening new avenues for research at their intersection. These results have significant implications for the design and optimization of passive wave devices across a wide range of applications in optics, acoustics, and mesoscopic physics.</description>

      <title>Spotting structural defects in crystals from the topology of vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of the inevitably disordered background, structural defects are not well-defined concepts in amorphous solids. In order to overcome this difficulty, it has been recently proposed that topological defects can be still identified in the pattern of vibrational modes, by looking at the corresponding eigenvector field at low frequency. Moreover, it has been verified that these defects strongly correlate with the location of soft spots in glasses, that are the regions more prone to plastic rearrangements. Here, we show that the topology of vibrational modes predicts the location of structural defects in crystals as well, including the cases of dislocations, disclinations and Eshelby inclusions. Our results suggest that in crystalline solids topological defects in the vibrational modes are directly connected to the well-established structural defects governing plastic deformations and present characteristics very similar to those observed in amorphous solids.</description>

Abstract: A particle-hole symmetry protected 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is investigated. This version differs from the usual Hermitian version by the inclusion of gain and/or loss terms which are represented by complex on-site potentials. The exceptional points occur, when the dimensionless potential magnitude and the hopping amplitudes become close to unity, leading to the coalescence of eigenvalues and nontrivial eigenvector degeneracies. Furthermore, the vectored Zak phase quantization has been obtained and a topolectric RLC circuit has been analysed. If realized experimentally (in photonic and acoustic crystals), the quantization is expected to lead to an extended bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>STIRAP-Inspired Robust Gates for a Superconducting Dual-Rail Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: STImulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) is a powerful technique for robust state transfer capabilities in quantum systems. This method, however encounters challenges for its implementation as a gate in qubit-subspace due to its sensitivity to initial states. By incorporating single-photon detuning into the protocol, the sensitivity to the initial state can effectively be mitigated, enabling STIRAP to operate as a gate. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the implementation of robust $\pi$ and $\pi$/2 rotations in a dual-rail qubit formed by two strongly coupled fixed-frequency transmon qubits. We achieve state preparation fidelity in excess of 0.98 using such rotations. Our analysis reveals these gates exhibit significant resilience to errors. Furthermore, our numerical calculations confirm that these gates can achieve fidelity levels in excess of 0.999.

      <title>Observation of converse flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals</title>

Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Anomalous continuous symmetries and quantum topology of Goldstone modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider systems in which a continuous symmetry $G$, which may be anomalous, is spontaneously broken to an anomaly-free subgroup $H$ such that the effective action for the Goldstone modes contains topologically non-trivial terms. If the original system has trivial $G$ anomaly, it is known that the possible topological terms are fully determined by SPT or SET invariants of the residual $H$ symmetry. Here we address the more general setting in which the $G$ symmetry has an anomaly. We argue that in general, the appropriate concept to consider is the "compatibility relation" between the Goldstone invariants and the $G$ anomaly. In the case where the Goldstone modes can be gapped out to obtain invertible families (i.e. without any topological order), we give an explicit mathematical scheme to construct the desired compatibility relation. We also address the case where gapping out the Goldstone modes leads to a family of topologically ordered states. We discuss several examples including the canonical Thouless pump, the quantum Hall ferromagnet, pumps arising from breaking $\text{U}(1)$ symmetry at the boundary of topological insulators in two and three dimensions, and pumps classified by the higher Chern number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1606.06514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that spin valves under suitable symmetry conditions exhibit an ON-OFF response to a spin battery, and are therefore perfect spin transistors. While a spin valve driven by a charge battery displays the usual GMR (Giant Magneto-Resistance), this means that a pure spin current or pure spin accumulation can generate an infinite magnetoresistance (IMR). Magnetic tunnel junctions as well as CPP (current perpendicular to plane) or CIP (current in plane) metallic trilayers are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the speed limits for the propagation of magnons is of key importance for the development of ultrafast spintronics and magnonics. Recently, it was predicted that in 2D antiferromagnets, spin correlations can propagate faster than the highest magnon velocity. Here we gain deeper understanding of this supermagnonic effect based on time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory. We find that the supermagnonic effect is determined by the competition between propagating magnons and a localized quasi-bound state, which is tunable by lattice coordination and quantum spin value $S$, suggesting a new scenario to enhance magnon propagation.</description>

      <title>Isotropic atomic layer etching of MgO-doped lithium niobate using sequential exposures of H$_2$ and SF$_6$ plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a ferroelectric crystal of interest for integrated photonics owing to its large second-order optical nonlinearity and the ability to impart periodic poling via an external electric field. However, on-chip device performance based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by propagation losses arising from surface roughness and corrugations. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially smooth these features and thereby increase photonic performance, but no ALE process has been reported for LN. Here, we report an isotropic ALE process for $x$-cut MgO-doped LN using sequential exposures of H$_2$ and SF$_6$/Ar plasmas. We observe an etch rate of $1.59 \pm 0.02$ nm/cycle with a synergy of $96.9$%. We also demonstrate ALE can be achieved with SF$_6$/O$_2$ or Cl$_2$/BCl$_3$ plasma exposures in place of the SF$_6$/Ar plasma step with synergies of $99.5$% and $91.5$% respectively. The process is found to decrease the sidewall surface roughness of TFLN waveguides etched by physical Ar$^+$ milling by 30% without additional wet processing. Our ALE process could be used to smooth sidewall surfaces of TFLN waveguides as a post-processing treatment, thereby increasing the performance of TFLN nanophotonic devices and enabling new integrated photonic device capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooper quartets represent exotic fermion aggregates describing correlated matter at the basis of charge-$4e$ superconductivity and offer a platform for studying four-body interactions, of interest for topologically protected quantum computing, nuclear matter simulations, and more general strongly correlated matter. Focusing on solid-state systems, we show how to quantum design Cooper quartets in a double-dot system coupled to ordinary superconducting leads through the introduction of an attractive interdot interaction. A fundamentally novel, maximally correlated double-dot ground state, in the form of a superposition of vacuum $|0\rangle$ and four-electron state $|4e\rangle$, emerges as a narrow resonance in a many-body quartet correlator that is accompanied by negligible pair correlations and features a rich phenomenology. The system represents an instance of correlated Andreev matter and the results open the way to the exploration of interaction effects in hybrid superconducting devices, and the study of novel correlated states of matter with ingredients available in a quantum solid-state laboratory.</description>

      <title>Performance of graphene Hall effect sensors: role of bias current, disorder and Fermi velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene Hall effect magnetic field sensors hold great promise for the development of ultra-sensitive magnetometers. Their performance is frequently analysed using the two-channel model where electron and hole conductivities are simply added. Unfortunately, this model is unable to capture all the features of the sensor, particularly the bias current dependence of the magnetic field sensitivity. Here we present an advanced model that provides an in-depth understanding of how graphene Hall sensors operate, and demonstrate its ability to quantitatively assess their performance. First, we report the fabrication of sensors with different qualities of graphene, with the best devices achieving magnetic field sensitivities as high as 5000 ohms/T, outperforming the best silicon and narrow-gap semiconductor-based sensors. Then, we examine their performance in detail using the proposed numerical model, which combines Boltzmann formalism, with distinct Fermi levels for electrons and holes, and a new method for the introduction of substrate-induced electron-hole puddles. Importantly, the dependences of magnetic field sensitivity on bias current, disorder, substrate and Hall bar geometry are quantitatively reproduced for the first time. In addition, the model emphasizes that the performance of devices with widths of the order of the charge carrier diffusion length, is significantly affected by the bias current due to the occurrence of large and non-symmetric carrier accumulation and depletion areas near the edges of the Hall bar. The formation of these areas induces a transverse diffusion particle flux capable of counterbalancing the particle flux induced by the Lorentz force when the Hall electric field cancels out in the ambipolar regime. Finally, we discuss how sensor performance can be enhanced by Fermi velocity engineering, paving the way for future ultra-sensitive graphene Hall effect sensors.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka Ferromagnetism in $3 \times 3$ Arrays and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NF) is a long-predicted example of itinerant ferromagnetism (IF) in the Hubbard model that has been studied theoretically for many years. The condition for NF, an infinite on-site Coulomb repulsion and a single hole in a half-filled band, does not arise naturally in materials. NF was only realized recently for the first time in experiments on a $2\times 2$ array of gated quantum dots. Dopant arrays and gated quantum dots in Si allow for engineering controllable systems with complex geometries. This makes quantum dot arrays good candidates to study NF in different geometries through analog quantum simulation. Here we present theoretical simulations done for $3\times 3$ arrays and larger $N\times N$ arrays, and predict the emergence of different forms of ferromagnetism in different geometries. We find NF in perfect $3\times 3$ arrays, and in $N\times N$ arrays for one hole doping of a half-filled band. The ratio of the hopping $t$ to Hubbard on-site repulsion $U$ that defines the onset of NF scales as $1/N^{3.5}$ as $N$ increases, approaching the bulk limit of infinite $U$ for large $N$. Additional simulations are done for geometries made by removing sites from $N\times N$ arrays. Different forms of ferromagnetism are found for different geometries. Loops show ferromagnetism, but only for three electrons. For loops, the critical $t/U$ for the onset of ferromagnetism scales as $N$ as the loop length increases. We show that the different dependences on size for loops and $N\times N$ arrays can be understood by scaling arguments that highlight the different energy contributions to each form of ferromagnetism. Our results show how analog quantum simulation with small arrays can elucidate the role of effects including wavefunction connectivity; system geometry, size and symmetry; bulk and edge sites; and kinetic energy in determining quantum magnetism of small systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fano resonance is believed to arise when a direct path interferes with a resonant path. We demonstrate that this is not true for chiral electronic transmission without additional direct paths. To address the Fano effect in chiral electronic transport, we suggest an electronic Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer (MZFI), which combines a quantum dot with an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Backscattering is completely suppressed in chiral electronic transport, yielding perfect Fano profiles that can be fully adjusted by an external magnetic flux in the transmission, linear conductance, and differential spectra. Even the current and shot noise for a symmetric interferometer with two arms of the same length exhibit fully controllable resonances and distinct Fano resonance characteristics. Along with the profiles, all of the transport spectra follow the same evolution pattern in a cycle that is resistant to changes in the device's defining parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices are key components in modern electronics covering broad applications ranging from transistors to logic circuits thanks to the output rectified signal in the direction parallel to the input. In this work, we propose a transverse Cooper-pair rectifier in which a non-reciprocal current is perpendicular to the driving field, when inversion, time reversal, and mirror symmetries are broken simultaneously. The Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism is developed to describe the transverse current-voltage relation in a normal-metal/superconductor tunneling junction, where symmetry constraints are achieved by an effective built-in supercurrent manifesting in an asymmetric and anisotropic Andreev reflection. The asymmetry in the Andreev reflection is induced when inversion and time reversal symmetry are broken by the supercurrent component parallel to the junction while the anisotropy occurs when the mirror symmetry with respect to the normal of the junction interface is broken by the perpendicular supercurrent component to the junction. Compared to the conventional longitudinal one, the transverse rectifier supports fully polarized diode efficiency and colossal nonreciprocal conductance rectification, completely decoupling the path of the input excitation from the output rectified signal. This work provides a formalism for realizing transverse non-reciprocity in superconducting junctions, which is expected to be achieved by modifying current experimental setups and may pave the way for future low-dissipation superconducting electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement harvesting between two identical buckled honeycomb lattices placed inside a planar microcavity. By applying time dependent perturbation theory, we obtain quantum correlations between both layers induced by the cavity field. Considering the vacuum state as the initial state of the cavity field and tracing out the time-evolved degrees of freedom, we analyze the entanglement formation using the concurrence measure. We show that the concurrence depends on the virtual photon exchanged and the positions of the layer through the interlayer photon propagator. Furthermore, we find that the formation of entanglement between equal energy electrons tends to be enhanced when they move in perpendicular directions. Our results indicate that a buckled honeycomb structure and a large spin-orbit interaction favor the entanglement harvesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new style of fluxonium qubit, gatemonium, based on an all superconductorsemiconductor hybrid platform. The linear inductance is achieved using six hundred planar Al-InAs Josephson junctions (JJs) in series. By tuning the single junction with a gate voltage, we demonstrate electrostatic control of the effective Josephson energy, tuning the weight of the fictitious phase particle. One and two-tone spectroscopy of the gatemonium transitions further reveal details of the hybrid plasmon-fluxon spectrum. Accounting for the nonsinusoidal current-phase relation of the single junction, we fit the measured spectra to extract charging and inductive energies. We conduct time domain characterization of the plasmon modes in a second gatemonium device with different charging energy and JJ array inductance. We discuss future directions for this platform in gate voltage-tunable, high plasma frequency, enhanced impedance junction arrays, and enhanced coherence times for voltage tunable architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a circuit QED architecture, we investigate the photon emission of a Cooper pair splitter composed of two double quantum dots, each coupled to a microwave transmission line. We demonstrate the capability to generate frequency-entangled photon pairs in the left and right transmission lines, specifically a superposition of two photon wavepackets at different frequencies. The frequency entanglement of the two photons arises from the particle-hole coherent superposition (i.e. Andreev bound states) involving the delocalized entangled spin singlet. We also estimate a lower bound for the efficiency of entangled photon-pair generation, accounting for the presence of non-radiative processes such as phonon emissions. Our proposal is realistic and achievable with state-of-the-art techniques in quantum microwave engineering with quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been renewed interest in studies of criticality in the spin quantum Hall effect, realized in the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry class C of disordered, noninteracting fermions in two spatial dimensions. In our study, we develop a nonperturbative analysis of the replica two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model in class C. We explicitly construct the instanton solution with a unit topological charge. By treating fluctuations around the instanton at the Gaussian level, we calculate the instanton correction to the disorder-averaged logarithm of the partition function. We compute non-perturbative corrections to the anomalous dimensions of pure power-law scaling local operators, which determine the spectrum of generalized multifractality. We also calculate instanton corrections to the renormalized longitudinal and Hall spin conductivities and determine the topology of the phase diagram for class C. Our results demonstrate that the spin quantum Hall effect is indeed a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall effect.</description>

Abstract: The imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor is the Berry curvature, while the real part is the quantum metric. Dirac fermions derived from a tight-binding model naturally contains a mass term $m(k)$ with parabolic dispersion, $m(k)=$ $m+uk^{2}$. However, in the Chern insulator based on Dirac fermions, only the sign of the mass $m$ is relevant. Recently, it was reported that the quantum metric is observable by means of the optical conductivity, which is significantly affected by the parabolic coefficient $% u $. We analytically obtain the quantum metric and the optical conductivity in the Dirac Hamiltonian in arbitrary dimensions, where the Dirac mass has parabolic dispersion. The optical conductivity at the band-edge frequency significantly depends on the dimensions. We also make an analytical study on the quantum metric and the optical conductivity in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and the Haldane model. The optical conductivity is found to be quite different between the topological and trivial phases even when the gap is taken identical.</description>

      <title>Chiral edge mode for single-cone Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the appearance of a chiral edge mode on the two-dimensional (2D) surface of a 3D topological insulator (TI). The edge mode appears along the 1D boundary with a magnetic insulator (MI), dependent on the angle $\theta$ which the magnetization $M$ makes with the normal to surface and on the chemical potential mismatch $\delta\mu$ across the TI--MI interface (assuming $1&gt;\delta\mu/M\equiv\sin\phi)$. The propagation along the interface is chiral, with velocity $v\cos(\theta-\phi)$ smaller than the Dirac fermion velocity $v$. In momentum space the edge mode is an arc state, extending over the finite momentum interval that connects the Dirac point of the gapless Dirac fermions with the magnetic band gap. An electric field parallel to the boundary pumps charge between TI and MI via this arc state.</description>

      <title>Magnetoconductivity of Dirac semimetals and chiral magnetic effect from Keldysh technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of a hypothesis and is based on sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed analytical solution for the equations of motion of the one-body Green function of the double quantum dot is extended to the out-of-equilibrium situation. By solving a linear system for the density correlators, not only the local occupations but also charge and heat currents as well as transport coefficients and the figure of merit are analytically derived in terms of system parameters and external driving forces. The emerging regions of stable occupation and finite currents are explained in terms of addition and removal energies, corresponding to the poles of the Green function. The analytical results are validated against the hierarchical equations of motion method, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Infinite magneto-resistance and bipolar effect in spin valves driven by spin batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that spin valves under suitable symmetry conditions exhibit an ON-OFF response to a spin battery. While a spin valve driven by a charge battery displays the usual GMR (Giant Magneto-Resistance), a pure spin current or pure spin accumulation can generate an infinite magneto-resistance effect(IMR). In practice the effect is curtailed by asymmetry but the achievable magneto-resistance ratio is still predicted to be unusually large in several example setups. It is closely related to the bipolar effect (BE) of Johnson transistor which can be triggered under the same symmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>Revealing non-Markovian Kondo transport with waiting time distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non-Markovian transport dynamics and signatures of the Kondo effect in a single impurity Anderson model. The model consists of a quantum dot (QD) with ultra-strong coupling to a left lead and weak coupling to a right lead acting as a detector. We calculate the waiting time distribution (WTD) of electrons tunneling into the detector using a combination of the hierarchical equations of motion approach (HEOM) and a dressed master equation. Oscillations emerge in the short-time WTD, becoming more pronounced with stronger left-lead coupling. Fourier analysis reveals a blue shift in the oscillation frequency as coupling increases, indicating enhanced system-bath hybridization. Crucially, comparison with a dressed master equation confirms that these oscillations are a direct consequence of non-Markovian system-bath correlations. We examine the Kondo effect's influence on these oscillations by varying the quantum dot's Coulomb repulsion. Increasing this interaction enhances the WTD oscillations, coinciding with the signatures of a strengthened Kondo resonance in the quantum dot's density of states. Our results demonstrate that WTD oscillations offer a valuable tool for probing non-Markovian system-bath interactions and the emergence of Kondo correlations within quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Spin Initialisation and Readout with a Cavity-Coupled Quantum Dot in an In-Plane Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin of a charged semiconductor quantum dot (QD) coupled to an optical cavity is a promising candidate for high fidelity spin-photon interfaces; the cavity selectively modifies the decay rates of optical transitions such that spin initialisation, manipulation, and readout are all possible in a single magnetic field geometry. By performing cavity QED calculations, we show that a cavity with a single, linearly-polarised mode can simultaneously support both high-fidelity optical spin initialisation and readout in a single, in-plane (Voigt geometry) magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that single mode cavities always outperform bi-modal cavities in experimentally favourable driving regimes. Our analysis, when combined with established methods of control in a Voigt geometry field, provides optimal parameter regimes for high-fidelity initialisation and readout, and coherent control in both cavity configurations, providing insights for the design and development of QD spin-photon interfaces as the basis of quantum network nodes and for the generation of photonic graph states.</description>

      <title>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states boost odd-frequency superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict that the occurence of zero energy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov(YSR) bound states in two different setups, metal-spin flipper-metal-s-wave superconductor ($N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) and superconductor-metal-spin flipper-metal-superconductor ($S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) junctions, can generate multi-fold enhancement of surface-induced odd-frequency superconductivity. On the other hand, in the absence of these bound states, even-frequency superconductivity dominates. Specifically, in a $S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$ Josephson junction, the emergence of zero energy YSR bound states leads to a $0-\pi$ junction transition and surface odd-frequency superconductivity dominance. Notably, odd-frequency superconductivity vanishes in the absence of YSR-bound states. Interestingly, the equal spin-triplet pairing is the dominant component in the surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity in both setups, which could have important implications for superconducting spintronics. Overall, our findings may help to detect the presence of YSR-bound states through the observation of surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity and contribute to a better understanding of their relationship.</description>

      <title>Gate control of superconducting current: Mechanisms, parameters and technological potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13734v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, the logic state of a device is set by a gate voltage (VG). The superconducting equivalent of such effect had remained unknown until it was recently shown that a VG can tune the superconducting current (supercurrent) flowing through a nanoconstriction in a superconductor. This gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) effect can lead to superconducting logics like CMOS logics, but with lower energy dissipation. The physical mechanism underlying the GCS effect, however, remains under debate. In this review article, we illustrate the main mechanisms proposed for the GCS effect, and the material and device parameters that mostly affect it based on the evidence reported. We will come to the conclusion that different mechanisms are at play in the different studies reported so far. We then outline studies that can help answer open questions on the effect and achieve control over it, which is key for applications. We finally give insights into the impact that the GCS effect can have towards high-performance computing with low-energy dissipation and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic instability and spin-glass order beyond the Anderson-Mott transition in interacting power-law random banded matrix fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of quenched disorder, the interplay between local magnetic-moment formation and Anderson localization for electrons at a zero-temperature, metal-insulator transition (MIT) remains a long unresolved problem. Here, we study the emergence of these phenomena in a power-law random banded matrix model of spin-1/2 fermions with repulsive Hubbard interactions. Focusing on the regime of weak interactions, we perform both analytical field theory and numerical self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations. We show that interference-mediated effects strongly enhance the density of states and magnetic fluctuations upon approaching the MIT from the metallic side. These are consistent with results due to Finkel'stein obtained four decades ago. Our numerics further show that local moments nucleate from typical states as we cross the MIT, with a density that grows continuously into the insulating phase. We identify spin-glass order in the insulator by computing the overlap distribution between converged Hartree-Fock mean-field moment profiles. Our results indicate that itinerant interference effects can morph smoothly into moment formation and magnetic frustration within a single model, revealing a common origin for these disparate phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of an emergent quasi-localized phase in chiral symmetry classes, where wave function along a spatial direction with weak topology is delocalized but exponentially localized along the other directions. The Anderson transition in 2D chiral symmetry classes is induced by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs of a U(1) phase degree of freedom, while the weak topology endows the pair with the Berry phase. We argue that the Berry phase induces spatial polarizations of the pairs along the topological direction through the quantum interference effect, and the proliferation of the polarized vortex pairs results in the quasi-localized phase.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent resonant phenomena in all-dielectric scatterers: inversion of magnetic inductance and electric displacement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical description and experimental verification of resonant phenomena in electromagnetic fields generated in the near zone of all-dielectric rectangular thin sub wavelength frames, subjected to an incident microwave, is considered. The geometry of considered problems is presented by means of arrangements of these frames in three orthogonal planes, normal respectively to electric component, magnetic component and wave vector of the incident wave. Such trio paves the way to design of 3D all-dielectric multiresonant microwave unit cell. Displacement currents, generated by linearly polarized electromagnetic waves in the system, lead to the formation of magnetic and electric dipoles, each of which possess own resonant frequency. Resonant inversion of magnetic inductance and electric displacement is observed. The sliding incidence of plane wave on the frame is shown to provide the sharp and deep resonance in the components of generated field. The phase shift equal to $\pi$ between the magnetic components of incident and generated wave indicates the formation of negative magnetic response. There observes the angular anisotropy of arising dipoles, manifested in values of resonance frequencies and in the dependence of depths of resonant spectral dips upon the orientation of dipoles, with respect to the direction of propagation of incident wave.</description>

      <title>Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of physics, a pivotal moment occurred six decades ago when Brian Josephson made a groundbreaking prediction, setting in motion a series of events that would eventually earn him the prestigious Nobel Prize eleven years later. This prediction centered around what is now known as the Josephson effect, a phenomenon with far-reaching implications. At the heart of this effect lies the Josephson junction (JJ), a device that has become a linchpin in various scientific applications. This chapter delves into the foundational principles of the Josephson effect and the remarkable properties of JJs. From their role in metrology to their application in radiation detectors, these junctions have ushered in a new era of electronics. Exploiting the unique features of superconductive devices, such as high speed, low dissipation, and dispersion, JJs find today practical implementation in the development of superconductive qubits and nanotechnology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-singlet $s$-wave multi-band superconductors have a topological phase protected by rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry without spin-orbit coupling in two and three dimensions. This topological phase, an example of a representation-protected topological phase, has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index and is stable as long as the bands at the Fermi energy are formed by a doublet of orbital states with finite angular momenta. In the limit of weak superconducting pair potential, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index gives a Fermi-surface formula and is related to the winding number of three-dimensional strong topological superconductors of class CI. We present a model of a topological $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductor that has gapless surface states with a quadratic dispersion and suggest a connection with iron-based superconductors.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit for "ferroelectric metal" which combines seemingly incompatible spontaneous electric polarization and metallicity, has been assiduously ongoing but remains elusive. Unlike traditional ferroelectrics with a wide band gap, ferroelectric (FE) metals can naturally incorporate nontrivial band topology near the Fermi level, endowing them with additional exotic properties. Here, we show first-principles evidence that the metallic PtBi2 monolayer is an intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) topological FE metal, characterized by out-of-plane polarization and a moderate switching barrier. Moreover, it exhibits a topologically nontrivial electronic structure with Z2 invariant equal to 1, leading to a significant FE bulk photovoltaic effect. A slight strain can further enhance this effect to a remarkable level, which far surpass that of previously reported 2D/3D FE materials. Our work provides an important step towards realizing intrinsic monolayer topological FE metals and paves a promising way for future nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>Moire exciton polaritons in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature</title>

Abstract: Moire lattices attract intensive attention in the double graphene/TMD layers and photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics within these structures. However, precise measurement of the moir'e ground states, excited states and Bloch bands in the twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report the strong coupling between the excitons of CsPbBr3 microplates and the photonic modes of the moire lattice at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states trapped in the potential sites and moire polariton bands across the twisted photonic lattice. In addition, the phase locking of moire zero (stable in-phase) states and moire pi (metastable antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. Moir'e polariton distribution can be tuned in the shape of parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another one fixed. Our work lays the foundation to study moir'e exciton polariton Wigner crystals and Luttinger liquid in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.</description>
