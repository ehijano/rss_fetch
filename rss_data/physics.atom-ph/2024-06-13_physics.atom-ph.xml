      <title>An Atomic Beam of Titanium for Ultracold Atom Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generate an atomic beam of titanium (Ti) using a "Ti-ball" Ti-sublimation pump, which is a common getter pump used in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems. We show that the sublimated atomic beam can be optically pumped into the metastable $3d^{3}(^4F){4}s$ $a^5F_5$ state, which is the lower energy level in a nearly cycling optical transition that can be used for laser cooling. We measure the atomic density and transverse and longitudinal velocity distributions of the beam through laser fluorescence spectroscopy. We find a metastable atomic flux density of $4.3(2)\times10^9\,$s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ with mean forward velocity $773(8)\,$m/s at $2.55\,$cm directly downstream of the center of the Ti-ball. Owing to the details of optical pumping, the beam is highly collimated along the transverse axis parallel to the optical pumping beam and the flux density falls off as $1/r$. We discuss how this source can be used to load atoms into a magneto-optical trap.</description>

      <title>Collinear three-photon excitation of a strongly forbidden optical clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ${}^1\!S_0-{}^3\!P_0$ clock transition in strontium serves as the foundation for the world's best atomic clocks and for gravitational wave detector concepts in clock atom interferometry. This transition is weakly allowed in the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr, but strongly forbidden in bosonic isotopes unless a strong external magnetic field is applied. Here we demonstrate coherent excitation of the clock transition in bosonic ${}^{88}$Sr using a novel collinear three-photon process in a weak magnetic field. We observe Rabi oscillations with frequencies of up to $50~\text{kHz}$ using $\text{W}/\text{cm}^{2}$ laser intensities and Gauss-level magnetic field amplitudes. The absence of nuclear spin in bosonic isotopes offers decreased sensitivity to magnetic fields and optical lattice light shifts, enabling clocks with reduced systematic errors. The collinear propagation of the laser fields permits the interrogation of spatially separated atomic ensembles with common laser pulses, a key requirement for dark matter searches and gravitational wave detection with clock atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Branching Ratios for Laser-Cooling of Nonlinear Strontium-Containing Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational branching ratios from the lowest excited electronic state for $\textrm{SrOCH}_3$, $\textrm{SrNH}_2$, and $\textrm{SrSH}$ are measured at the $&lt; 0.1\%$ level. Spectra are obtained by driving the $\tilde{X} - \tilde{A}$ transitions and dispersing the fluorescence on a grating spectrometer. We also perform $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations for the energies of vibrational levels relevant for laser cooling, as well as branching ratios to support the interpretations of all molecular spectra. Symmetry group analysis is applied in conjunction with our data to study rotational closure in these molecules. These analyses indicate favorable prospects for laser cooling $\textrm{SrNH}_2$ and other similar alkaline-earth(-like) amides for future beyond the Standard Model physics searches using polyatomic molecules with long-lived parity doublets.</description>

      <title>Chip-scale sub-Doppler atomic spectroscopy enabled by a metasurface integrated photonic emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate chip-scale sub-Doppler spectroscopy in an integrated and fiber-coupled photonic-metasurface device. The device is a stack of three planar components: a photonic mode expanding grating emitter circuit with a monolithically integrated tilt compensating dielectric metasurface, a microfabricated atomic vapor cell and a mirror. The metasurface photonic circuit efficiently emits a 130 micrometer-wide $1/e^2$ diameter) collimated surface-normal beam with only -6.3 dB loss and couples the reflected beam back into the connecting fiber, requiring no alignment between the stacked components. We develop a simple model based on light propagation through the photonic device to interpret the atomic spectroscopy signals and explain spectral features covering the full Rb hyperfine state manifold.</description>

      <title>Light-induced fictitious magnetic fields for quantum storage in cold atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have demonstrated that optically generated fictitious magnetic fields can be utilized to extend the lifetime of quantum memories in cold atomic ensembles. All the degrees of freedom of an AC Stark shift such as polarization, spatial profile, and temporal waveform can be readily controlled in a precise manner. Temporal fluctuations over several experimental cycles, and spatial inhomogeneities along a cold atomic gas have been compensated by an optical beam. The advantage of the use of fictitious magnetic fields for quantum storage stems from the speed and spatial precision that these fields can be synthesized. Our simple and versatile technique can find widespread application in coherent pulse and single-photon storage in any atomic species.</description>

      <title>Towards a sub-kelvin cryogenic Fabry-Perot silicon cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a sub-kelvin, single-crystal silicon Fabry-Perot cavity. Operating such a cavity below 1~K should reduce the thermal noise limit of the cavity, and by this way address the current limitations of ultrastable lasers. To further decrease mechanical losses, mirrors with silicon substrates and crystalline coatings are optically contacted to the spacer, resulting in a room-temperature finesse of 220,000. To operate our cavity at sub-kelvin temperatures, we use a dilution refrigerator able to reach temperatures down to 10 mK. We have designed a mechanical mount to house our cavity in such a cryostat, with optimized heat transfer that will decrease the cooldown time for temperatures below 1~K. The estimated thermal noise is projected to be $\sim 7{\times}10^{-19}$ at 100~mK. However, silicon cavities with crystalline mirror coatings at cryogenic temperatures have shown birefringence correlated frequency fluctuations as well as unknown additional noise mechanisms \cite{yu2023, kedar2023}. We have measured a room-temperature TEM$_{00}$ birefringent mode splitting of about 250 kHz. Understanding and measuring these noise mechanisms will be a key to attaining fractional frequency stabilities beyond state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive single-ion electrometry in a magnetic field gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperfine energy levels in trapped ions offer long-lived spin states. In addition, the motion of these charged particles couples strongly to external electric field perturbations. These characteristics make trapped ions attractive platforms for the quantum sensing of electric fields. However, the spin states do not exhibit a strong intrinsic coupling to electric fields. This limits the achievable sensitivities. Here, we amplify the coupling between electric field perturbations and the spin states by using a static magnetic field gradient. Displacements of the trapped ion resulting from the forces experienced by an applied external electric field perturbation are thereby mapped to an instantaneous change in the energy level splitting of the internal spin states. This gradient mediated coupling of the electric field to the spin enables the use of a range of well-established magnetometry protocols for electrometry. Using our quantum sensor, we demonstrate AC sensitivities of $\mathrm{S^{AC}_{min}=960(10)\times 10^{-6}~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ at a signal frequency of $\omega_{\epsilon}/2\pi=5.82~\mathrm{Hz}$, and DC sensitivities of $\mathrm{S^{DC}_{min}=1.97(3)\times 10^{-3} ~V m^{-1}Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ with a Hahn-echo type sensing sequence. We also employ a rotating frame relaxometry technique, with which our quantum sensor can be utilised as an electric field noise spectrum analyser. We measure electric field signals down to a noise floor of $\mathrm{S_{E}(\omega)=6.2(5)\times 10^{-12}~V^2 m^{-2}Hz^{-1}}$ at a frequency of $\mathrm{30.0(3)~kHz}$. We therefore demonstrate unprecedented electric field sensitivities for the measurement of both DC signals and AC signals across a frequency range of sub-Hz to $\sim\mathrm{500~kHz}$. Finally, we describe a set of hardware modifications that are capable of achieving a further improvement in sensitivity by up to six orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Coherence limits in lattice atom interferometry at the one-minute scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum metrology and quantum simulation, a coherent non-classical state must be manipulated before unwanted interactions with the environment lead to decoherence. In atom interferometry, the non-classical state is a spatial superposition, where each atom coexists in multiple locations as a collection of phase-coherent partial wavepackets. These states enable precise measurements in fundamental physics and inertial sensing. However, atom interferometers usually use atomic fountains, where the available interrogation time is limited to around 3 seconds for a 10 m fountain. Here, we realise an atom interferometer with a spatial superposition state that is maintained for as long as 70 seconds. We analyse the theoretical and experimental limits to coherence arising from collective dephasing of the atomic ensemble. This reveals that the decoherence rate slows down markedly at hold times that exceed tens of seconds. These gains in coherence may enable gravimetry measurements, searches for fifth forces or fundamental probes into the non-classical nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>High-purity single-photon generation based on cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for generating a high-purity single photon on the basis of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme employs a four-level system including two excited states, two ground states, and two driving lasers; this structure allows the suppression of the re-excitation process due to the atomic decay, which is known to significantly degrade the single-photon purity in state-of-the-art photon sources using a three-level system. Our analysis shows that the re-excitation probability arbitrarily approaches zero without sacrificing the photon generation probability when increasing the power of the driving laser between the excited states. This advantage is achievable by using current cavity-QED technologies. Our scheme can contribute to developing distributed quantum computation or quantum communication with high accuracy.</description>
