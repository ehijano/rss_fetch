      <title>Internal color contributions to flux tube entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work arXiv:2410.00112, we introduced and computed entanglement entropy of the color flux tube (FTE$^2$) between a heavy quark-antiquark pair in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory. Our numerical results suggest that FTE$^2$ can be partitioned into a component corresponding to transverse vibrations of the flux tube and an internal color entropy. Further, motivated by analytical (1+1)D calculations, and SU(2) (2+1)D Yang-Mills numerical results, we argued that the internal entropy takes the form $\langle F\rangle\log(N_c)$, with $\langle F\rangle$ the number of times, on average, that the flux tube crossed a boundary between region $V$ and its complement. We extend here our FTE$^2$ study to consider different geometries of region $V$, varying the number of boundary crossings, and number of colors. Our preliminary results support the conjectured form of the internal entropy, albeit with noteworthy subtleties relating to the partial/full intersections of the flux tube with the region $V$.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{O}(a)$ improvement of the flavour singlet scalar density in a setup with Wilson fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our Ward identity determination of the $\mathrm{O}(a)$ improvement coefficient for the flavour singlet scalar density, namely $g_\mathrm{S}$, from three-flavour lattice QCD with Wilson-clover fermions and the tree-level Symanzik improved gauge action. We employ five couplings, $g_0^2 \in [1.5,1.77]$, that cover the range used in large-volume CLS simulations. While $g_\mathrm{S}$ itself is for instance relevant for the $\mathrm{O}(a)$ improvement of meson and baryon sigma terms, a relation to $b_\mathrm{g}$, the $\mathrm{O}(a)$ improvement parameter of the gauge coupling, can also be established, allowing for its non-perturbative extraction as well. With Wilson fermions, $b_\mathrm{g}$ is in principle required for full $\mathrm{O}(a)$ improvement at non-vanishing sea quark masses. We outline our procedure for extracting $b_\mathrm{g}$.</description>

      <title>Novel first-order phase transition and critical points on $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory in $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ with anisotropic spatial volumes in Euclidean spacetime in lattice numerical simulations and an effective model. In lattice simulations, the energy-momentum tensor defined through the gradient flow is used for the analysis of the stress tensor on the lattice. It is found that a clear pressure anisotropy is observed only at a significantly shorter spatial extent compared with the free scalar theory. We then study the thermodynamics obtained on the lattice in an effective model that incorporates two Polyakov loops along two compactified directions as dynamical variables. The model is constructed to reproduce thermodynamics measured on the lattice. The model analysis indicates the existence of a novel first-order phase transition and critical points as its endpoints. We argue that the interplay of the Polyakov loops induces the first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for a CP broken deconfined phase at $\theta =\pi$ in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory through simulations at imaginary $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills at $\theta=\pi$, which has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we provide a numerical evidence that the CP symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken at low temperature and it gets restored above the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, which is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the situation predicted in the large-$N$ limit. We avoid the severe sign problem by performing simulations at imaginary $\theta$. We obtain the critical temperature of the CP restoration and that of deconfinement at $\theta=\pi$ by analytic continuation, which leads to the above conclusion.</description>

      <title>Fractional instantons and Confinement: first results on a $T_2\times R^2$ roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results obtained for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a four dimensional torus with two directions much smaller than the other two. The small 2-torus is equipped with twisted boundary conditions. This construction provides a way to interpolate from a region in which semiclassical methods can be applied (for small 2-torus size) to the standard infinite volume case. Our simulations at small torus sizes show how the topological charge and the string tension result from a gas of vortex-like fractional instantons. As the size becomes larger the density increases and the separation of structures tends to a constant in agreement with the fractional instanton liquid model picture of the Yang-Mills vacuum.</description>

      <title>Investigation of full heavy $ QQQQ'\bar{Q}$ pentaquark candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in research and experimentation have led to the identification of numerous exotic states in particle physics. Each new discovery not only sparks excitement for future findings but also fuels interest in uncovering additional unknown states. Motivated by this perspective and the recent identification of both standard and exotic hadrons with an increasing number of heavy quarks, this study conducts a spectroscopic analysis of possible pentaquark candidates with spin-parity $\frac{1}{2}^-$, and quark content of $cccb\bar{c}$ and $bbbc\bar{b}$. The masses of these states are calculated by considering the relevant Lorentz structures, including $\slashed{p}$ and $\mathbbm{1}$, yielding the following results, respectively: for the $P_{(4cb)}$ state, $m_{P_{(4cb)}} = 11388.30 \pm 107.79$~MeV and $m_{P_{(4cb)}} = 11368.30 \pm 112.68$~MeV, and for the $P_{(4bc)}$ state, $m_{P_{(4bc)}} = 20998.30 \pm 121.52$~MeV and $m_{P_{(4bc)}} = 20990.50 \pm 125.87$~MeV. Additionally, the current coupling constants of these states to the vacuum, which are essential for analyzing their potential decay modes, are also provided in this study.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Imaging of Pion using Lattice QCD: Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.</description>

      <title>Error Scaling of Sea Quark Isospin-Breaking Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sea-quark isospin-breaking effects (IBE) are difficult to compute since they require the evaluation of all-to-all propagators. However, the quest for high-precision calculations motivates a detailed study of these contributions. There are strong arguments that the stochastic error associated with these quantities should diverge in the continuum and infinite-volume limit, resulting in a possible bottleneck for the method. In this work, we present the study of the error scaling for these quantities using $N_f=3$ $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions QCD with C-periodic boundary conditions in space, a pion mass $M_{\pi}=400$ MeV, a range of lattice spacings $a=0.05, 0.075, 0.1$ fm, and volumes $L=1.6, 2.4, 3.2$ fm. The analysis of the error as a function of the number of stochastic sources shows that we reach the gauge error for the dominant contributions. The errors do not show the leading order divergence $1/a$ for strong-IBE and $1/a^2$ for electromagnetic IBE, in the considered range of lattice spacings. On the other hand, our data are consistent with the predicted leading divergence $\sqrt{V}$.</description>

      <title>Testing the RG-flow $M(3,10)+\phi_{1,7}\to M(3,8)$ with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I will give a brief overview of the Standard Model theory inputs needed for the precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{us}$ from semileptonic kaon decays, focusing on the long-distance electromagnetic corrections. I will then describe our recent effort to pin down this correction at sub-permille level, which further sharpens the so-called ``Cabibbo angle anomaly'', an interesting observation which may point towards new physics.</description>
