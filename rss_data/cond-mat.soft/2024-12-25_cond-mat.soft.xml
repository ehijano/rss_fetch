      <title>Equatorial deformation of homogeneous spherical fluid vesicles by a rigid ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the deformation of homogeneous spherical fluid vesicles along their equator by a circular rigid ring. We consider deformations preserving the axial and equatorial mirror symmetries of the vesicles. The configurations of the vesicle are determined employing the spontaneous curvature model subject to the constraints imposed by the ring as well as of having constant area or volume. We determine two expressions of the force exerted by the ring, one involving a discontinuity in the derivative of the curvature of the membrane across the ring, and another one in terms of the global quantities of the vesicle. For small enough values of the spontaneous curvature there is only one sequence of configurations either for fixed area or volume. The behavior of constricted vesicles is similar for both constraints, they follow a transition from prolate to dumbbell shapes, which culminates in two quasispherical vesicles connected by a small catenoid-like neck. We analyze the geometry and the force of the small neck employing a perturbative analysis about the catenoid. A stretched vesicle initially adopts an oblate shape for either constraint. If the area is fixed the vesicle increasingly flattens until it attains a disclike shape, which we examine using an asymptotic analysis. If the volume is fixed the poles approach until they touch and the vesicle adopts a discocyte shape. When the spontaneous curvature of the vesicle is close to the mean curvature of the constricted quasi-spherical vesicles, the sequences of configurations of both constraints develop bifurcations, and some of their configurations have the lowest energy.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of an active wheel rolling in circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrated granular matter constitutes a useful system for studying the physics of active matter. Usually, self-propulsion is induced in grains through suitable asymmetry in the particle design. In this paper, we show that a symmetrical mini wheel placed on a vibrating plate self-propels along circular trajectories, showing chiral active dynamics. The chiral activity emerges through a sequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the particle's kinetics. The fact that isotropy, fore-aft, and chiral symmetries are broken spontaneously leads to distinct statistics, which include a temporal evolution involving stochastic resetting, a non-Gaussian velocity distribution with multiple peaks, broad power-law curvature distribution, and a bounded chirality probability, along with a phase transition from passive achiral to active chiral state as a function of vibration amplitude. Our study establishes the vibrated wheel as a three-state chiral active system that can serve as a model experimental system to study the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of chiral active systems and can inspire novel locomotion strategies in robotics.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of curved crease origami: 1DoF mechanisms, distributed actuation by spontaneous curvature, and cross-talk between multiple folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami morphing, obtained with patches of piecewise smooth isometries separated by straight fold lines, is an exquisite art that has already received considerable attention in the mathematics and mechanics literature. Curved fold lines, leading to curved creases and curved pleated structures, introduce the additional complexity of mechanical coupling between the folds. This coupling can be exploited to obtain morphing structures with more robust folding pathways. We discuss one-degree-of-freedom mechanisms and folds actuated by spontaneous curvature (as in the case of hygromorphic multilayered composites), comparing the purely geometric approach to two approaches based on the mechanics of active shells and of active three-dimensional solids. Moreover, we discuss the cooperativity of multiple folds and demonstrate the energetic advantage of synchronous folding over sequential folding.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous generation of angular momentum in chiral active crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional chiral active crystal composed of underdamped chiral active particles. These particles, characterized by intrinsic handedness and persistence, interact via linear forces derived from harmonic potentials. Chirality plays a pivotal role in shaping the system's behavior: it reduces displacement and velocity fluctuations while inducing cross-spatial correlations among different Cartesian components of velocity. These features distinguish chiral crystals from their non-chiral counterparts, leading to the emergence of net angular momentum, as predicted analytically. This angular momentum, driven by the torque generated by the chiral active force, exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the degree of chirality. Additionally, it contributes to the entropy production rate, as revealed through a path-integral analysis. We investigate the dynamic properties of the crystal in both Fourier and real space. Chirality induces a non-dispersive peak in the displacement spectrum, which underlies the generation of angular momentum and oscillations in time-dependent autocorrelation functions or mean-square displacement, all of which are analytically predicted.</description>

      <title>Multifluid simulation of shear-induced migration in pressure-driven suspension flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study simulates shear-induced migration (SIM) in semi-dilute pressure-driven Stokes suspension flows using a multi-fluid (MF) model. Building on analysis from a companion paper (Harvie, 2024), the specific formulation uses volume-averaged phase stresses that are linked to the binary hydrodynamic interaction of spheres and suspension microstructure as represented by an anisotropic, piece-wise constant pair-distribution function (PDF). The form of the PDF is chosen to capture observations regarding the microstructure in sheared suspensions of rough particles, as reported in the literature. Specifically, a hydrodynamic roughness value is used to represent the width of the anisotropic region, and within this region the concentration of particles is higher in the compression zone than expansion zone. By numerically evaluating the hydrodynamic particle interactions and calculating the various shear and normal viscosities, the stress closure is incorporated into Harvie's volume-averaged MF framework, referred to as the MF-roughness model. Using multi-dimensional simulations the roughness and compression zone PDF concentration are then globally optimised to reproduce benchmark solid and velocity distributions reported in the literature for a variety of semi-dilute monodisperse suspension flows occurring within rectangular channels. For comparison, two different versions of the phenomenological stress closure by Morris and Boulay (1999) are additionally proposed as fully tensorial frame-invariant alternatives to the MF-roughness model. Referred to as MF-MB99-A and MF-MB99-B, these models use alternative assumptions for partitioning of the mixture normal stress between the solid and fluid phases. The optimised solid and velocity distributions from all three stress closures are similar and correlate well with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. Moreover, they dominate a system's evolution in deciding the selective outcome or shedding light on the preferred mechanism on how a system explores the energy landscape. It is thus crucial to develop techniques to quantify these metastabilities hence uncovering key details of the energy landscape. Here, we propose a powerful method by leveraging a many-body Arrhenius law that detects the metastabilites in an escape problem, involving interacting particles with excluded volume confined to a complex energy landscape. Observing transport in colloidal systems or translocation of macromolecules through biological pores can be an ideal test bed to verify our results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanocrystal superlattice self-assembly near a metastable liquid binodal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical Approach to Calculating Mechanical Stresses in Inhomogeneous Fluids and Its Applications to Ionic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10597v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This extended article presents a thermomechanical approach for calculating the stress tensor from the thermodynamic potential of inhomogeneous fluids and some applications to ionic fluids. The technique, based on the invariance of the fluid's thermodynamic potential with respect to spatial transformations of translation and rotation, offers an alternative to the general covariant approach developed by two of the authors. We apply this technique to both pure mean-field theories of fluids in general and a theory that includes thermal fluctuations of the order parameter, using the example of ionic fluids. Additionally, we apply the thermomechanical approach to fluid models with vector order parameters, such as liquid dielectrics. For this case, we obtain a general expression for the stress tensor. Furthermore, we discuss specific issues related to the calculation of disjoining pressure in ionic fluids confined in nanoscale slit-like pores with metal or dielectric walls, using the Coulomb gas model. To test the robustness of the proposed approach, we reproduce a number of known results from the statistical theory of inhomogeneous fluids and obtain several new ones.</description>

      <title>Atomistic analysis of nematic phase transition in 4-cyano-4$^{\prime}$-$n$-alkyl biphenyl liquid crystals: Sampling for the first-order phase transition and the free-energy decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted using the generalized replica exchange method (gREM) on the 4-cyano-4$^{\prime}$-$n$-alkylbiphenyl ($n$CB) system with $n=5$, 6, 7, and 8, which exhibits a nematic-isotropic (NI) phase transition. Sampling near the phase transition temperature in systems undergoing first-order phase transitions, such as the NI phase transition, is demanding due to the substantial energy gap between the two phases. To address this, gREM, specifically designed for first-order phase transitions, was utilized to enhance sampling near the NI phase transition temperature. Free-energy calculations based on the energy representation (ER) theory were employed to characterize the NI phase transition. ER evaluates the insertion free energy of $n$CB molecule for both nematic and isotropic phases, revealing a change in the temperature dependence across the NI phase transition. Further decomposition into intermolecular interaction energetic and entropic terms shows quantitatively the balance between these contributions at the NI phase transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Condensate-induced organization of the mass profile and emergent power laws in the Takayasu aggregation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-mass condensates, which coexist with a power-law-decaying distribution in the one-dimensional Takayasu model of mass aggregation with input, were recently found in numerical simulations. Here, we establish the occurrence of condensates by analyzing exact recursions for finite systems and further show that they have a strong effect on the properties of the system. In the steady state of a large but finite system, there is a single condensate, whose random movement through the system leads to a reorganization of the mass profile on a macroscopic scale. A scaling analysis of the mean mass and standard deviation at different distances from the condensate leads to the surprising conclusion that the mass distribution on a macroscopic number of sites around the condensate follows a power-law decay with an exponent 5/3, while farther-away sites show the customary Takayasu exponent 4/3, with a crossover in between. Finally, the exit of condensates from a system with open boundaries has a strong effect on the temporal fluctuations of the total mass in the steady state. Their departure is followed by a buildup of mass and subsequent departures, leading to strong intermittency, established through a divergence of the flatness as the scaled time approaches zero.</description>
