      <title>Transverse instability of electron-acoustic solitons in a relativistic degenerate astrophysical magnetoplasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear theory of small-amplitude electron-acoustic solitons (EASs) in a relativistic astrophysical magnetoplasma consisting of two-temperature electrons: a sparse population of relativistic nondegenerate classical electrons and a group of fully degenerate dense relativistic electrons (main constituent) immersed in a static magnetic field with a neutralizing stationary ion background. By using the multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique with the Lorentz transformation, the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov (mZK) equations are derived to describe the evolution of EASs in two different regimes of relativistic degeneracy: $r_{d0}&lt;50$ and $r_{d0}\gtrsim50$. The characteristics of the plane soliton solutions of ZK and mZK equations and the soliton energy are studied. We show that the solitons moving at an angle $\alpha$ to the external magnetic field can be unstable under transverse long-wavelength perturbations. The growth rates of instabilities are obtained and analyzed with the effects of the relativity parameter $\beta_{\rm{cl}}=k_BT_{\rm{cl}}/m_ec^2$ and the degeneracy parameter $r_{d0}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T_{\rm{cl}}$ is the temperature of classical electrons. Interestingly, the ZK solitons, even if it is stable for the first-order perturbations, can be unstable in the second-order correction. Furthermore, while the first-order growth rates of perturbations for ZK solitons tend to vanish as $\alpha\rightarrow 38^\circ$, that for the mZK soliton goes to zero as $\alpha\rightarrow 90^\circ$. However, depending on the angle $\alpha$, the growth rates are found to be reduced either by increasing the values of $\beta_{\rm{cl}}$ or by decreasing the values of $r_{d0}$. The applications of our results to astrophysical plasmas, such as those in the environments of white dwarfs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coherent nonlinear Thomson scattering of Laguerre-Gauss beams on an electron sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the scattering of a monochromatic helical laser beam, described by a Laguerre-Gauss solution of the Maxwell equations, on an electron sheet, initially at rest in the focal plane of the laser; the interaction is described in the framework of a local plane wave approximation. We calculate the scattered electromagnetic field observed in an arbitrary point at a large distance from the laser focal spot, by adding coherently the contributions of each electron in the electron sheet. Due to the interference effects, the radiation is emitted only into the forward direction, within a narrow cone, and it has a spatial structure that we analyze theoretically and numerically. For circularly polarized incident fields, the structure is also helical, with a helical index which depends on the helical index of the incident radiation and the harmonic order. These structures can be observed experimentally, as each harmonic order is emitted with a different frequency, and within cones of different opening angles. Our findings are in agreement with experimental results in the literature which demonstrate the generation of OAM carrying photons by radiation scattering on electrons.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Pedestal Instabilities for Tokamak Plasmas with Different Ion Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this bachelor's thesis, isotope effects for pedestal instabilities have been studied based on an ASDEX Upgrade H-Mode scenario. This was done using the JOREK code for extended MHD simulations, including the ion diamagnetic drift and the establishment of ExB flows. Simulations with single toroidal harmonics were performed for multiple times during the build-up of the pedestal, to assess the evolution of the linear stability of modes occurring near the edge. When changing the average ion masses from 2.0 to 2.5 and 3.0, the variations were small, and MHD's momentum equation was shown to be the major cause for them. As a second step, simulations with multiple toroidal harmonics were performed to simulate an Edge Localized Mode (ELM) crash, again comparing between the average ion masses of 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0. The resulting variations of heat and particle losses were compared to JET results. The experimental differences between ion masses could not be reproduced. Together with the fact that the simulations' pedestal for an average ion mass of 2.5 and 3.0 was not matched to the experiment, this indicates that other effects, such as small-scale turbulences, must be included - for example, by adapting the simulations' transport coefficients - to explain the experimental differences.</description>

      <title>Structure functions with higher-order stencils as a probe to separate small- and large-scale magnetic fields</title>

Abstract: Magnetic fields are an energetically important component of star-formation galaxies, but it is often difficult to measure their properties from observations. One of the complexities stems from the fact that the magnetic fields, especially in spiral galaxies, have a two-scale nature: a large-scale field, coherent over ${\rm kpc}$ scales and a small-scale, random field with a scale of $\lesssim$ $100~{\rm pc}$. Moreover, it is known that the strength of small- and large-scale fields are comparable and this makes it even harder to find their imprints in radio polarisation observations such as the Faraday rotation measure, ${\rm RM}$, which is the integral over the path length of the product of the thermal electron density and the parallel component of the magnetic field to the line of sight. Here, we propose and demonstrate the use of second-order structure functions of ${\rm RM}$ computed with multiple higher-order stencils as a powerful analysis to separate the small- and large-scale magnetic field components. In particular, we provide new methods and calibrations to compute the scale and the strength of the large-scale magnetic field in the presence of small-scale magnetic fluctuations. We then apply the method to find the scale of large-scale magnetic fields in the nearby galaxies M51 and NGC 6946, using archival data and further discuss the need for computing the ${\rm RM}$ structure functions with higher-order stencils. With multiple modern radio polarisation observatories and eventually the Square Kilometre Array, ${\rm RM}$ observations will significantly improve in quantity and quality, and the higher-order stencil structure function techniques developed here can be used to extract information about multiscale magnetic fields in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Ionic structure, Liquid-liquid phase transitions, X-Ray diffraction, and X-Ray Thomson scattering in shock compressed liquid Silicon in the 100-200 GPa regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cutting-edge experiments have provided $in\,situ$ structure characterization and measurements of the pressure ($P$), density ($\bar{\rho}$) and temperature ($T$) of shock compressed silicon in the 100 GPa range of pressures and up to $\sim$10,000K. We present first-principles calculations in this $P,T,\bar{\rho}$ regime to reveal a plethora of novel liquid-liquid phase transitions (LPTs), making the interpretation of these experiments very challenging. The short-ranged ionic structure of the fluid is preserved under collective adjustments of many distant atoms when subject to compression and heating, with surprisingly little change in electrical and thermal conductivities $\sigma$ and $\kappa$. We match the experimental X-Ray Thompson scattering and X-ray diffraction data theoretically, and provide pressure isotherms, ionization data and compressibilities that support the above picture of liquid silicon as a highly complex LPT-driven ``glassy'' metallic liquid. These novel results are relevant to materials research, studies of planetary interiors, high-energy-density physics, and in laser-fusion studies.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of dynamos from an autonomous generation of chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At high energies, the dynamics of a plasma with charged fermions can be described in terms of chiral magnetohydrodynamics. Using direct numerical simulations, we demonstrate that chiral magnetic waves (CMWs) can produce a chiral asymmetry $\mu_5 = \mu_\mathrm{L} - \mu_\mathrm{R}$ from a spatially fluctuating (inhomogeneous) chemical potential $\mu = \mu_\mathrm{L} + \mu_\mathrm{R}$, where $\mu_\mathrm{L}$ and $\mu_\mathrm{R}$ are the chemical potentials of left- and right-handed electrically charged fermions, respectively. If the frequency of the CMW is less than or comparable to the characteristic growth rate of the chiral dynamo instability, the magnetic field can be amplified on small spatial scales. The growth rate of this small-scale chiral dynamo instability is determined by the spatial maximum value of $\mu_5$ fluctuations. Therefore, the magnetic field amplification occurs during periods when $\mu_5$ reaches temporal maxima during the CMW. If the small-scale chiral dynamo instability leads to a magnetic field strength that exceeds a critical value, which depends on the resistivity and the initial value of $\mu$, magnetically dominated turbulence is produced. Turbulence gives rise to a large-scale dynamo instability, which we find to be caused by the magnetic alpha effect. Our results have consequences for the dynamics of certain high-energy plasmas, such as the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Use of current-potential patches to obtain fundamental improvements to the coils of magnetic fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central issue in the design of tokamaks or stellarators is the coils that produce the external magnetic fields. The freedom that remains unstudied in the design of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied computationally at low cost with high reliability. In particular, the space between toroidal field or modular coils that block access to the plasma chamber could be increased by a large factor. This paper explains how this could be done using the concept of current-potential patches that was developed in Todd Elder's thesis.</description>
