      <title>The topology, geometry, and angular momentum of cold plasma waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that plasma waves possess topologically protected edge modes, indicating the existence of topologically nontrivial structures in the governing equations. Here we give a rigorous study of the underlying topological vector bundle structure of cold unmagnetized plasma waves and show that this topology can be used to uncover a number of new results about these waves. The topological properties of the electromagnetic waves mirror those recently found for photons and other massless particles. We show that there exists an explicit globally smooth polarization basis for electromagnetic plasma waves, which is surprising in light of the hairy ball theorem. The rotational symmetry of the waves gives a natural decomposition into topologically nontrivial $R$ and $L$ circularly polarized electromagnetic waves and the topologically trivial electrostatic Langmuir waves. The existence of topologically nontrivial waves, despite the effective mass introduced by the plasma, is related to the resonance of electrostatic and electromagnetic waves. We show that the eigenstates of the angular momentum operator are the spin-weighted spherical harmonics, giving a novel globally smooth basis for plasma waves. The sparseness of the resultant angular momentum multiplet structure illustrates that the angular momentum does not split into well-defined spin and orbital parts. However, we demonstrate that the angular momentum admits a natural decomposition, induced by the rotational symmetry, into two quasi-angular momentum components, termed helicity quasi-angular momentum and orbital quasi-angular momentum. Although these operators do not generate physical rotations and therefore do not qualify as true angular momentum operators, they are gauge invariant, well-defined, and appear to be experimentally relevant.</description>

      <title>The Vlasov equation cannot fully account for collisionless shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is argued that the Vlasov equation cannot fully account for collisionless shocks since it conserves entropy, while a shock does not. A rigorous mathematical theory of collisionless shocks could require working at the Klimontovich level.</description>

      <title>Reaching extreme fields in laser-electron beam collisions with XUV laser light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-based particle accelerators promise to extend the revolutionary work performed with conventional particle accelerators to studies with smaller footprints, lower costs, and higher energies. Here, we propose a new approach to access an unexplored regime of strong-field quantum electrodynamics by plasma wakefield acceleration of both charged particles and photons. Instead of using increasingly powerful accelerators and lasers, we show that photon acceleration of optical pulses into the extreme ultraviolet allows multi-GeV electrons to reach quantum nonlinearity parameters $\chi_e \gg 10$ with a high probability due to the reduced radiative losses. A significant fraction of photons produced in high-$\chi_e$ regions will propagate to detectors without generating pairs because of the reduction in the quantum rates. The photon spectra obtained may be used to characterize the predicted breakdown of strong-field quantum electrodynamics theory as it enters the fully non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Second quantization of nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system for quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson equations, fundamental in plasma physics and astrophysical applications, are rendered linear, finite-dimensional, and discrete by second quantization. Conditions for correspondence between the pre-quantized and quantized equations are derived, and numerical simulations demonstrating the quantized linear system can capture nonlinear dynamics are presented. Finally, encouraging scaling relations emphasizing the prospect of using quantum computers to efficiently integrate the second quantized Vlasov-Poisson equations as a model for the usual Vlasov-Poisson equations are derived.</description>

      <title>Shaping core dynamos in A-type stars: The role of dipolar fossil fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale magnetic fields of Ap/Bp stars are stable over long timescales and have typically simple dipolar geometries, leading to the idea of a fossil origin. These stars are also expected to have convective cores that can host strong dynamo action. We aim to study the interaction between the magnetic fields generated by the convective core dynamo of the star, and a dipolar fossil field reminiscent of observed magnetic topologies of Ap/Bp stars. We use numerical 3D star-in-a-box simulations of a $2.2M_\odot$ A-type star, where the core encompasses $20\%$ of the stellar radius. As an initial condition, we impose two purely poloidal configurations, both with a surface dipolar strength of 6 kG, and we explore different obliquity angles $\beta$ (the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes), ranging from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. The inclusion of a poloidal field where none of the magnetic field lines are closed inside the star, does not affect the core dynamo in a significant way. Dipolar configurations where all the field lines are closed inside the star can enhance the dynamo, producing a superequipartition quasi-stationary solution, where the magnetic energy is 5 times stronger than the kinetic energy. The enhanced core dynamos have typical magnetic field strengths between 105 and 172 kG, where the strength has an inverse relation with $\beta$. The strong magnetic fields produce an almost rigid rotation in the radiative envelope, and change the differential rotation of the core from solar-like to anti-solar. The only cases where the imposed dipoles are unstable and decay are those with $\beta = 90^\circ$. In the rest of cases, the core dynamos are enhanced and the surface magnetic field survives keeping simple topologies like in the observations.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the hybrid piezo and pyroelectric nanogenerators performance by SiO2 nanowires confinement in poly(vinylidene fluoride)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a novel flexible piezo/pyro-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) that combines a uniform film of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) infiltrated over vertically supported SiO2 nanowires (NWs) to enhance both piezoelectric and pyroelectric energy harvesting capabilities. The synthetic procedure involves a low-temperature multi-step approach, including the soft-template formation of SiO2 NWs on a flexible substrate, followed by the infiltration of a PVDF thin film (TF). The plasma-enabled fabrication of SiO2 NWs facilitated vertical alignment and precise control over the surface microstructure, density, and thickness of the confined nanostructures. These strategic structural systems promote the development of the most favourable electroactive \b{eta}- and {\gamma}-phases in the PVDF matrix. Notably, the electrical poling plays a major role in aligning the random dipoles of the PVDF macromolecular chain in a more ordered fashion to nucleate the amplified electroactive phases. As a proof-of-concept, the fabricated PPNG exhibited a significant improvement in the instantaneous piezoelectric output power density (P), ~ 9-fold amplification relative to its bare PVDF TF counterpart. Analogously, the pyroelectric coefficient (p) demonstrated a 4-fold superior performance with referenced PVDF TF based PPNG. Thus, the engineered system of SiO2 NWs@PVDF comprising PPNG offers a promising pathway toward multisource energy harvesting capabilities through efficient energy transduction at mechanical excitation frequencies of 10-12 Hz and across a temperature difference ({\Delta}T) of 9 to 22 K.</description>

      <title>Ion acceleration from micrometric targets immersed in an intense laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11135v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of proton acceleration by intense laser irradiation of micrometric bar targets, whose dimensions are transversely immersed in the laser focal volume and are longitudinally smaller than half its wavelength. With only 120 mJ of laser energy, we recorded proton energies in excess of 6~MeV, three times higher than those achieved with flat-foil irradiation using similar pulse energies. 3D particle-in-cell simulations revealed that the efficient energy transfer from the diffracted laser fields to electrons on both sides of the target, combined with its reduced surface area, results in a thicker electron sheath and higher acceleration gradients. We demonstrated numerically how this technique opens up the possibility of laser-ion acceleration in a cascaded manner, allowing manipulation of the ion spectrum by optical means.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the ionization of protein crystals by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms (Z &gt; 10) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by rapidly seeding electron ionization cascades. In a typical protein crystal, sulfur atoms and solvated salts induce a substantial fraction of light-atom ionization. In further modeling of various targets, global ionization peaks at photon energies roughly 2 keV above inner-shell absorption edges, as sub-2 keV photoelectrons ejected from these shells initiate ionization cascades that are briefer than the XFEL pulse. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in XFEL experiments.</description>

      <title>Ion-motion simulations of a plasma-wakefield experiment at FLASHForward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In plasma-based acceleration, an ultra-relativistic particle bunch$\unicode{x2014}$or an intense laser beam$\unicode{x2014}$is used to expel electrons from its propagation path, forming a wake that is devoid of electrons. The ions, being significantly more massive, are often assumed to be stationary. However, both theory and simulations suggest that any sufficiently dense electron bunch can trigger ion motion, and its effect must be taken into account. We simulate beam-driven plasma wakefields to identify key features$\unicode{x2014}$such as longitudinally dependent emittance growth$\unicode{x2014}$that could be observed in an experiment using plasma and beam parameters from the FLASHForward facility at DESY.</description>
