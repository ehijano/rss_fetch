      <title>Hankel determinant and orthogonal polynomials arising from the matrix model in 2D quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hankel determinant and orthogonal polynomials with respect to the two-parameter weight function $$ w(x)=w(x;t_1, t_2):=\exp(-x^6-t_2 x^4-t_1 x^2),\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}, $$ with $t_1,\; t_2 \in \mathbb{R}$. This problem arises from the matrix model in 2D quantum gravity investigated by Fokas, Its and Kitaev [Commun. Math. Phys. \textbf{142} (1991) 313--344]. By making use of the ladder operator approach, we find that the recurrence coefficient $\beta_{n}(t_1,t_2)$ for the monic orthogonal polynomials satisfies a nonlinear fourth-order difference equation, which is within the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. We show that the orthogonal polynomials satisfy a second-order linear differential equation whose coefficients are all expressed in terms of $\beta_{n}(t_1,t_2)$. The relations between the logarithmic partial derivative of the Hankel determinant, the nontrivial leading coefficient of the monic orthogonal polynomials, and the recurrence coefficient are established. By using Dyson's Coulomb fluid approach, we obtain the large $n$ asymptotic expansions of the recurrence coefficient $\beta_{n}(t_1,t_2)$, the nontrivial leading coefficient $\mathrm{p}(n,t_1,t_2)$, the normalized constant $h_n(t_1,t_2)$ and the Hankel determinant $D_{n}(t_1,t_2)$.</description>

      <title>$q$-Series Invariants of Three-Manifolds and Knots-Quivers Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa (GPPV) conjecture is a relationship between two three-manifold invariants: the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariant and the \(\widehat{Z}\) (``Z-hat'') invariant. In fact, WRT invariant is defined at roots of unity, $\mathbbm{q}\left(\exp\left(\frac{2\pi i}{k+2}\right),~k\in\mathbb{Z}_+,~\text{for}~SU(2)\right)$, and is generally a complex number, whereas $\widehat{Z}$-invariant is a $q$-series with integer coefficients such that $|q|&lt;1$. Therefore, $\widehat{Z}$-invariant can be obtained from WRT-invariant by performing a particular analytic continuation, $\mathbbm{q}\rightarrow q$. In this thesis, we first examine this conjecture for $SO(3)$ and the ortho-symplectic supergroup $OSp(1|2)$. This is done by setting up the WRT invariant for the respective groups and then performing the particular analytic continuation to extract $\widehat{Z}$. As a result of this exercise, we found that $\widehat{Z}^{SU(2)}=\widehat{Z}^{SO(3)}$ and identified a relation between $\widehat{Z}^{SU(2)}$ and $\widehat{Z}^{OSp(1|2)}$. Motivated by the equality of $\widehat{Z}$ for $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ groups, we study this conjecture for $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_m$ groups, where $\mathbb{Z}_m$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N$, in our second paper. We subsequently found that $\widehat{Z}^{SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_m}=\widehat{Z}^{SU(N)}$.
  Another theme of the thesis is to study a conjecture between knot theory and quiver representation theory. More precisely, this conjecture relates the generating function of the symmetric $r$-colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial with the motivic generating series associated with a symmetric quiver. In particular, we obtain a quiver representation for a family of knots called double twist knots $K(p,-m)$. Primarily, we exploit the reverse engineering of Melvin-Morton-Rozansky (MMR) formalism to deduce the pattern of the matrix for these quivers.</description>

      <title>The Wehrl-type entropy conjecture for symmetric $SU(N)$ coherent states: cases of equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lieb and Solovej proved that, for the symmetric $SU(N)$ representations, the corresponding Wehrl-type entropy is minimized by symmetric coherent states. However, the uniqueness of the minimizers remained an open problem when $N\geq 3$. In this note we complete the proof of the Wehrl entropy conjecture for such representations, by showing that symmetric coherent states are, in fact, the only minimizers. We also provide an application to the maximum concentration of holomorphic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Sachs equations and plane waves III: Microcosms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the structure of plane wave spacetimes (of signature $(1,n+1)$, $n\ge 2$) that are homogeneous (the isometry group is transitive) and geodesically complete -- which we call microcosms. In general, a plane wave is shown to determine a smooth positive curve in the Lagrangian Grassmannian associated with the $2n$ dimensional symplectic vector space of Jacobi fields. We show how to solve the Sachs equations in full generality for microcosms and, moreover, we relate the power series expansions canonical solutions to the Sachs equations on a general plane wave to Bernoulli-like recursions. It is shown that for microcosms, the curve in the Lagrangian Grassmannian associated to a microcosm is an orbit of a one parameter group in $\operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb R)$. We also give an effective method for determining the orbit. Finally, we specialize to the case of $n=2$, and give analytical formulae for the solutions to the Sachs equations and the associated one-parameter group orbit.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Limit of the Low-Density Magnetic Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Lorentz gas proposed by Bobylev et al. [4], which describes a point particle moving in a random distribution of hard-disk obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ under the influence of a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. We show that, in the coupled low-density and diffusion limit, when the intensity of the magnetic field is smaller than $\frac{8\pi}{3}$, the non-Markovian effects induced by the magnetic field become sufficiently weak. Consequently, the particle's probability distribution converges to the solution of the heat equation with a diffusion coefficient dependent on the magnetic field and given by the Green-Kubo formula. This formula is derived from the generator of the generalized Boltzmann process associated with the generalized Boltzmann equation, as predicted in [4].</description>

      <title>Polynomial potentials and nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the partial solution of the energy-eigenvalue problem for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators of the form $H_N=X_0^2+V_N$, where $V_N=X_N^2+\alpha X_{N-1}$ is a polynomial potential of degree $(2N-2)$ and $X_i$ are the generators of an irreducible representation of a particular nilpotent group $\mathcal{G}_N$. Algebraization of the eigenvalue problem is achieved for eigenfunctions of the form $\sum_{k=0}^M a_k X_2^k \exp(-\int dx\, X_N)$. It is shown that the overdetermined linear system of equations for the coefficients $a_k$ has a nontrivial solution, if the parameter $\alpha$ and $(N-3)$ Casimir invariants satisfy certain constraints. This general setting works for even $N\geq 2$ and can also be applied to odd $N\geq 3$, if the potential is symmetrized by considering it as function of $|x|$ rather than $x$. It provides a unified approach to quasi-exactly solvable polynomial interactions, including the harmonic oscillator, and extends corresponding results known from the literature. Explicit expressions for energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are given for the quasi-exactly solvable sextic, octic and decatic potentials. The case of $E=0$ solutions for general $N$ and $M$ is also discussed. As physical application, the movement of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field of pertinent polynomial form is shortly sketched.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics of Arc-Sine and Semi-Circle Distributions: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the program of applying beyond physics the technique of \textbf{probabilistic quantization} and extending to the quantum mechanics associated with the arc--sine distributions our previous results on the semi--circle distribution. We derive analytical expressions for the momentum and kinetic energy operators using the arc--sine weighted Hilbert transform and express corresponding evolutions as Neumann series of Bessel functions. These series are applicable in various physical problems and in solving certain mixed difference equations and differential equations. Moreover, exploiting the similarity between the Jacobi sequences of the semi-circle and arc-sine measures, we establish a unified formulation of their quantum mechanics. We introduce the semicircle and arc--sine exponential vectors and the corresponding coherent states and prove that, for both measures, the vacuum distributions of the number operator in these states (arc--sine photon statistics) are a \textit{perturbation} of the geometric distribution (Gibbs states in Boson physics: see the Introduction below for a discussion of the physical meaning of this perturbation). The $*$--Lie algebra generated by canonical creation and annihilation operators of both probability measures is isomorphic to the $*$--Lie algebra generated by all rank-one operators in corresponding $L^2$-spaces. The paper concludes with appendices that discuss the integral and Neumann series representations of the $1$--parameter unitary groups generated by momentum in semi-circle and arc-sine cases.</description>

      <title>A certified classification of first-order controlled coaxial telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to an intrinsic geometrical classification of three-mirror telescopes. The problem is formulated as the study of connected components of a semi-algebraic set that is real solutions of a set of polynomial equations under polynomial inequalities. Under first order approximation, we give the general expression of the transfer matrix of a general optical system composed by N mirrors. Thanks to this representation, for focal telescopes, we express focal, null Petzval's curvature and telecentricity conditions as polynomials equations depending on the inter-mirror distances and mirror magnifications. Eventually, the set of admissible focal telescopes is written as real solutions of aforementioned polynomial equations under non degenerating conditions that are non-null curvatures and non-null magnifications. The set of admissibile afocal telescopes is written analogously. Then, in order to study the topology of these sets, we address the problem of counting and describe their connected components. To achieve this, we consider the canonical projection on a well-chosen parameter space and we split the semi-algebraic set w.r.t the locus of the critical points of the projection restricted to this set. Then, we show that each part projects homeomorphically for N = 3 and we obtain the connected components of the initial set by merging those of each part through the set of critical points of the introduced projection. Besides, in that case, we give the semi-algebraic description of the connected components of the initial set and introduce a topological invariant and a nomenclature which encodes the invariant topological/optical features of optical configurations lying in the same connected component.</description>

      <title>Unitary $n$-correlations with restricted support in random matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11662v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $n$-correlation of eigenvalues of random unitary matrices in the alternative form that is not the tidy determinant common in random matrix theory, but rather the expression derived from averages of ratios of characteristic polynomials in a method that can be mimicked in number theoretical calculations of the correlations of zeros of $L$-functions. This alternative form for eigenvalues of matrices from $U(N)$ was proposed by Conrey and Snaith and derived by them when the test function has support in (-2,2), derived by Chandee and Lee for support (-4,4) and here we calculate the expression when the support is (-6,6).</description>

      <title>Multi-component Hamiltonian difference operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study local Hamiltonian operators for multi-component evolutionary differential-difference equations. We address two main problems: the first one is the classification of low order operators for the two-component case. On the one hand, this extends the previously known results in the scalar case; on the other hand, our results include the degenerate cases, going beyond the foundational investigation conducted by Dubrovin. The second problem is the study and the computation of the Poisson cohomology for a two-component (-1,1)-order Hamiltonian operator with degenerate leading term appearing in many integrable differential-difference systems, notably the Toda lattice. The study of its Poisson cohomology sheds light on its deformation theory and the structure of the bi-Hamiltonian pairs where it is included in, as we demonstrate in a series of examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two dimensional quantum system with an infinite waveguide of the width $d$ and a transversally invariant profile. Furthermore, we assume that at a distant $\rho$ there is a perturbation defined by the Kato measure. We show that, under certain conditions, the resolvent of the Hamiltonian has the second sheet pole which reproduces the resonance at $z(\rho)$ with the asymptotics $z(\rho)=\mathcal E_{\beta ; n}+\mathcal O \Big(\frac{ \exp(-\sqrt{2 |\mathcal E_{\beta ;n}| } \rho )}{\rho }\Big)$ for $\rho$ large and with the resonant energy $\mathcal E_{\beta ;n}$. Moreover, we show that the imaginary component of $z(\rho)$ satisfies Fermi's golden rule which we explicitly derive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a 3-product space. Let $A: \mathcal{D}(A)\subseteq \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$, $B: \mathcal{D}(B)\subseteq \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$ and $C: \mathcal{D}(C)\subseteq \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$ be possibly unbounded 3-self-adjoint operators. Then for all \begin{align*}
  x \in \mathcal{D}(ABC)\cap\mathcal{D}(ACB) \cap \mathcal{D}(BAC)\cap\mathcal{D}(BCA) \cap \mathcal{D}(CAB)\cap\mathcal{D}(CBA) \end{align*} with $\langle x, x, x \rangle =1$, we show that \begin{align*} (1)\quad \quad \Delta _x(3, A) \Delta _x(3, B) \Delta _x(3, C)\geq |\langle (ABC-a BC-b AC-c AB)x, x, x\rangle +2abc|, \end{align*} where \begin{align*}
  \Delta _x(3, A):= \|Ax-\langle Ax, x, x \rangle x \|, \quad a:= \langle Ax, x, x \rangle, \quad b := \langle Bx, x, x \rangle, \quad c := \langle Cx, x, x \rangle. \end{align*} We call Inequality (1) as 3-Heisenberg-Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty principle. Classical Heisenberg-Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty principle (by Schrodinger in 1930) considers two operators whereas Inequality (1) considers three operators.</description>

      <title>On the negative coupling O(N) model in 2d at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, I consider N-component scalar quantum field theory in two dimensions interacting with an upside-down quartic potential. Working in the large N limit, the model can be solved non-perturbatively using the saddle-point method for sufficiently strong negative coupling. At high temperature, the O(N) model dimensionally reduces to ${\cal PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics, for which powerful non-perturbative solution methods exist. It is found that the solution from quantum mechanics can be matched by the saddle-point method in quantum field theory when allowing for saddles beyond the principal Riemann sheet. I show that saddle points on non-principal Riemann sheets lead to a fully consistent solution of the 2d negative-coupling O(N) model for all temperatures.</description>

      <title>$F$-extremization determines certain large-$N$ CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the conformal data of a range of large-$N$ CFTs, the melonic CFTs, are specified by constrained extremization of the universal part of the sphere free energy $F=-\log Z_{S^d}$, called $\tilde{F}$. This family includes the generalized SYK models, the vector models (O$(N)$, Gross-Neveu, etc.), and the tensor field theories. The known $F$ and $a$-maximization procedures in SCFTs are therefore extended to these non-supersymmetric CFTs in continuous $d$. We establish our result using the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, and, equivalently, by Feynman diagram resummation. $\tilde{F}$ interpolates in continuous dimension between the known $C$-functions, so we interpret this result as an extremization of the number of IR degrees of freedom, in the spirit of the generalized $c,F,a$-theorems. The outcome is a complete classification of the melonic CFTs: they are the conformal mean field theories which extremize the universal part of the sphere free energy, subject to an IR marginality condition on the interaction Lagrangian.</description>

Abstract: We study transitions between the three universal limiting kernels Airy, Pearcey and sine kernel, arising in Random Matrix Theory at edge, cusp and bulk points of the spectrum. Under appropriate rescalings, we provide complete asymptotic expansions of the extended Airy kernel and the extended Pearcey kernel approaching the extended sine kernel, expliciting the fluctuations.</description>

      <title>On holographic duals of certain isolated weighted Gorenstein cDV singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on an important mathematical conjecture, together with hypothesis of homological mirror symmetry in the context of Landau-Ginzburg models, we show that a class of compound Du Val singularities do not admit a crepant resolution. Most of these singularities sit in the type cEn. This implies that those singularities are not dual to four dimensional N =1 superconformal quiver gauge theories through stacks of D3 branes placed at the singularities. We verify this statement on the physics side by enumerating consistent gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement of qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an in-depth study of tripartite entanglement of qudits. We start with a short review of tripartite entanglement invariants, prove a theorem about the complete list of all allowed values of three (out of the total of four) such invariants, and give several bounds on the allowed values of the fourth invariant. After introducing several operations on entangled states (that allow us to build new states from old states) and deriving general properties pertaining to their invariants, we arrive at the decomposition theorem as one of our main results. The theorem relates the algebraic invariants of any entanglement class with the invariants of its corresponding components in each of its direct sum decompositions. This naturally leads to the definition of reducible and irreducible entanglement classes. We explicitly compute algebraic invariants for several families of irreducible classes and show how the decomposition theorem allows computations of invariants for compounded classes to be carried out efficiently. This theorem also allows us to compute the invariants for the infinite number of entanglement classes constructed from irreducible components. We proceed with the complete list of the entanglement classes for three tribits with decompositions of each class into irreducible components, and provide a visual guide to interrelations of these decompositions. We conclude with numerous examples of building classes for higher-spin qudits.</description>

      <title>Soliton solutions associated with the third-order ordinary linear differential operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit solutions to the related integrable nonlinear evolution equations are constructed by solving the inverse scattering problem in the reflectionless case for the third-order differential equation $d^3\psi/dx^3+Q\,d\psi/dx+P\psi=k^3\psi,$ where $P$ and $Q$ are the potentials in the Schwartz class and $k^3$ is the spectral parameter. The input data set used to solve the relevant inverse problem consists of the bound-state poles of a transmission coefficient and the corresponding bound-state dependency constants. Using the time-evolved dependency constants, explicit solutions to the related integrable evolution equations are obtained. In the special cases of the Sawada--Kotera equation, the Kaup--Kupershmidt equation, and the bad Boussinesq equation, the method presented here explains the physical origin of the constants appearing in the relevant $\mathbf N$-soliton solutions algebraically constructed, but without any physical insight, by the bilinear method of Hirota.</description>

      <title>Reflectionless operators and automorphic Herglotz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I am interested in canonical systems and Dirac operators that are reflectionless on an open set. In this situation, the half line $m$ functions are holomorphic continuations of each other and may be combined into a single function. By passing to the universal cover of its domain, we then obtain a one-to-one correspondence of these operators with Herglotz functions that are automorphic with respect to the Fuchsian group of covering transformations. I investigate the properties of this formalism, with particular emphasis given to the measures that are automorphic in a corresponding sense. This will shed light on the reflectionless operators as a topological space, on their extreme points, and on how the heavily studied smaller space of finite gap operators sits inside the (much) larger space.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Holographic Wilson Loop Correlators and Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a well-known phenomenon in the infrared regime of (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory. Although experiments and numerical simulations have solidly confirmed confinement, its physical origin remains mysterious today, and finding a theoretical explanation for it is a long-standing and challenging problem in physics and mathematics. Inspired by the recent progress in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we compute the Wilson loop correlators of the large-$N$ limit of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory holographically in an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane background. The quantum gravity fluctuations of the near-horizon region are considered, which consequently affect the holographic Wilson loop correlators. Within this framework, the results suggest that the confinement of the super-Yang-Mills theory is induced by the near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations of the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bidirectional Transition Dispersion Entropy-based Lempel-Ziv Complexity and Its Application in Fault-Bearing Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) is a key measure for detecting the irregularity and complexity of nonlinear time series and has seen various improvements in recent decades. However, existing LZC-based metrics, such as Permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC) and Dispersion-Entropy based Lempel-Ziv complexity (DELZC), focus mainly on patterns of independent embedding vectors, often overlooking the transition patterns within the time series. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel LZC-based method called Bidirectional Transition Dispersion Entropy-based Lempel-Ziv complexity (BT-DELZC). Leveraging Markov chain theory, this method integrates a bidirectional transition network framework with DELZC to better capture dynamic signal information. Additionally, an improved hierarchical decomposition algorithm is used to extract features from various frequency components of the time series. The proposed BT-DELZC method is first evaluated through four simulated experiments, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in characterizing nonlinear time series. Additionally, two fault-bearing diagnosis experiments are conducted by combining the hierarchical BT-DELZC method with various classifiers from the machine learning domain. The results indicate that BT-DELZC achieves the highest accuracy across both datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods such as LZC, PLZC, and DELZC in extracting features related to fault bearings.</description>

      <title>The focusing complex mKdV equation with nonzero background: Large $N$-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons and related Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the large-order asymptotics of multi-rational solitons of the focusing complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (c-mKdV) equation with nonzero background via the Riemann-Hilbert problems. First, based on the Lax pair, inverse scattering transform, and a series of deformations, we construct a multi-rational soliton of the c-mKdV equation via a solvable Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP). Then, through a scale transformation, we construct a RHP corresponding to the limit function which is a new solution of the c-mKdV equation in the rescaled variables $X,\,T$, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the RHP's solution. Moreover, we also find that the limit function satisfies the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to space $X$ and time $T$, respectively. The ODEs with respect to space $X$ are identified with certain members of the Painlev\'{e}-III hierarchy. We study the large $X$ and transitional asymptotic behaviors of near-field limit solutions, and we provide some part results for the case of large $T$. These results will be useful to understand and apply the large-order rational solitons in the nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Kuramoto-Shivashinsky like equation close to the threshold of instability with additive white noise and spatially periodic boundary conditions which simultaneously exhibit Turing bifurcations with a spatial 1:3 resonance of the critical wave numbers. For the description of the bifurcating solutions we derive a system of coupled stochastic Landau equations. It is the goal of this paper to prove error estimates between the associated approximation obtained through this amplitude system and true solutions of the original system. The Kuramoto-Shivashinsky like equation serves as a prototype model for so-called super-pattern forming systems with quadratic nonlinearity and additive white noise.</description>

      <title>Calculating Spectra by Sequential High-Pass Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11891v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand on the method of sequential filtering for calculating spectra of inhomogeneous fields. Sadek &amp; Aluie [Phys. Rev. Fluids, 3, 124610 (2018)] showed that the kernel has to have at least $p$ vanishing moments to extract a power-law spectrum $k^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;p+2$ by low-pass filtering. Here, we show that sequential high-pass filtering allows for extracting steeper spectra with $\alpha&lt;2p+3$ using the same $p$-th order kernel. For example, any spectrum of a field that is shallower than $k^{-5}$ can be extracted by sequential high-pass filtering using any 1st order kernel such as a Gaussian or top-hat. Finally, we demonstrate how second-order structure functions fail to capture spectral peaks because they cannot detect scaling that is too shallow.</description>

Abstract: We study the propagation of initial condition in the presence of two topological insulators without magnetic field where the interface is a smooth connected not compact curve without boundaries. The solution is governed by an adiabatic modulation of a Dirac operator with a variable mass. We determine the evolution of the semiclassical measure of the solution with a two-scale Wigner measure method by reducing the Dirac operator to a normal form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for free-fermion chains with a particular form of inhomogeneity. The hopping amplitudes and chemical potentials are chosen such that the single-particle eigenstates are related to discrete orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. Due to the bispectral properties of these functions, one can construct an operator which commutes exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian and corresponds to a linear or parabolic deformation of the physical one. We show that this deformation is interpreted as a local inverse temperature and can be obtained in the continuum limit via methods of conformal field theory. Using this prediction, the properly rescaled eigenvalues of the commuting operator are found to provide a very good approximation of the entanglement spectrum and entropy.</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$, which manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

      <title>Secular growths and their relation to equilibrium states in perturbative QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the perturbative treatment of interacting quantum field theories, if the interaction Lagrangian changes adiabatically in a finite interval of time, secular growths may appear in the truncated perturbative series also when the interaction Lagrangian density is returned to be constant. If this happens, the perturbative approach does not furnish reliable results in the evaluation of scattering amplitudes or expectation values. In this paper we show that these effects can be avoided for adiabatically switched-on interactions, if the spatial support of the interaction is compact and if the background state is suitably chosen. We start considering equilibrium background states and show that, when thermalisation occurs (interaction Lagrangian of spatial compact support), secular effects are avoided. Furthermore, no secular effects pop up if the limit where the Lagrangian is supported everywhere in space is taken after thermalisation (large time limit), in contrast to the reversed order. This result is generalized showing that if the interaction Lagrangian is spatially compact, secular growths are avoided for generic background states which are only invariant under time translation and to states whose explicit dependence of time is not too strong. Finally, as an application, the presented theorems are used to study a complex scalar and a Dirac field, on a background KMS state, in a classical external electromagnetic potential and the contribution to the two point-function given by a generic loop diagram arising from a second order perturbative expansion.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of systems with varying number of particles: from Liouville equations to general master equations for open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A varying number of particles is one of the most relevant characteristics of systems of interest in nature and technology, ranging from the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment to the change of particle number through internal dynamics such as reactions. The physico-mathematical modeling of these systems is extremely challenging, with the major difficulty being the time dependence of the number of degrees of freedom and the additional constraint that the increment or reduction of the number and species of particles must not violate basic physical laws. Theoretical models, in such a case, represent the key tool for the design of computational strategies for numerical studies that deliver trustful results. In this manuscript, we review complementary physico-mathematical approaches of varying number of particles inspired by rather different specific numerical goals. As a result of the analysis on the underlying common structure of these models, we propose a unifying master equation for general dynamical systems with varying number of particles. This equation embeds all the previous models and can potentially model a much larger range of complex systems, ranging from molecular to social agent-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Novikov problem for superposition of periodic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Novikov problem, namely, the problem of describing the level lines of quasiperiodic functions on the plane, for a special class of potentials that have important applications in the physics of two-dimensional systems. Potentials of this type are given by a superposition of periodic potentials and represent quasiperiodic functions on a plane with four quasiperiods. Here we study an important special case when the periodic potentials have the same rotational symmetry. In the generic case, their superpositions have ``chaotic'' open level lines, which brings them close to random potentials. At the same time, the Novikov problem has interesting features also for ``magic'' rotation angles, which lead to the emergence of periodic superpositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

Abstract: The von Neumann entropy of a $k$-body reduced density matrix $\gamma_k$ quantifies the entanglement between $k$ quantum particles and the remaining ones. In this short paper, we rigorously prove general properties of this entanglement entropy as a function of $k$: it is concave for all $1\leq k\leq N$ and non-decreasing until the midpoint $k\leq \lfloor N/2\rfloor$. The results hold for indistinguishable quantum particles and are independent of the statistics.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Environment Seen from Geodesics in Exponential Last-Passage Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known question in planar first-passage percolation concerns the convergence of the empirical distribution of weights as seen along geodesics. We demonstrate this convergence for an explicit model, directed last-passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with i.i.d. exponential weights, and provide explicit formulae for the limiting distributions, which depend on the asymptotic direction. For example, for geodesics in the direction of the diagonal, the limiting weight distribution has density $(1/4+x/2+x^2/8)e^{-x}$, and so is a mixture of Gamma($1,1$), Gamma($2,1$) and Gamma($3,1$) distributions with weights $1/4$, $1/2$, and $1/4$ respectively. More generally, we study the local environment as seen from vertices along geodesics (including information about the shape of the path and about the weights on and off the path in a local neighborhood). We consider finite geodesics from $(0,0)$ to $n\boldsymbol{\rho}$ for some vector $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ in the first quadrant, in the limit as $n\to\infty$, as well as semi-infinite geodesics in direction $\boldsymbol{\rho}$. We show almost sure convergence of the empirical distributions of the environments along these geodesics, as well as convergence of the distributions of the environment around a typical point in these geodesics, to the same limiting distribution, for which we give an explicit description.
  We make extensive use of a correspondence with TASEP as seen from an isolated second-class particle for which we prove new results concerning ergodicity and convergence to equilibrium. Our analysis relies on geometric arguments involving estimates for last-passage times, available from the integrable probability literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of deterministic matrices $A = A_N$ and a sequence of deterministic nonnegative matrices $\Sigma=\Sigma_N$ such that $A\to a$ and $\Sigma\to \sigma$ in $\ast$-distribution for some operators $a$ and $\sigma$ in a finite von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Let $U =U_N$ and $V=V_N$ be independent Haar-distributed unitary matrices. We use free probability techniques to prove that, under mild assumptions, the empirical eigenvalue distribution of $U\Sigma V^*+A$ converges to the Brown measure of $T+a$, where $T\in\mathcal{A}$ is an $R$-diagonal operator freely independent from $a$ and $\vert T\vert$ has the same distribution as $\sigma$. The assumptions can be removed if $A$ is Hermitian or unitary. By putting $A= 0$, our result removes a regularity assumption in the single ring theorem by Guionnet, Krishnapur and Zeitouni. We also prove a local convergence on optimal scale, extending the local single ring theorem of Bao, Erd\H{o}s and Schnelli.</description>

      <title>Average Spectral Density of Multiparametric Gaussian Ensembles of Complex Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A statistical description of part of a many body system often requires a non-Hermitian random matrix ensemble with nature and strength of randomness sensitive to underlying system conditions. For the ensemble to be a good description of the system, the ensemble parameters must be determined from the system parameters. This in turn makes its necessary to analyze a wide range of multi-parametric ensembles with different kinds of matrix elements distributions. The spectral statistics of such ensembles is not only system-dependent but also non-ergodic as well as non-stationary.
  A change in system conditions can cause a change in the ensemble parameters resulting an evolution of the ensemble density and it is not sufficient to know the statistics for a given set of system conditions. This motivates us to theoretically analyze a multiparametric evolution of the ensemble averaged spectral density of a multiparametric Gaussian ensemble on the complex plane. Our analysis reveals the existence of an evolutionary route common to the ensembles belonging to same global constraint class and thereby derives a complexity parameter dependent formulation of the spectral density for the non-equilibrium regime of the spectral statistics, away from Ginibre equilibrium limit.</description>

Abstract: Pseudospherical surfaces determined by Cauchy problems involving the Camassa-Holm equation are considered herein. We study how global solutions influence the corresponding surface, as well as we investigate two sorts of singularities of the metric: the first one is just when the co-frame of dual form is not linearly independent. The second sort of singularity is that arising from solutions blowing up. In particular, it is shown that the metric blows up if and only if the solution breaks in finite time.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative SHE limit of random walks in space-time random environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that under a certain moderate deviation scaling, the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation (SHE) arises as the fluctuations of the quenched density of a 1D random walk whose transition probabilities are iid [0,1]-valued random variables. In contrast to the case of directed polymers in the intermediate disorder regime, the variance of our weights is fixed rather than vanishing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time. Consequently, taking a naive limit of the chaos expansion fails for this model, and a nontrivial noise coefficient is observed in the limit. Rather than using chaos techniques, our proof instead uses the fact that in this regime the quenched density solves a discrete SPDE which resembles the SHE. As a byproduct of our techniques, it is shown that independent noise is generated in the limit, in the sense that the prelimiting noise field does not converge to the driving noise of the limiting SPDE.</description>

Abstract: We consider the algebra of massive fermions restricted to a diamond in two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, and in the Minkowski vacuum state. While the massless modular Hamiltonian is known for this setting, the derivation of the massive one is an open problem. We compute the small-mass corrections to the modular Hamiltonian in a perturbative approach, finding some terms which were previously overlooked. Our approach can in principle be extended to all orders in the mass, even though it becomes computationally challenging.</description>

Abstract: The spectral zeta functions have been found many application in several branches of modern physics, including the quantum field theory, the string theory and the cosmology. In this paper, we shall consider the spectral zeta functions and their functional determinants in the $p$-adic field. Our approach for the constructions of $p$-adic spectral zeta functions is to apply the $p$-adic Mellin transforms with respect to locally analytic functions $f$, where $f$ interpolates the spectrum for the Hamiltonian of a quantum model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.</description>

Abstract: The marginal correlation between two variables is a measure of their linear dependence. The two original variables need not interact directly, because marginal correlation may arise from the mediation of other variables in the system. The underlying network of direct interactions can be captured by a weighted graphical model. The connection between two variables can be weighted by their partial correlation, defined as the residual correlation left after accounting for the linear effects of mediating variables. While matrix inversion can be used to obtain marginal correlations from partial correlations, in large systems this approach does not reveal how the former emerge from the latter. Here we present an expansion of marginal correlations in terms of partial correlations, which shows that the effect of mediating variables can be quantified by the weight of the paths in the graphical model that connect the original pair of variables. The expansion is proved to converge for arbitrary probability distributions. The graphical interpretation reveals a close connection between the topology of the graph and the marginal correlations. Moreover, the expansion shows how marginal correlations change when some variables are severed from the graph, and how partial correlations change when some variables are marginalised out from the description. It also establishes the minimum number of latent variables required to replicate the exact effect of a collection of variables that are marginalised out, ensuring that the partial and marginal correlations of the remaining variables remain unchanged. Notably, the number of latent variables may be significantly smaller than the number of variables that they effectively replicate. Finally, for Gaussian variables, marginal correlations are shown to be related to the efficacy with which information propagates along the paths in the graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general abstract theorem deducing wave expansions as time goes to infinity from resolvent expansions as energy goes to zero, under an assumption of polynomial boundedness of the resolvent at high energy. We give applications to obstacle scattering, to Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonians, to scattering in a sector, and to scattering by a compactly supported potential.</description>

      <title>A direct reconstruction method for radiating sources in Maxwell's equations with single-frequency data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and robust numerical method for reconstructing point-like sources in the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations given Cauchy data at a fixed frequency. This is an electromagnetic inverse source problem with broad applications, such as antenna synthesis and design, medical imaging, and pollution source tracing. We introduce new imaging functions and a computational algorithm to determine the number of point sources, their locations, and associated moment vectors, even when these vectors have notably different magnitudes. The number of sources and locations are estimated using significant peaks of the imaging functions, and the moment vectors are computed via explicitly simple formulas. The theoretical analysis and stability of the imaging functions are investigated, where the main challenge lies in analyzing the behavior of the dot products between the columns of the imaginary part of the Green's tensor and the unknown moment vectors. Additionally, we extend our method to reconstruct small-volume sources using an asymptotic expansion of their radiated electric field. We provide numerical examples in three dimensions to demonstrate the performance of our method.</description>

      <title>A geometrical Green-Naghdi type system for dispersive-like waves in prismatic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 2D free surface gravity waves in prismatic channels with bathymetric variations uniquely in the transverse direction. Starting from the Saint-Venant equations (shallow water equations) we derive a 1D transverse averaged model describing dispersive effects solely related to variations of the channel topography. These effects have been demonstrated in Chassagne et al. JFM 2019 to be predominant in the propagation of bores with Froude numbers below a critical value of about 1.15. The model proposed is fully nonlinear, Galilean invariant, and admits a variational formulation under natural assumptions about the channel geometry. It is endowed with an exact energy conservation law, and admits exact travelling wave solutions. Our model generalizes and improves the linear equations proposed by Chassagne et al. JFM 2019, as well as Quezada de Luna and Ketcheson JFM 2021. The system is recast in two useful forms appropriate for its numerical approximations, whose properties are discussed. Numerical results allow to verify against analytical solutions the implementation of these formulations, and validate our model against fully 2D nonlinear shallow water simulations, as well as the famous experiments by Treske J. Hyd. Res. 1994.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetries, closed-form solutions, and conservation laws of a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie-point symmetry method is used to find some closed-form solutions for a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials. The partial differential equation (PDE), which involves a power law with arbitrary exponent n, was investigated by Mason and his collaborators (Magan et al., Wave Motion, 77, 156-185, 2018). The Lie algebra for the model is five-dimensional for the shearing exponent n &gt; 0, and it includes translations in time, space, and displacement, as well as time-dependent changes in displacement and a scaling symmetry. Applying Lie's symmetry method, we compute the optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Using the subalgebras, several reductions and closed-form solutions for the model are obtained both for general exponent n and special case n = 1. Furthermore, it is shown that for general n &gt; 0 the model has interesting conservation laws which are computed with symbolic software using the scaling symmetry of the given PDE.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model, the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expressions for Effective Indices of Modes of Optical Fibers Near and Beyond Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the effective indices of modes of circular step-index fibers valid near their cutoff wavelengths. The approximation, being a first-order Taylor series of a smooth function, is also valid for the real part of the effective index beyond cutoff where the modes become lossy. The approximation is used to derive certain previously unknown mode properties. For example, it is shown that for non-dispersive materials the EH-mode group index at cutoff, surprisingly, does not depend on wavelength, core radius, or even radial mode order.</description>

      <title>Ambient space and integration of the trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the ambient space construction, in which spacetime is mapped into a special lightcone of a higher dimensional manifold, to derive the integrable terms of the trace anomaly in even dimensions. We argue that the natural topological anomaly is the so-called $Q$-curvature, which, when projected from the ambient space, always comes with a Weyl covariant operator that can naturally be adopted for the integration of the anomaly itself in the form of a nonlocal action. The use of the ambient space makes trasparent the fact that there are some new ambiguities in the integration of the anomaly, which we now understand geometrically from the ambient point of view. These ambiguities, which manifest themselves as undetermined parameters in the integrated nonlocal action, become more severe in dimensions $d\geq 6$ and do not seem to be related to a choice of the renormalization scheme.</description>

      <title>Stationary acoustic black hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with the idea of finding solutions that could possibly correspond to a so-called acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes. Those are flows with horizons where the speed of the flow goes from sub-sonic to super-sonic. This is because sound cannot go back from the supersonic to the subsonic region. The speed of sound plays the role of the speed of light in a gravitational black hole, an important difference being that there are excitations that can go faster than the speed of sound and therefore can escape the sonic black hole. Here, the motion of the BEC is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). More concretely, we discuss singular Stationary solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with Circular symmetry) and 3D (with Spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to study the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity of the condensate to see whether they cross, indicating the potential existence of a sonic analog of a black/white hole. We discuss numerical techniques used and also study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions to see how well they agree with numerical solutions. We also study how the resurgent transseries plays a role in these solutions.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure in the infinite volume limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus in the infinite volume limit. This measure is an invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by B. Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. We show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by B. Rider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the edge limit of Gaussian/Laguerre Beta ensembles is given by Airy($\beta$) point process. We prove an universality result that this also holds for a general class of additions of Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles. In order to make sense of $\beta$-addition, we introduce type A Bessel function as the characteristic function of our matrix ensemble following the line of Gorin-Marcus, Benaych Georges-Cuenca-Gorin. Then we extract its moment information through the action of Dunkl operators, a class of differential operators originated from special function theory. We do the action explicitly on the Bessel generating functions of our additions, and after the asymptotic analysis, we obtain certain limiting functional in terms of conditional Brownian bridges of the Laplace transform of Airy($\beta$), which is universal up to proper rescaling among all our additions.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.
  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions (and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations proper of modular forms.
  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials models.</description>

      <title>Dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formulation of subinertial stratified thermal ocean flow with identification of Casimirs as Noether quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability.
  The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler--Poincar\'e variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin--Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model's Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map.
  Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie--Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler--Poincar\'e principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints.
  The dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.</description>
