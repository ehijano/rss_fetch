      <title>An algebraic theory of Lojasiewicz exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified algebraic and valuative theory of Lojasiewicz exponents for pairs of graded families and filtrations of ideals. Within this framework, local Lojasiewicz exponents, gradient exponents, and exponents at infinity are all realized as asymptotic containment thresholds between filtrations, governed by integral closure. This reformulation shows that Lojasiewicz exponents are fundamentally valuative optimization problems.
  The central structural contribution of the paper is a finite-max principle. Under verifiable algebraic hypotheses, the a priori infinite valuative supremum bounding the Lojasiewicz exponent reduces to a finite maximum, and computes the Lojasiewicz exponent precisely. We identify two complementary mechanisms leading to this phenomenon: finite testing arising from normalized blowups and Noetherian Rees algebras, and attainment via compactness of normalized valuation spaces under linear boundedness assumptions.
  This finite-max framework yields strong structural consequences. We prove rigidity results showing that common extremal valuations force equality of Lojasiewicz ratios, and we establish stratification and stability phenomena for Lojasiewicz exponents in families, including fractional linearity and wall-chamber behavior along natural one-parameter deformations.
  The theory recovers and explains classical results in toric and Newton-polyhedral settings, particularly, for Newton nondegenete case, where the Lojasiewicz exponent is computed by finitely many toric divisorial valuations corresponding to facet data.
  Finally, we illustrate why the hypotheses underlying the finite-max principle are essential, delineating the precise scope of the theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hamming weights and symbolic powers of Stanley-Reisner ideals of matroids</title>

Abstract: It is well-known that the first generalized Hamming weight of a linear code, more commonly called \textit{the minimum distance} of the linear code, corresponds to the initial degree of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the matroid of the dual code. Our starting point in this paper is a generalization of this fact -- namely, the $r$-th generalized Hamming weight of a matroid is the smallest degree of a squarefree monomial in the $r$-th symbolic power of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the matroid (in the appropriate range for $r$). We show that the squarefree monomials in successive symbolic powers of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a matroid suffice to describe all symbolic powers of the Stanley-Reisner ideal. Hence, we provide explicit expressions for initial degree statistics of symbolic powers of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of a matroid in terms of its generalized Hamming weights. A key aspect of our approach is a careful study of duality. If the generalized Hamming weights of a matroid and its dual are both subadditive, we prove a simple expression for the initial degree of every symbolic power of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the matroid, which closely mirrors that of a uniform matroid. This has unexpectedly far-reaching consequences - we prove the generalized Hamming weights of a matroid and its dual are both subadditive for many interesting classes of matroids and codes, including sparse paving matroids, perfect matroid designs, matroids arising from Steiner systems, first-order affine and projective Reed-Muller codes, constant weight codes, Griesmer codes, and perfect codes. As an application, we study the resurgence and asymptotic resurgence of the matroid configurations introduced by Geramita-Harbourne-Migliore-Nagel. In particular, we explicitly compute the asymptotic resurgence of a matroid configuration of points arising from a perfect matroid design.</description>
