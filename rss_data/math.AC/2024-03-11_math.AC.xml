      <title>Affine Semigroup Algebras And Their Fibered Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study affine semigroup rings as algebras over subsemigroup rings. From this relative viewpoint with respect to a given subsemigroup ring, the fibered sum of two affine semigroup algebras is constructed. Such a construction is compared to the tensor product and to the classical gluings of affine semigroup rings as defined in Rosales (1997).
  While fibered sum can always be achieved, gluings of affine semigroup rings do not always exist. Therefore, we further investigate when the fibered sum of affine semigroup algebras gives rise to a gluing. A criterion is recovered in terms of the defining semigroups under which the gluing may take place.</description>

      <title>Elimination by Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field and $P=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. The technique of elimination by substitution is based on discovering a coherently $Z=(z_1,\dots,z_s)$-separating tuple of polynomials $(f_1,\dots,f_s)$ in an ideal $I$, i.e., on finding polynomials such that $f_i = z_i - h_i$ with $h_i \in K[X \setminus Z]$. Here we elaborate on this technique in the case when $P$ is non-negatively graded. The existence of a coherently $Z$-separating tuple is reduced to solving several $P_0$-module membership problems. Best separable re-embeddings, i.e., isomorphisms $P/I \longrightarrow K[X \setminus Z] / (I \cap K[X \setminus Z])$ with maximal $\#Z$, are found degree-by-degree. They turn out to yield optimal re-embeddings in the positively graded case. Viewing $P_0 \longrightarrow P/I$ as a fibration over an affine space, we show that its fibers allow optimal $Z$-separating re-embeddings, and we provide a criterion for a fiber to be isomorphic to an affine space. In the last section we introduce a new technique based on the solution of a unimodular matrix problem which enables us to construct automorphisms of $P$ such that additional $Z$-separating re-embeddings are possible. One of the main outcomes is an algorithm which allows us to explicitly compute a homogeneous isomorphism between $P/I$ and a non-negatively graded polynomial ring if $P/I$ is regular.</description>

      <title>PolyominoIdeals: a package for Macaulay2 to work with the inner $2$-minor ideals of collections of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a collection of cells and $I_\mathcal{P}$ be the associated ideal of inner $2$-minors as defined by A. A. Qureshi in 2012. In this paper, we provide a description of the package $\texttt{PolyominoIdeals}$ for the computer algebra software $\texttt{Macaulay2}$. More precisely, this package provides some functions that allow to define the ideal $I_{\mathcal{P}}$ in $\texttt{Macaulay2}$ and to compute its algebraic invariants or verifying its algebraic properties. We explain the usage of these functions and also give some examples.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are going to investigate the graded Betti numbers of powers of the edge ideals of hypergraphs in terms of combinatorial invariants. This leads us to find some combinatorial bounds for regularity of powers of the edge ideals of hypergarphs.</description>

      <title>Local log-regular rings vs toric rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local log-regular rings are a certain class of Cohen-Macaulay local rings that are treated in logarithmic geometry. Our paper aims to provide purely commutative ring theoretic proof of some ring-theoretic properties of local log-regular rings such as an explicit description of a canonical module, and the finite generation of the divisor class group.</description>

      <title>Fr\"oberg's Theorem, vertex splittability and higher independence complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated theorem of Fr\"oberg gives a complete combinatorial classification of quadratic square-free monomial ideals with a linear resolution. A generalization of this theorem to higher degree square-free monomial ideals is an active area of research. The existence of a linear resolution of such ideals often depends on the field over which the polynomial ring is defined. Hence, it is too much to expect that in the higher degree case a linear resolution can be identified purely using a combinatorial feature of an associated combinatorial structure. However, some classes of ideals having linear resolutions have been identified using combinatorial structures. In the present paper, we use the notion of $r$-independence to construct an $r$-uniform hypergraph from the given graph. We then show that when the underlying graph is co-chordal, the corresponding edge ideal is vertex splittable, a condition stronger than having a linear resolution. We use this result to explicitly compute graded Betti numbers for various graph classes. Finally, we give a different proof for the existence of a linear resolution using the topological notion of $r$-collapsibility.</description>

      <title>Some results on the vanishing of Ext and finite Gorenstein dimension of the dual of a module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive some results on the vanishing of $\operatorname{Ext}$, focusing on the condition of finiteness of the Gorenstein dimension of the dual of a module. Specifically, under this condition, we provide a generalization of a celebrated theorem by Evans and Griffith, characterize totally reflexive modules under certain contexts, and recover a result by Araya. Additionally, we prove that the Auslander-Reiten conjecture holds true for all finitely generated modules $M$ over a Noetherian local ring $R$ such that $\operatorname{G-dim}_R(\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,R))&lt;\infty$ and $\operatorname{pd}_R(\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,M))&lt;\infty$.</description>
