      <title>Pre-train and Fine-tune: Recommenders as Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reality, users have different interests in different periods, regions, scenes, etc. Such changes in interest are so drastic that they are difficult to be captured by recommenders. Existing multi-domain learning can alleviate this problem. However, the structure of the industrial recommendation system is complex, the amount of data is huge, and the training cost is extremely high, so it is difficult to modify the structure of the industrial recommender and re-train it. To fill this gap, we consider recommenders as large pre-trained models and fine-tune them. We first propose the theory of the information bottleneck for fine-tuning and present an explanation for the fine-tuning technique in recommenders. To tailor for recommendation, we design an information-aware adaptive kernel (IAK) technique to fine-tune the pre-trained recommender. Specifically, we define fine-tuning as two phases: knowledge compression and knowledge matching and let the training stage of IAK explicitly approximate these two phases. Our proposed approach designed from the essence of fine-tuning is well interpretable. Extensive online and offline experiments show the superiority of our proposed method. Besides, we also share unique and important lessons we learned when deploying the method in a large-scale online platform. We also present the potential issues of fine-tuning techniques in recommendation systems and the corresponding solutions. The recommender with IAK technique has been deployed on the homepage of a billion-scale online food platform for several months and has yielded considerable profits in our business.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Time-Aware Mixture of Experts for Multi-Modal Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal sequential recommendation (SR) leverages multi-modal data to learn more comprehensive item features and user preferences than traditional SR methods, which has become a critical topic in both academia and industry. Existing methods typically focus on enhancing multi-modal information utility through adaptive modality fusion to capture the evolving of user preference from user-item interaction sequences. However, most of them overlook the interference caused by redundant interest-irrelevant information contained in rich multi-modal data. Additionally, they primarily rely on implicit temporal information based solely on chronological ordering, neglecting explicit temporal signals that could more effectively represent dynamic user interest over time. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical time-aware Mixture of experts for multi-modal Sequential Recommendation (HM4SR) with a two-level Mixture of Experts (MoE) and a multi-task learning strategy. Specifically, the first MoE, named Interactive MoE, extracts essential user interest-related information from the multi-modal data of each item. Then, the second MoE, termed Temporal MoE, captures user dynamic interests by introducing explicit temporal embeddings from timestamps in modality encoding. To further address data sparsity, we propose three auxiliary supervision tasks: sequence-level category prediction (CP) for item feature understanding, contrastive learning on ID (IDCL) to align sequence context with user interests, and placeholder contrastive learning (PCL) to integrate temporal information with modalities for dynamic interest modeling. Extensive experiments on four public datasets verify the effectiveness of HM4SR compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage Large Language Model Pipelines Can Outperform GPT-4o in Relevance Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of search systems is evaluated using relevance labels that indicate the usefulness of documents for specific queries and users. While obtaining these relevance labels from real users is ideal, scaling such data collection is challenging. Consequently, third-party annotators are employed, but their inconsistent accuracy demands costly auditing, training, and monitoring. We propose an LLM-based modular classification pipeline that divides the relevance assessment task into multiple stages, each utilising different prompts and models of varying sizes and capabilities. Applied to TREC Deep Learning (TREC-DL), one of our approaches showed an 18.4% Krippendorff's $\alpha$ accuracy increase over OpenAI's GPT-4o mini while maintaining a cost of about 0.2 USD per million input tokens, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for relevance assessment. This approach beats the baseline performance of GPT-4o (5 USD). With a pipeline approach, even the accuracy of the GPT-4o flagship model, measured in $\alpha$, could be improved by 9.7%.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach for training o1-like RAG models that retrieve and reason over relevant information step by step before generating the final answer. Conventional RAG methods usually perform a single retrieval step before the generation process, which limits their effectiveness in addressing complex queries due to imperfect retrieval results. In contrast, our proposed method, CoRAG (Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation), allows the model to dynamically reformulate the query based on the evolving state. To train CoRAG effectively, we utilize rejection sampling to automatically generate intermediate retrieval chains, thereby augmenting existing RAG datasets that only provide the correct final answer. At test time, we propose various decoding strategies to scale the model's test-time compute by controlling the length and number of sampled retrieval chains. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks validate the efficacy of CoRAG, particularly in multi-hop question answering tasks, where we observe more than 10 points improvement in EM score compared to strong baselines. On the KILT benchmark, CoRAG establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of knowledge-intensive tasks. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive analyses to understand the scaling behavior of CoRAG, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at developing factual and grounded foundation models.</description>

      <title>Handling Heterophily in Recommender Systems with Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalised user experiences across various domains. However, capturing the heterophily patterns and the multi-dimensional nature of user-item interactions poses significant challenges. To address this, we introduce FWHDNN (Fusion-based Wavelet Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Networks), an innovative framework aimed at advancing representation learning in hypergraph-based recommendation tasks. The model incorporates three key components: (1) a cross-difference relation encoder leveraging heterophily-aware hypergraph diffusion to adapt message-passing for diverse class labels, (2) a multi-level cluster-wise encoder employing wavelet transform-based hypergraph neural network layers to capture multi-scale topological relationships, and (3) an integrated multi-modal fusion mechanism that combines structural and textual information through intermediate and late-fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FWHDNN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and scalability in capturing high-order interconnections between users and items.</description>

      <title>Remining Hard Negatives for Generative Pseudo Labeled Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrievers have demonstrated significant potential for neural information retrieval; however, they exhibit a lack of robustness to domain shifts, thereby limiting their efficacy in zero-shot settings across diverse domains. A state-of-the-art domain adaptation technique is Generative Pseudo Labeling (GPL). GPL uses synthetic query generation and initially mined hard negatives to distill knowledge from cross-encoder to dense retrievers in the target domain. In this paper, we analyze the documents retrieved by the domain-adapted model and discover that these are more relevant to the target queries than those of the non-domain-adapted model. We then propose refreshing the hard-negative index during the knowledge distillation phase to mine better hard negatives. Our remining R-GPL approach boosts ranking performance in 13/14 BEIR datasets and 9/12 LoTTe datasets. Our contributions are (i) analyzing hard negatives returned by domain-adapted and non-domain-adapted models and (ii) applying the GPL training with and without hard-negative re-mining in LoTTE and BEIR datasets.</description>

      <title>Interpretability Analysis of Domain Adapted Dense Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrievers have demonstrated significant potential for neural information retrieval; however, they exhibit a lack of robustness to domain shifts, thereby limiting their efficacy in zero-shot settings across diverse domains. Previous research has investigated unsupervised domain adaptation techniques to adapt dense retrievers to target domains. However, these studies have not focused on explainability analysis to understand how such adaptations alter the model's behavior. In this paper, we propose utilizing the integrated gradients framework to develop an interpretability method that provides both instance-based and ranking-based explanations for dense retrievers. To generate these explanations, we introduce a novel baseline that reveals both query and document attributions. This method is used to analyze the effects of domain adaptation on input attributions for query and document tokens across two datasets: the financial question answering dataset (FIQA) and the biomedical information retrieval dataset (TREC-COVID). Our visualizations reveal that domain-adapted models focus more on in-domain terminology compared to non-adapted models, exemplified by terms such as "hedge," "gold," "corona," and "disease." This research addresses how unsupervised domain adaptation techniques influence the behavior of dense retrievers when adapted to new domains. Additionally, we demonstrate that integrated gradients are a viable choice for explaining and analyzing the internal mechanisms of these opaque neural models.</description>

      <title>On Correlating Factors for Domain Adaptation Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrievers have demonstrated significant potential for neural information retrieval; however, they lack robustness to domain shifts, limiting their efficacy in zero-shot settings across diverse domains. In this paper, we set out to analyze the possible factors that lead to successful domain adaptation of dense retrievers. We include domain similarity proxies between generated queries to test and source domains. Furthermore, we conduct a case study comparing two powerful domain adaptation techniques. We find that generated query type distribution is an important factor, and generating queries that share a similar domain to the test documents improves the performance of domain adaptation methods. This study further emphasizes the importance of domain-tailored generated queries.</description>

      <title>Chat3GPP: An Open-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for 3GPP Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) documents is key standards in global telecommunications, while posing significant challenges for engineers and researchers in the telecommunications field due to the large volume and complexity of their contents as well as the frequent updates. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in natural language processing tasks, but their general-purpose nature limits their effectiveness in specific domains like telecommunications. To address this, we propose Chat3GPP, an open-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework tailored for 3GPP specifications. By combining chunking strategies, hybrid retrieval and efficient indexing methods, Chat3GPP can efficiently retrieve relevant information and generate accurate responses to user queries without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, which is both flexible and scalable, offering significant potential for adapting to other technical standards beyond 3GPP. We evaluate Chat3GPP on two telecom-specific datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods, showcasing its potential for downstream tasks like protocol generation and code automation.</description>

      <title>Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Zep, a novel memory layer service for AI agents that outperforms the current state-of-the-art system, MemGPT, in the Deep Memory Retrieval (DMR) benchmark. Additionally, Zep excels in more comprehensive and challenging evaluations than DMR that better reflect real-world enterprise use cases. While existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks for large language model (LLM)-based agents are limited to static document retrieval, enterprise applications demand dynamic knowledge integration from diverse sources including ongoing conversations and business data. Zep addresses this fundamental limitation through its core component Graphiti -- a temporally-aware knowledge graph engine that dynamically synthesizes both unstructured conversational data and structured business data while maintaining historical relationships. In the DMR benchmark, which the MemGPT team established as their primary evaluation metric, Zep demonstrates superior performance (94.8% vs 93.4%). Beyond DMR, Zep's capabilities are further validated through the more challenging LongMemEval benchmark, which better reflects enterprise use cases through complex temporal reasoning tasks. In this evaluation, Zep achieves substantial results with accuracy improvements of up to 18.5% while simultaneously reducing response latency by 90% compared to baseline implementations. These results are particularly pronounced in enterprise-critical tasks such as cross-session information synthesis and long-term context maintenance, demonstrating Zep's effectiveness for deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Customized Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks, yet their application to specialized domains remains challenging due to the need for deep expertise. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to customize LLMs for professional fields by seamlessly integrating external knowledge bases, enabling real-time access to domain-specific expertise during inference. Despite its potential, traditional RAG systems, based on flat text retrieval, face three critical challenges: (i) complex query understanding in professional contexts, (ii) difficulties in knowledge integration across distributed sources, and (iii) system efficiency bottlenecks at scale. This survey presents a systematic analysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new paradigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG addresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i) graph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity relationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval techniques that enable context-preserving knowledge retrieval with multihop reasoning ability, and (iii) structure-aware knowledge integration algorithms that leverage retrieved knowledge for accurate and logical coherent generation of LLMs. In this survey, we systematically analyze the technical foundations of GraphRAG and examine current implementations across various professional domains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research directions. All the related resources of GraphRAG, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in \textcolor{blue}{\url{https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphRAG}}.</description>

      <title>Assisting Mathematical Formalization with A Learning-based Premise Retriever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Premise selection is a crucial yet challenging step in mathematical formalization, especially for users with limited experience. Due to the lack of available formalization projects, existing approaches that leverage language models often suffer from data scarcity. In this work, we introduce an innovative method for training a premise retriever to support the formalization of mathematics. Our approach employs a BERT model to embed proof states and premises into a shared latent space. The retrieval model is trained within a contrastive learning framework and incorporates a domain-specific tokenizer along with a fine-grained similarity computation method. Experimental results show that our model is highly competitive compared to existing baselines, achieving strong performance while requiring fewer computational resources. Performance is further enhanced through the integration of a re-ranking module. To streamline the formalization process, we will release a search engine that enables users to query Mathlib theorems directly using proof states, significantly improving accessibility and efficiency. Codes are available at https://github.com/ruc-ai4math/Premise-Retrieval.</description>

      <title>CAPRAG: A Large Language Model Solution for Customer Service and Automatic Reporting using Vector and Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of new features and services in the banking sector often overwhelms customers, creating an opportunity for banks to enhance user experience through financial chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). We initiated an AI agent designed to provide customers with relevant information about banking services and insights from annual reports. We proposed a hybrid Customer Analysis Pipeline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CAPRAG) that effectively addresses both relationship-based and contextual queries, thereby improving customer engagement in the digital banking landscape. To implement this, we developed a processing pipeline to refine text data, which we utilized in two main frameworks: Vector RAG and Graph RAG. This dual approach enables us to populate both vector and graph databases with processed data for efficient retrieval. The Cypher query component is employed to effectively query the graph database. When a user submits a query, it is first expanded by a query expansion module before being routed to construct a final query from the hybrid Knowledge Base (KB). This final query is then sent to an open-source LLM for response generation. Overall, our innovative, designed to international banks, serves bank's customers in an increasingly complex digital environment, enhancing clarity and accessibility of information.</description>

      <title>MedSlice: Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Secure Clinical Note Sectioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting sections from clinical notes is crucial for downstream analysis but is challenging due to variability in formatting and labor-intensive nature of manual sectioning. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, privacy concerns limit their accessibility. This study develops a pipeline for automated note sectioning using open-source LLMs, focusing on three sections: History of Present Illness, Interval History, and Assessment and Plan. We fine-tuned three open-source LLMs to extract sections using a curated dataset of 487 progress notes, comparing results relative to proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini). Internal and external validity were assessed via precision, recall and F1 score. Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B outperformed GPT-4o (F1=0.92). On the external validity test set, performance remained high (F1= 0.85). Fine-tuned open-source LLMs can surpass proprietary models in clinical note sectioning, offering advantages in cost, performance, and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Applicable and Comprehensive Knowledge Tracing in Large-Scale Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling the modeling of students' knowledge states to predict future performance. The introduction of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), the first deep learning-based KT (DLKT) model, has brought significant advantages in terms of applicability and comprehensiveness. However, recent DLKT models, such as Attentive Knowledge Tracing (AKT), have often prioritized predictive performance at the expense of these benefits. While deep sequential models like DKT have shown potential, they face challenges related to parallel computing, storage decision modification, and limited storage capacity. To address these limitations, we propose DKT2, a novel KT model that leverages the recently developed xLSTM architecture. DKT2 enhances input representation using the Rasch model and incorporates Item Response Theory (IRT) for interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of learned knowledge into familiar and unfamiliar knowledge. By integrating this knowledge with predicted questions, DKT2 generates comprehensive knowledge states. Extensive experiments conducted across three large-scale datasets demonstrate that DKT2 consistently outperforms 17 baseline models in various prediction tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world educational applications. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementation in KT.Our code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/codebase-2025/DKT2.</description>

      <title>CAMEO: Autocorrelation-Preserving Line Simplification for Lossy Time Series Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data from a variety of sensors and IoT devices need effective compression to reduce storage and I/O bandwidth requirements. While most time series databases and systems rely on lossless compression, lossy techniques offer even greater space-saving with a small loss in precision. However, the unknown impact on downstream analytics applications requires a semi-manual trial-and-error exploration. We initiate work on lossy compression that provides guarantees on complex statistical features (which are strongly correlated with the accuracy of the downstream analytics). Specifically, we propose a new lossy compression method that provides guarantees on the autocorrelation and partial-autocorrelation functions (ACF/PACF) of a time series. Our method leverages line simplification techniques as well as incremental maintenance of aggregates, blocking, and parallelization strategies for effective and efficient compression. The results show that our method improves compression ratios by 2x on average and up to 54x on selected datasets, compared to previous lossy and lossless compression methods. Moreover, we maintain -- and sometimes even improve -- the forecasting accuracy by preserving the autocorrelation properties of the time series. Our framework is extensible to multivariate time series and other statistical features of the time series.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Provide Consistent Answers to Health-Related Questions across Languages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital for public health, but the quality of online health resources varies by language, raising concerns about inconsistencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare. In this study, we examine the consistency of responses provided by LLMs to health-related questions across English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. We largely expand the HealthFC dataset by categorizing health-related questions by disease type and broadening its multilingual scope with Turkish and Chinese translations. We reveal significant inconsistencies in responses that could spread healthcare misinformation. Our main contributions are 1) a multilingual health-related inquiry dataset with meta-information on disease categories, and 2) a novel prompt-based evaluation workflow that enables sub-dimensional comparisons between two languages through parsing. Our findings highlight key challenges in deploying LLM-based tools in multilingual contexts and emphasize the need for improved cross-lingual alignment to ensure accurate and equitable healthcare information.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Prompt Variations for Zero-shot LLM-based Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a systematic understanding of the impact of specific components and wordings used in prompts on the effectiveness of rankers based on zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs). Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.</description>

      <title>DEEPER: Dense Electroencephalography Passage Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in Information Retrieval (IR) is the cognitive burden of translating internal information needs into explicit textual queries. This translation barrier particularly affects users with undefined information needs or those who face physical constraints in traditional text input methods. While Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have emerged as a potential solution for direct neural query interpretation, existing approaches that attempt to convert brain signals into text queries have demonstrated limited success in capturing the complexity of neural semantic patterns. This paper introduces DEEPER Dense EEG Passage Retrieval, a novel framework that bypasses the need for explicit query translation by directly mapping electroencephalography (EEG) signals to relevant text passages. Our approach employs dense retrieval architectures to create a unified semantic space where both EEG signals and text passages can be effectively compared. Experimental evaluation on the ZuCo dataset shows that DEEPER substantially outperforms current EEG-to-text baselines, achieving nearly 5x improvement in retrieval precision while demonstrating robust performance across a diverse set of 30 participants. Through detailed ablation analysis, we identify key architectural components, including specialized neural encoders and strategic negative sampling techniques, that enable effective cross-modal semantic alignment. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of direct EEG passage retrieval and suggest new possibilities for developing IR systems that can more naturally interface with users' cognitive processes.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic for Live Stream Allocation in Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement, thus improving dwelling time and improving user retention. In the context of a short video &amp; live stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to inject at most one live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream injection policy for accurate live stream allocation. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, and these issues may cause too many live stream allocation, which interrupts user's short video interest and leads to a decrease in the user's app usage duration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the platform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Evaluation of Quantification Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03223v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantification represents the problem of estimating the distribution of class labels on unseen data. It also represents a growing research field in supervised machine learning, for which a large variety of different algorithms has been proposed in recent years. However, a comprehensive empirical comparison of quantification methods that supports algorithm selection is not available yet. In this work, we close this research gap by conducting a thorough empirical performance comparison of 24 different quantification methods on overall more than 40 data sets, considering binary as well as multiclass quantification settings. We observe that no single algorithm generally outperforms all competitors, but identify a group of methods including the threshold selection-based Median Sweep and TSMax methods, the DyS framework including the HDy method, Forman's mixture model, and Friedman's method that performs best in the binary setting. For the multiclass setting, we observe that a different, broad group of algorithms yields good performance, including the HDx method, the Generalized Probabilistic Adjusted Count, the readme method, the energy distance minimization method, the EM algorithm for quantification, and Friedman's method. We also find that tuning the underlying classifiers has in most cases only a limited impact on the quantification performance. More generally, we find that the performance on multiclass quantification is inferior to the results obtained in the binary setting. Our results can guide practitioners who intend to apply quantification algorithms and help researchers to identify opportunities for future research.</description>

      <title>Graph Regularized Encoder Training for Extreme Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep extreme classification (XC) aims to train an encoder architecture and an accompanying classifier architecture to tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from a very large universe of labels. XC applications in ranking, recommendation and tagging routinely encounter tail labels for which the amount of training data is exceedingly small. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) present a convenient but computationally expensive way to leverage task metadata and enhance model accuracies in these settings. This paper formally establishes that in several use cases, the steep computational cost of GCNs is entirely avoidable by replacing GCNs with non-GCN architectures. The paper notices that in these settings, it is much more effective to use graph data to regularize encoder training than to implement a GCN. Based on these insights, an alternative paradigm RAMEN is presented to utilize graph metadata in XC settings that offers significant performance boosts with zero increase in inference computational costs. RAMEN scales to datasets with up to 1M labels and offers prediction accuracy up to 15% higher on benchmark datasets than state of the art methods, including those that use graph metadata to train GCNs. RAMEN also offers 10% higher accuracy over the best baseline on a proprietary recommendation dataset sourced from click logs of a popular search engine. Code for RAMEN will be released publicly.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces GraFPrint, an audio identification framework that leverages the structural learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to create robust audio fingerprints. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph from time-frequency representations and applies max-relative graph convolutions to encode local and global information. The network is trained using a self-supervised contrastive approach, which enhances resilience to ambient distortions by optimizing feature representation. GraFPrint demonstrates superior performance on large-scale datasets at various levels of granularity, proving to be both lightweight and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications with extensive reference databases.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sequential Recommendation Models with Scaling Laws and Approximate Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00430v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling Laws have emerged as a powerful framework for understanding how model performance evolves as they increase in size, providing valuable insights for optimizing computational resources. In the realm of Sequential Recommendation (SR), which is pivotal for predicting users' sequential preferences, these laws offer a lens through which to address the challenges posed by the scalability of SR models. However, the presence of structural and collaborative issues in recommender systems prevents the direct application of the Scaling Law (SL) in these systems. In response, we introduce the Performance Law for SR models, which aims to theoretically investigate and model the relationship between model performance and data quality. Specifically, we first fit the HR and NDCG metrics to transformer-based SR models. Subsequently, we propose Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to assess data quality, presenting a more nuanced approach compared to traditional data quantity metrics. Our method enables accurate predictions across various dataset scales and model sizes, demonstrating a strong correlation in large SR models and offering insights into achieving optimal performance for any given model configuration.</description>

      <title>Auto-Cypher: Improving LLMs on Cypher generation via LLM-supervised generation-verification framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph databases like Neo4j are gaining popularity for handling complex, interconnected data, over traditional relational databases in modeling and querying relationships. While translating natural language into SQL queries is well-researched, generating Cypher queries for Neo4j remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we present an automated, LLM-Supervised, pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic data for Text2Cypher. Our Cypher data generation pipeline introduces LLM-As-Database-Filler, a novel strategy for ensuring Cypher query correctness, thus resulting in high quality generations. Using our pipeline, we generate high quality Text2Cypher data - SynthCypher containing 29.8k instances across various domains and queries with varying complexities. Training open-source LLMs like LLaMa-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and QWEN-7B on SynthCypher results in performance gains of up to 40% on the Text2Cypher test split and 30% on the SPIDER benchmark, adapted for graph databases.</description>

      <title>Sequence Generation Modeling for Continuous Value Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous value prediction (CVP) plays a crucial role in short video recommendation, capturing user preferences through precise numerical estimations. However, traditional regression-based methods often struggle with challenges like wide value ranges and imbalanced data, leading to prediction bias. While ordinal classification approaches have been introduced to address these issues, their reliance on discretization reduces accuracy and overlooks inherent relationships between intervals. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel Generative Regression (GR) framework for CVP, inspired by sequence generation techniques in language modeling. Our method transforms numerical values into token sequences through structural discretization, preserving original data fidelity while improving prediction precision. Leveraging a carefully crafted vocabulary and label encoding, GR employs curriculum learning with an embedding mixup strategy to bridge training-inference gaps. Experimental evaluations on four public datasets and one large-scale industrial dataset validate the superiority of GR over existing methods. Real-world A/B tests on Kuaishou, a leading video platform, further demonstrate its practical effectiveness. Additionally, GR proves adaptable to other regression tasks, such as Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, showcasing its potential as a robust solution for diverse CVP challenges.</description>
