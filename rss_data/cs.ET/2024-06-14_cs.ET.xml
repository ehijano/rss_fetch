      <title>Harnessing Quantum Entanglement: Comprehensive Strategies for Enhanced Communication and Beyond in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication represents a revolutionary advancement over classical information theory, which leverages unique quantum mechanics properties like entanglement to achieve unprecedented capabilities in secure and efficient information transmission. Unlike bits in classical communication, quantum communication utilizes qubits in superposition states, allowing for novel information storage and processing. Entanglement, a key quantum phenomenon, enables advanced protocols with enhanced security and processing power. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of quantum communication, emphasizing the role of entanglement in theoretical foundations, practical protocols, experimental progress, and security implications. It contrasts quantum communications potential applications with classical networks, identifying areas where entanglement offers significant advantages. The paper explores the fundamentals of quantum mechanics in communication, the physical realization of quantum information, and the formation of secure quantum networks through entanglement-based strategies like Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and teleportation. It addresses the challenges of long-distance quantum communication, the role of quantum repeaters in scaling networks, and the conceptualization of interconnected quantum networks. Additionally, it discusses strides towards the Quantum Internet, Quantum Error-Correcting codes, and quantum cryptographys role in ensuring secure communication. By highlighting the role of entanglement, this paper aims to inspire further research and innovation in secure and efficient information exchange within quantum networks.</description>

      <title>On the Simulation Power of Surface Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) is a well-studied model that describes the interaction of molecules in well-mixed solutions. In 2014, Qian and Winfree [22] proposed the abstract surface chemical reaction network model (sCRN), which takes the advantage of spatial separation by placing molecules on a structured surface, limiting the interaction between molecules. In this model, molecules can only react with their immediate neighbors. Many follow up works study the computational and pattern-construction power of sCRNs. In this work, our goal is to describe the power of sCRN by relating the model to other well-studied models in distributed computation. In this work, our main result is to show that, given the same initial configuration, sCRN, affinity strengthening tile automata, cellular automata, and amoebot can all simulate each other (up to unavoidable rotation and reflection of the pattern). One of our techniques is a coloring on-the-fly, which allows all molecules in sCRN to have a global orientation.</description>

      <title>Superconductor bistable vortex memory for data storage and in-memory computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor electronics (SCE) is a promising complementary and beyond CMOS technology. However, despite its practical benefits, the realization of SCE logic faces a significant challenge due to the absence of dense and scalable nonvolatile memory designs. While various nonvolatile memory technologies, including Non-destructive readout, vortex transitional memory (VTM), and magnetic memory, have been explored, achieving a superconductor random-access memory (RAM) crossbar array remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel, nonvolatile, high-density, and scalable VTM cell design for SCE applications. Our proposed design addresses scaling issues while boasting zero static power consumption characteristics. Our design leverages current summation, enabling analog multiply-accumulate operations -an essential feature for many in-memory computational tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a 32 x 32 superconductor memory array operating at 20 GHz. This design effectively addresses scaling issues and utilizes current summation that can be used for analog multiply-accumulate operations. Additionally, we showcase the accumulation property of the memory through analog simulations conducted on an 8 x 8 superconductor crossbar array.</description>

      <title>How Decentralization Affects User Agency on Social Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mainstream social media platforms function as "walled garden" ecosystems that restrict user agency, control, and data portability. They have demonstrated a lack of transparency that contributes to a multitude of online harms. Our research investigates how decentralization might present promise as an alternative model to walled garden platforms. Specifically, we describe the user-driven content moderation through blocks as an expression of agency on Bluesky, a decentralized social platform. We examine the impact of providing users with more granular control over their online experiences, including what they post, who can see it, and whose content they are exposed to. We describe the patterns identified in user-driven content moderation and suggest directions for further research.</description>

      <title>$Classi|Q\rangle$ Towards a Translation Framework To Bridge The Classical-Quantum Programming Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, albeit readily available as hardware or emulated on the cloud, is still far from being available in general regarding complex programming paradigms and learning curves. This vision paper introduces $Classi|Q\rangle$, a translation framework idea to bridge Classical and Quantum Computing by translating high-level programming languages, e.g., Python or C++, into a low-level language, e.g., Quantum Assembly. Our idea paper serves as a blueprint for ongoing efforts in quantum software engineering, offering a roadmap for further $Classi|Q\rangle$ development to meet the diverse needs of researchers and practitioners. $Classi|Q\rangle$ is designed to empower researchers and practitioners with no prior quantum experience to harness the potential of hybrid quantum computation. We also discuss future enhancements to $Classi|Q\rangle$, including support for additional quantum languages, improved optimization strategies, and integration with emerging quantum computing platforms.</description>
