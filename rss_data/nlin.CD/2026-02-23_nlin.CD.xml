      <title>Universal Second-Order Phase Transition from Integrability to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a dynamical phase transition from integrability to non-integrability in a simple oval-like billiard with boundary $R(\theta)=1+\epsilon\cos(p\theta)$. For $\epsilon=0$, the phase space is {\it foliated} by invariant curves corresponding to periodic or quasiperiodic motion, whereas for small $\epsilon$ a thin chaotic layer separates rotational and librational trajectories. As $\epsilon$ increases, this layer grows according to a well-defined scaling law whose chaotic dispersion follows $\omega_{\rm rms,sat}\sim\epsilon^{\tilde{\alpha}}$, where the exponent $\tilde{\alpha}$ coincides with those of the Fermi-Ulam model, periodically corrugated waveguides, and a family of discrete mappings, revealing a universal mechanism for the onset of chaos in weakly perturbed integrable systems. The deviation of the reflection angle in the billiard, $\omega_{\rm rms,sat}$, acts as an order parameter: it vanishes continuously as $\epsilon\to 0$, signalling an ordered (integrable) phase, while its susceptibility $\chi=d\omega_{\rm rms,sat}/d\epsilon$ diverges, indicating a second-order phase transition. A symmetry breaking and an analytically solvable diffusion process complete the near-critical phenomenology. These results establish a unified framework for the emergence of chaos from integrability.</description>

      <title>Describing a Universal Critical Behavior in a transition from order to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive discussion of a transition from integrability to non-integrability in an oval billiard with a static boundary. This transition is controlled by a deformation parameter $\epsilon$, which modifies the boundary shape from circular, corresponding to $\epsilon=0$ and an integrable dynamics, to oval for $\epsilon\neq 0$, where non-integrability emerges. The deformation of the circular billiard gives rise to a chaotic layer that develops along a well-defined stripe in phase space. By introducing a set of transformations that isolate this chaotic stripe, we characterise the diffusive spreading of ensembles of trajectories and identify an observable, $\omega_{rms,{\rm sat}}$, which plays the role of an order parameter for the transition. For small deformations, the saturation value of the diffusion obeys the scaling law $\omega_{rms,{\rm sat}}\propto\epsilon^{\tilde{\alpha}}$, with a critical exponent $\tilde{\alpha}=0.507(2)$, vanishing continuously as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. The associated susceptibility, $\chi=d\omega_{rms,{\rm sat}}/d\epsilon$, diverges in the same limit, signalling the presence of critical behavior analogous to that observed in second-order (continuous) phase transitions in statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of a vertical pendulum driven by magnetic field provided by two coils magnets: analytical, numerical and experimental studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyzed theoretically and experimentally the nonlinear dynamics of a magnetic pendulum excited through the interactions of a strong neodymium magnet and two coils placed symmetrically around the zero angular position. The forces between the magnet and coils and generated torques acting on the pendulum are derived using the magnetic charges interaction model and an experimentally fitted model. System equilibrium points are obtained, and their stability is investigated. It is found that when the currents in two coils are negative, the shape of the mechanical potential is bistable. The bistable potential might be symmetric if the currents have the same values and asymmetric when they are different. Asymmetric bistable potential is observed when coil currents have different signs. However, in the case of positive coil currents, a symmetric tristable potential is detected when the currents are the same, and an asymmetric tristable potential takes place when the positive currents have different values. Considering the sinusoidal coil current signals, analytical calculations using the harmonic balance method and numerical simulations are carried out for this electric-magneto-mechanical system. The obtained results are shown in terms of frequency-response diagrams, displacement time series, and phase portraits. The two-parameter bifurcation diagrams are plotted showing the different dynamical behaviors considering the current amplitudes and frequency as the control parameters. Amplitude jumps, hysteresis, and multistability are also observed. Some phase portraits and the coexistence of attractors are obtained numerically and confirmed experimentally. A good agreement between the numerical simulation and experimental measurement is achieved.</description>

      <title>Scaling invariance: a bridge between geometry, dynamics and criticality</title>

Abstract: Scale invariance is a central organizing principle in physics, underlying phenomena that range from critical behaviour in statistical mechanics to transport and chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here we present a unified and physically motivated exploration of scaling concepts, emphasizing how invariance under rescaling transformations emerges across systems of increasing dynamical complexity. Rather than adopting a purely abstract approach, we combine simple geometrical constructions, analytical arguments, and prototypical dynamical models to build physical intuition. We begin with elementary, easily reproducible examples governed by a single control parameter, showing how power-law behaviour naturally arises when characteristic scales are absent. We then extend the discussion to nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting local bifurcations, where two scaling variables control the relaxation toward stationary states. In this context, scaling invariance manifests through critical exponents, crossover phenomena, and critical slowing down, allowing systems of different dimensionality to be grouped into universality classes. Finally, we address continuous phase transitions in chaotic dynamical systems, including transitions from integrability to non-integrability and from bounded to unbounded diffusion. By drawing on concepts traditionally associated with statistical mechanics, such as order parameters, susceptibilities, symmetry breaking, elementary excitations, and topological defects, we show how these transitions can be interpreted within a coherent scaling framework. Taken together, the examples discussed here demonstrate that scaling invariance provides a unifying language for understanding structure, transport, and criticality in nonlinear systems, bridging deterministic dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical physics in a transparent and physically intuitive manner.</description>

      <title>Adaptive transitions in FitzHugh-Nagumo networks with Hebb-Oja coupling rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive coupling in networks of interacting neurons has gained recent attention due to the many applications both in biological and in artificial neural networks, where adaptive coupling or synaptic plasticity is considered as a key factor in learning processes. In the present study, we apply adaptive connectivity rules in networks of interacting FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators. Adaptive coupling, here, is realized via Hebbian learning adjusted by the Oja rule to prevent the network link weights from growing without bounds. Numerical investigations demonstrate that during the adaptation process the FitzHugh-Nagumo network undergoes adaptive transitions realizing traveling waves, synchronized states and chimera states transiting through various multiplicities. These transitions become more evident when the time scales governing the coupling dynamics are much slower than the ones governing the nodal dynamics (nodal potentials). Namely, when the coupling time scales are slow, the network has the time to realize and demonstrate different synchronization regimes before reaching the final steady state. The transitions can be observed not only in the spacetime plots but also in the abrupt changes of the average coupling weights as the network evolves in time. Regarding the asymptotic coupling distributions, we show that the limiting average coupling strength follows an inverse power law with respect to the Oja parameter (also called "forgetting" parameter) which balances the learning growth. We also report abrupt transitions in the asymptotic coupling strengths when the parameter related to adaptive coupling crosses from fast to slow time scales. These findings are in line with previous studies on spiking neural networks.</description>

      <title>Accurate Data-Based State Estimation from Power Loads Inference in Electric Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation is a crucial requirement for the reliable operation and control of electric power systems. Here, we construct a data-driven, numerical method to infer missing power load values in large-scale power grids. Given partial observations of power demands, the method estimates the operational state using a linear regression algorithm, exploiting statistical correlations within synthetic training datasets. We evaluate the performance of the method on three synthetic transmission grid test systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by the method in reconstructing missing demand values under various operating conditions. We further apply the method to real data for the transmission power grid of Switzerland. Despite the restricted number of observations in this dataset, the method infers missing power loads rather accurately. Furthermore, Newton-Raphson power flow solutions show that deviations between true and inferred values for power loads result in smaller deviations between true and inferred values for flows on power lines. This ensures that the estimated operational state correctly captures potential line contingencies. Overall, our results indicate that simple data-based regression techniques can provide an efficient and reliable alternative for state estimation in modern power grids.</description>

      <title>Participation Ratio as a Quantum Probe of Hierarchical Stickiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how quantum localization encodes the hierarchical stickiness that governs transport in mixed classical phase spaces. Using the periodically driven kicked top, we show that the participation ratio (PR) of coherent states in the Floquet eigenbasis resolves the same layered structure that appears classically as a multimodal distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs). To establish a quantitative correspondence, we introduce a Gaussian coarse graining of the FTLE matched to the intrinsic semiclassical resolution of coherent states. Both local correlations and global comparisons of probability distributions demonstrate that quantum and classical indicators agree optimally within a finite window of evolution times, where sticky structures are most clearly resolved. Our results promote the participation ratio from a global measure of chaos to a sensitive probe of hierarchical transport and provide a practical route for diagnosing anomalous localization in driven quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Spectral Analysis Through Pseudo-Resolvent Koopman Operator in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for spectral analysis of the Koopman operator based on direct construction of the pseudo-resolvent from time-series data. Finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator, such as those obtained from Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition, are known to suffer from spectral pollution. To address this issue, we construct the pseudo-resolvent operator using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity whose norm serves as a spectral indicator, and pseudoeigenfunctions are extracted as directions of maximal amplification. We establish convergence of the approximate spectrum to the true spectrum in the Hausdorff metric for isolated eigenvalues, with preservation of algebraic multiplicities, and derive error bounds for eigenvalue approximation. Numerical experiments on pendulum, Lorenz, and coupled oscillator systems demonstrate that the method effectively suppresses spectral pollution and resolves closely spaced spectral components.</description>
