      <title>Exploring DHCAL design and performance with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of a gaseous-based DHCAL, we investigate the potential of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for hadron energy reconstruction and particle identification (PID) in future collider experiments. For PID, we demonstrate an accuracy of approximately 90% for neutrons and pions, and near 100% for neutral kaons and protons. The energy resolution for these hadrons is studied up to 50 GeV, with an additional investigation into the resolution as a function of the incoming particle angle and readout granularity using pions. Compared to traditional analysis methods, our results suggest that improved performance could be achieved even with coarser detector granularity, potentially making future DHCAL systems more cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Estimating detector systematic uncertainties for the T2K far detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that measures oscillation parameters related to both $\nu_\mu(\bar{\nu}_\mu)$ disappearance and $\nu_e(\bar{\nu}_e)$ appearance in a $\nu_\mu(\bar{\nu}_\mu)$ beam. T2K uses Super-Kamiokande (SK) as its far detector, and SK detector systematic errors are currently among the leading sources of systematic uncertainty in the T2K oscillation analysis. Therefore, accurate understanding of detector mis-modelling and event reconstruction uncertainties in SK is crucial to the extraction of the neutrino oscillation parameters. The detector error estimation procedure quantifies uncertainties by fitting SK atmospheric MC to data in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. Uncertainties are separated based on true event topology above Cherenkov threshold in the SK atmospheric MC in order to capture how the uncertainties should affect the different signal and background samples when propagated to the T2K beam oscillation analysis. The procedure has been upgraded for the upcoming analysis cycle to include systematics targeting newly added $\nu_eCC1\pi^\pm$ and $NC\pi^0$-enhanced analysis samples, among other changes, culminating in a 540 dimensional MCMC fit between atmospheric MC and data in SK. The far detector analysis chain and its integration into the broader T2K oscillation analysis will be discussed in these proceedings.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Pulse width modulation techniques of modular multilevel converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a promising converter technology for various highvoltage high-power applications. The reason to that is low-distortion output quantities can be achieved with low average switching frequencies per switch and without output filters. Modular multilevel converter pulse width modulation based control approaches are evaluated. The multicarrier PWM techniques such as Phase disposition PWM (PDPWM), Phase opposition disposition PWM (PODPWM), Alternate phase opposition disposition PWM (APODPWM) is employed and a comparative study is done based on the quality of the load voltage and load current output. This paper presents the simulation of single phase modular multilevel converter based on Half-Bridge sub module topology. Simulation has been carried out for various modulation techniques using MATLAB/Simulink and the results are observed.</description>

      <title>Energy reconstruction and calibration techniques of the DUNE LArTPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology is currently a preferred choice for neutrino experiments and beyond the standard model physics searches such as nucleon decay and dark matter. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will employ the LArTPC technology at a large scale for physics programs, benefiting from its large target mass and excellent imaging, tracking, and particle identification capabilities. In DUNE, accurate energy reconstruction is important for precisely measuring CP violation, determining neutrino mass ordering and fully utilising the detector's potential. The energy calibration techniques developed for the DUNE far detector (FD) horizontal drift are presented here, utilising stopping cosmic-ray muons and validating the methods with the stopping pions and protons. The study demonstrates the versatility of the calibration techniques, applicable to other LArTPC, and valid for different particles. The electromagnetic shower energy reconstruction from $\pi^{0} \rightarrow 2\gamma$ events and the subsequent reconstruction of $\pi^{0}$ mass are also presented. These are important calibrations which address the measurement of energy loss in the DUNE FD volume and are critical for achieving the exciting physics goals of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Estimating the track-reconstruction efficiency in phenomenological proposals of long-lived-particle searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenomenological proposals of searches for new, long-lived particles face a challenge when estimating the reconstruction efficiency of displaced charged-particle tracks. The efficiency depends not only on the charged-particle's momentum vector, but also on its production point in relation to the detector boundary and substructure elements. Phenomenological studies generally do not have access to GEANT4-based simulation, which is used for calculating the efficiency in experimental analyses. To address this need, we have developed TrackEff, a python software package for estimating the track-reconstruction efficiency. The default detector geometry within TrackEff is that of the Belle~II drift chamber. However, tunable parameters enable modification of the geometry to correspond to other tracker configurations. TrackEff uses a simplified model of the tracker to determine the number of detector hits associated with each track. The user can then decide whether the track would be detected based on the number of hits, potentially in association with any other information.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Hardware Acceleration in High-Energy Physics through High-Level Synthesis Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Large Hadron Collider, the vast amount of data from experiments demands not only sophisticated algorithms but also substantial computational power for efficient processing. This paper introduces hardware acceleration as an essential advancement for high-energy physics data analysis, focusing specifically on the application of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to bridge the gap between complex software algorithms and their hardware implementation. We will explore how HLS facilitates the direct implementation of software algorithms into hardware platforms such as FPGAs, enhancing processing speeds and enabling real-time data analysis. This will be highlighted through the case study of a track-finding algorithm for muon reconstruction with the CMS experiment, demonstrating HLS's role in translating computational tasks into high-speed, low-latency hardware solutions for particle detection and reconstruction. Key techniques in HLS, including parallel processing, pipelining, and memory optimization, will be discussed, illustrating how they contribute to the efficient acceleration of algorithms in high-energy physics. We will also cover design methodologies and iterative processes in HLS to optimize performance and resource utilization, alongside a brief mention of additional techniques like algorithm approximation and hardware / software co-design. In short, this paper will underscore the potential of hardware acceleration in high-energy physics research, emphasizing HLS as a powerful tool for physicists to enhance computational efficiency and foster groundbreaking discoveries.</description>

      <title>Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Finite width effects in nonleptonic D-decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many analyses of two-body non-leptonic decays of $D$-mesons rely on flavor SU(3) symmetry relations and fits of experimental data of decays rates to extract the universal transition amplitudes. Such fits assume that the final state mesons are well-defined asymptotic states of QCD. We develop a technique to take into account the finite width effects of the final state mesons and study their effects on the extracted values of transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Update on non-unitary mixing in the recent NO$\nu$A and T2K data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we have used a non-unitary mixing scheme to resolve the tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K data. It is demonstrated that the results of NO$\nu$A and T2K can be explained by the effects by non-unitary mixing arising from $\alpha_{00}$ and $\alpha_{10}$. For $\alpha_{00}$ there is a large overlap between the allowed NO$\nu$A and T2K regions for NH on the $\sin^2\theta_{23}-\delta_{\rm CP}$ plane at $1\,\sigma$. However, the tension still exists. NO$\nu$A rules out unitary mixing at a $3\,\sigma$ level, whereas T2K strongly prefers unitary mixing. For $\alpha_{10}$, the tension can be \textbf{well resolved} with the best-fit point for NH at $|\alpha_{10}|=0.06$ for both experiments.</description>

Abstract: In case of a successful scattering event of a high-energy matter beam on a Dark Matter (DM) particle, the DM mass can be directly measured without probing the New Physics (NP) interaction.

      <title>Probing $B^+ \to K^+$ semi-leptonic FCNC decay with new physics effects under PQCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Belle II Collaboration reported the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu})=(2.3\pm0.7)\times10^{-5}$ with a significance of $3.5\sigma$, which is $2.7\sigma$ above the SM expectation. Motivated by this measurement, we calculate this decay channel at the NLO and twist-3 level using the PQCD approach. By combining the lattice QCD data and our results, we obtain form factors with improved accuracy. Using these form factors, we precisely estimate the branching ratios of $B^+ \to K^+$ semileptonic FCNC decays, including $B^+ \to K^+\nu\bar\nu$ and $B^+ \to K^+\ell^+\ell^-$. To explain the anomalies in these two processes, we introduce a leptoquark model as a new physics scenario. Using five possible types of leptoquarks, we successfully explain the latest experimental measurements, and further constraints on the leptoquarks are derived.</description>

      <title>Vector meson production associated with a lepton pair in $e^+$ $e^-$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a novel production mechanism of vector mesons, exemplified by the production of a neutral vector meson associated with a lepton pair in $e^+e^-$ annihilation, i.e., $e^+e^-\to V l^+l^-$ ($V=J/\psi, \rho^0, \omega, \phi$, and $l=\mu, \tau$). These vector meson production channels can be precisely accounted within QED. The production rates of these processes are dominated by those diagrams where the vector meson is emitted from either the incident electron or positron, which exhibit a $\ln^2 m_l^2$ enhancement stemming from the triple collinear limit of leptons. Our numerical analysis indicates that the corresponding production rates are substantial enough to warrant the observation of these novel vector meson production channels at BESIII and Belle II experiments in near future.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in tellurium-based dark matter searches stemming from nuclear structure uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tellurium dioxide as a target, we calculate uncertainties on 90% upper confidence limits of Galilean effective field theory (Galilean EFT) couplings to a WIMP dark matter particle due to uncertainties in nuclear shell models. We find that these uncertainties in naturally-occurring tellurium isotopes are comparable across the different Galilean EFT couplings to uncertainties in xenon, with some reaching over 100%. We also consider the effect these nuclear uncertainties have on estimates of the annual modulation of dark matter from these searches, finding that the uncertainties in the modulation amplitude are proportional to the non-modulating upper confidence limit uncertainties. We also show that the determination of the modulation phase is insensitive to changes in the nuclear model for a given isotope.</description>

      <title>Strangeness in the proton from W+charm production and SIDIS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a global QCD analysis of unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton, including new $W +\,$charm production data from $pp$ collisions at the LHC, which have been suggested for constraining the strange quark PDF. In particular, we assess the impact of the $W +\,$charm data relative to that of semi-inclusive pion and kaon production data in lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering. Compared with a baseline global fit that does not include these datasets, we find that semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering and $W +\,$charm data combined favor a larger strange distribution, but smaller than the SU(3) symmetric sea suggested in previous analyses of ATLAS data. Combined, the ratio of strange to nonstrange sea quark distributions is $R_s = (s+\bar s)/(\bar u+\bar d) \approx \{ 0.72,\, 0.48,\, 0.26 \}$ for $x = \{ 0.01,\, 0.04,\, 0.1 \}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a high-performance Soft-Core Processor based data acquisition system designed for handling Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs). The DAQ consist of FPGA-based hardware equipped with Soft-Core Processor and embedded hardwired Ethernet controllers named RPC-DAQ, offering a versatile and fast network-enabled data acquisition solution. A soft processor, NIOS, is instantiated within an Intel Cyclone IV FPGA, overseeing control, communication, and data transfer with remote processing units. These integrated RPC-DAQ units, in substantial numbers, connect to a limited set of high-end processing units via LAN switches. This paper provides a detailed account of the software implementation scheme for the NIOS processor in the RPC-DAQ system. A remarkable 28,800 RPC-DAQ units will be deployed in proximity to the RPCs, serving the proposed INO-ICAL experiment in Theni-Madurai, Tamil Nadu. The network-enabled RPC-DAQ units controlled by the soft processor offloads FPGA tasks including event data acquisition, periodic health monitoring of RPCs, command interfaces, high voltage control, and data transfer to back-end data concentrators. Communication and data transfer are executed efficiently via TCP and UDP protocols over a 100 Mbps Ethernet interface. This system provides innovative solutions to improve data acquisition and control in large-scale scientific experiments.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Measurement of the Reactor Antineutrino Spectrum and Flux at Daya Bay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter reports the precise measurement of reactor antineutrino spectrum and flux based on the full data set of 4.7 million inverse-beta-decay (IBD) candidates collected at Daya Bay near detectors. Expressed in terms of the IBD yield per fission, the antineutrino spectra from all reactor fissile isotopes and the specific $\mathrm{^{235}U}$ and $\mathrm{^{239}Pu}$ isotopes are measured with 1.3$\%$, 3$\%$ and 8$\%$ uncertainties respectively near the 3 MeV spectrum peak in reconstructed energy, reaching the best precision in the world. The total antineutrino flux and isotopic $\mathrm{^{235}U}$ and $\mathrm{^{239}Pu}$ fluxes are precisely measured to be $5.84\pm0.07$, $6.16\pm0.12$ and $4.16\pm0.21$ in units of $10^{-43} \mathrm{cm^2/fission}$. These measurements are compared with the Huber-Mueller (HM) model, the reevaluated conversion model based on the Kurchatov Institute (KI) measurement and the latest Summation Model (SM2023). The Daya Bay flux shows good consistency with KI and SM2023 models, but disagrees with HM model. The Daya Bay spectrum, however, disagrees with all model predictions.</description>

      <title>Exploring QGP-like phenomena with Charmonia in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultra-relativistic collisions of nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider, the created QCD environment rapidly changes, leading to a non-adiabatic evolution of the quantum states involved. Considering this, we first examine the pre-equilibrium state of QCD matter and its effect on the initially produced charmonium using a temperature-independent Hamiltonian. As the QCD matter reaches local thermal equilibrium, this Hamiltonian transforms to its finite temperature counterpart. To model the pre-equilibrium stage, we use the bottom-up thermalization approach to determine the effective temperature of the QCD matter, followed by a Gubser-type expansion for the thermalized medium. Additionally, we consider collisional damping, gluonic dissociation, and regeneration mechanisms, which specifically modify the charmonium yield in the thermalized medium. Mainly, the gluonic dissociation and collisional damping cause a reduction in the yield conversely, regeneration through gluonic de-excitation enhances the yield of charmonium. Further, we explore the combined effects of these mechanisms on the collective yield of charmonium states with transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and event multiplicity in the proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Based on our findings, we contend that the combined effects of these mechanisms can serve as a robust probe for determining the possible existence of a thermalized QCD medium in such a small collision system.</description>

      <title>Trilepton and tetralepton bound and resonant states: the QED counterpart of multiquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first prediction of tetralepton resonant states containing muons, extending beyond the simplest tetralepton system, dipositronium ($\mathrm{Ps}_2$). With the rapid advancements in experimental facilities, the production and study of these intriguing states may be within reach. We perform a comprehensive analysis of S-wave trilepton and tetralepton systems within the framework of a QED Coulomb potential. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the three- or four-body Schr\"odinger equation and utilize the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. We uncover a series of bound and resonant states in the trilepton systems $e^+e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-$, $e^+e^+\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-$, as well as the tetralepton systems $e^+e^+e^-e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-e^-$. The energies of these states range from $-30$ eV to $-1$ eV below the total mass of three or four leptons, with their widths varying from less than $0.01$ eV to approximately $0.07$ eV. Additionally, we calculate the spin configurations and root mean square radii of these states, providing insight into their spatial structures. No bound or resonant states are found in the trilepton $e^+\mu^+e^-$, $\mu^+e^+\mu^-$ systems, nor in the tetralepton $\mu^+e^+\mu^-e^-$ system. A comparison with fully heavy tetraquark systems reveals that the additional color degree of freedom in QCD results in the absence of low-energy bound and resonant states. However, this extra degree of freedom allows for a broader range of $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers to produce resonant states, highlighting the rich complexity of QCD systems.</description>

      <title>$B \to \rho \ell \bar{\nu}$ resonance form factors from $B \to \pi\pi \ell \bar{\nu}$ in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay $B \to \rho \ell \bar{\nu}$ is an attractive process for determining the magnitude of the smallest CKM matrix element, $|V_{ub}|$, and can provide new insights into the origin of the long-standing exclusive-inclusive discrepancy in determinations of this Standard-Model parameter. This requires a nonperturbative QCD calculation of the $B \to \rho$ form factors $V$, $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_{12}$. The unstable nature of the $\rho$ resonance has prevented precise lattice QCD calculations of these form factors to date. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the $B \to \rho$ form factors in which the $\rho$ is treated properly as a resonance in $P$-wave $\pi \pi$ scattering. To this end, we use the Lellouch-L\"uscher finite-volume formalism to compute the $B \to \pi \pi$ form factors as a function of both momentum transfer and $\pi \pi$ invariant mass, and then analytically continue to the $\rho$ resonance pole. This calculation is performed with $2+1$ dynamical quark flavors at a pion mass of approximately 320 MeV, and demonstrates a clear path toward results at the physical point.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of charmed hadrons across chiral crossover from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use up to fourth-order charm fluctuations and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations, calculated within the framework of lattice QCD, to study the continuum partial pressure contributions of charmed baryons and mesons. We show that, at and below the chiral crossover temperature, these partial pressures receive enhanced contributions from experimentally unobserved charmed hadrons predicted by the Quark Model. Additionally, we demonstrate that at the chiral crossover, the Hadron Resonance Gas description breaks down, signaling the onset of charm deconfinement. We present evidence for the survival of low-lying non-radial $1S$ and $1P$ hadron-like excitations above the chiral crossover. Finally, we investigate the continuum partial pressure contribution of charm quark-like excitation that emerges at the chiral crossover and calculate its temperature-dependent in-medium mass.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Measurements of the Magnetic Flux Density in Steel Blocks of the Compact Muon Solenoid Magnet Yoke with Solenoid Coil Fast Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN is used to study the production of new particles in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13.6 TeV. The detector includes a magnet based on a 6 m diameter superconducting coil operating at a current of 18.164 kA. This current creates a central magnetic flux density of 3.8 T that allows for the high-precision measurement of the momenta of the produced charged particles using tracking and muon subdetectors. The CMS magnet contains a 10,000 ton flux-return yoke made from the construction steel blocks. These blocks are magnetized, with the coil returned magnetic flux and wrap the muons escaping the hadronic calorimeters. To describe the distribution of the magnetic flux in the magnet yoke layers, a three-dimensional computer model of the CMS magnet is used. To validate the calculations, special measurements are performed, with the flux loops wound in 22 cross-sections of the flux-return yoke blocks. The measured voltages induced in the flux loops during the CMS magnet current variations, are integrated over time to obtain the initial magnetic flux densities in the flux loop cross-sections. In the last time, three fast discharges occurred during the standard ramp-downs of the magnet. This allows us to single out the contributions of the eddy currents, induced in steel, to the flux loop voltages. Accounting for these contributions to the flux loop measurements during intentionally triggered fast discharges in 2006 allows us to perform the validation of the CMS magnet computer model with better precision. The technique for the flux loop measurements and the obtained results are presented and discussed. The method for measuring magnetic flux density in steel blocks described in this study is innovative.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal R(3780)$ Resonance Interpreted as the $1^3D_1$-Wave Dominant State of Charmonium from Precise Measurements of the Cross Section of $e^+e^-\rightarrow$ Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the precise measurements of the cross section of $e^+e^-\rightarrow$ hadrons at center-of-mass energies from 3.645 to 3.871 GeV. We thereby perform the most precise study of the cross sections and find a complex system composed of three resonances of $\mathcal R(3760)$, $\mathcal R(3780)$, and $\mathcal R(3810)$. For the first time, we measure the $\mathcal R(3810)$ electronic width to be $(19.4 \pm 7.4 \pm 12.1)$ eV. For the $\mathcal R(3760)$ resonance, we measure the mass to be $(3751.9\pm 3.8\pm 2.8)$ MeV/$c^2$, the total width to be $(32.8 \pm 5.8 \pm 8.7)$ MeV, and the electronic width to be $(184\pm 75\pm 86)$ eV. For the $\mathcal R(3780)$ resonance, we measure its mass to be $(3778.7\pm 0.5\pm 0.3)$ MeV/$c^2$, total width to be $(20.3 \pm 0.8 \pm 1.7)$ MeV, and electronic width to be $(265\pm 67\pm 83)$ eV. Forty-seven years ago, the $\psi(3770)$ resonance was discovered, and was subsequently interpreted as the $1^3D_1$-wave dominant state of charmonium. However, our analysis of the total-hadron cross sections indicates that the $\psi(3770)$ is not a single state, but a complex system composed of the $\mathcal R(3760)$, $\mathcal R(3780)$, and $\mathcal R(3810)$ resonances. Among these, we interpret the $\mathcal R(3780)$ is a resonance dominated by the $1^3D_1$ charmonium state.</description>

      <title>Model-independent measurement of $D^0$-$\overline{D}{}^0$ mixing parameters in $D^0\rightarrow K^0_{S}\pi^+\pi^-$ decays at Belle and Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a model-independent measurement of the $D^0$-$\overline{D}{}^0$ mixing parameters using samples of $e^+e^-$-collision data collected by the Belle and Belle II experiments that have integrated luminosities of $951\ \text{fb}^{-1}$ and $408\ \text{fb}^{-1}$, respectively. Approximately $2.05\times10^6$ neutral $D$ mesons are reconstructed in the $D^0\rightarrow K^0_{S}\pi^+\pi^-$ channel, with the neutral $D$ flavor tagged by the charge of the pion in the $D^{*+}\rightarrow D^0\pi^+$ decay. Assuming charge-parity symmetry, the mixing parameters are measured to be $ x = (4.0\pm1.7\pm0.4)\times 10^{-3} $ and $ y = (2.9\pm1.4\pm0.3)\times 10^{-3}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. The results are consistent with previous determinations.</description>

      <title>Flavor Physics at CEPC: a General Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the landscape of flavor physics at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), based on the nominal luminosity outlined in its Technical Design Report. The CEPC is designed to operate in multiple modes to address a variety of tasks. At the $Z$ pole, the expected production of 4 Tera $Z$ bosons will provide unique and highly precise measurements of $Z$ boson couplings, while the substantial number of boosted heavy-flavored quarks and leptons produced in clean $Z$ decays will facilitate investigations into their flavor physics with unprecedented precision. We investigate the prospects of measuring various physics benchmarks and discuss their implications for particle theories and phenomenological models. Our studies indicate that, with its highlighted advantages and anticipated excellent detector performance, the CEPC can explore beauty and $\tau$ physics in ways that are superior to or complementary with the Belle II and Large-Hadron-Collider-beauty experiments, potentially enabling the detection of new physics at energy scales of 10 TeV and above. This potential also extends to the observation of yet-to-be-discovered rare and exotic processes, as well as testing fundamental principles such as lepton flavor universality, lepton and baryon number conservation, etc., making the CEPC a vibrant platform for flavor physics research. The $WW$ threshold scan, Higgs-factory operation and top-pair productions of the CEPC further enhance its merits in this regard, especially for measuring the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements, and Flavor-Changing-Neutral-Current physics of Higgs boson and top quarks. We outline the requirements for detector performance and considerations for future development to achieve the anticipated scientific goals.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the hard exclusive $\pi^{0}$ muoproduction cross section at COMPASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new and detailed measurement of the cross section for hard exclusive neutral-pion muoproduction on the proton was performed in a wide kinematic region, with the photon virtuality $Q^2$ ranging from 1 to 8 (GeV/$c$)$^{\rm\, 2}$ and the Bjorken variable $x_{\rm Bj}$ ranging from 0.02 to 0.45. The data were collected at COMPASS at CERN using 160 GeV/$c$ longitudinally polarised $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ beams scattering off a 2.5 m long liquid hydrogen target. From the average of the measured $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ cross sections, the virtual-photon--proton cross section is determined as a function of the squared four-momentum transfer between the initial and final state proton in the range 0.08 (GeV/$c$)$^{\rm\, 2}$ $&lt; |t| &lt;$ 0.64 (GeV/$c$)$^{\rm\, 2}$. From its angular distribution, the combined contribution of transversely and longitudinally polarised photons are determined, as well as transverse--transverse and longitudinal--transverse interference contributions. They are studied as functions of four-momentum transfer $|t|$, photon virtuality $Q^2$ and virtual-photon energy $\nu$. The longitudinal--transverse interference contribution is found to be compatible with zero. The significant transverse--transverse interference contribution reveals the existence of a dominant contribution by transversely polarized photons. This provides clear experimental evidence for the chiral-odd GPD $\overline{E}_T$. In addition, the existence of a non-negligible contribution of longitudinally polarized photons is suggested by the $|t|$-dependence of the cross section at $x_{\rm Bj} &lt; $ 0.1 . Altogether, these results provide valuable input for future modelling of GPDs and thus of cross sections for exclusive pseudo-scalar meson production. Furthermore, they can be expected to facilitate the study of next-to-leading order corrections and higher-twist contributions.</description>

      <title>Large lepton number violation at colliders: predictions from the minimal linear seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small neutrino masses can be sourced by a tiny vacuum expectation value of a leptophilic Higgs doublet, and mediated by Quasi-Dirac heavy neutrinos. In such simplest linear seesaw picture the neutrino mass mediators can be accessible to colliders. We describe novel charged Higgs and heavy neutrino production mechanisms that can be sizeable at $e^+ e^-$, $e^- \gamma$, $pp$, or muon colliders and discuss some of the associated signatures. The oscillation length of the heavy neutrino mediators is directly related to the light neutrino mass ordering. Moreover, lepton number violation can be large despite the smallness of neutrino masses, and may shed light on the Majorana nature of neutrinos and the significance of basic symmetries in weak interaction.</description>

      <title>Testing the light scalar meson as a non-$q\bar q$ state in semileptonic $D$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the light scalar mesons ($S_0$) are considered to be either ordinary $q\bar q$ or exotic tetraquark states, we investigate the semileptonic decays $D\to S_0 e^+\nu_e$, by taking into account the resonant effects of $S_0\to M_1 M_2$, where $S_0=a_0(980)$, $f_0(980)$, and $f_0(500)/\sigma_0$, and $M_{1(2)}$ represents a pseudoscalar meson. For the first time, the $D\to S_0$ form factors in the two quark structures are both presented. Subsequently, we calculate ${\cal B}(D_s^+\to \sigma_0 e^+\nu_e,\sigma_0\to\pi^+\pi^-)=(20.3\pm 1.8\pm 0.5)\times 10^{-4}$ in the $q\bar q$ structure, showing significant $9\sigma$ deviations from the experimental upper limit of $3.3\times 10^{-4}$. In contrast, ${\cal B}(D_s^+\to \sigma_0 e^+\nu_e,\sigma_0\to\pi^+\pi^-)=(0.58^{+1.43}_{-0.57}\pm 0.01)\times 10^{-4}$ in the $q^2\bar q^2$ structure is within the allowed experimental range. Clearly, the light scalar meson is tested as a non-$q\bar q$ state. We hence demonstrate a highly sensitive new approach for exploring the true nature of scalar mesons, which can be extended to non-leptonic $D$ decays as well as $B$ meson decays.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order QCD Corrections to Polarized Semi-Inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) is a key process in the quest for a resolution of the proton spin puzzle. We present the complete results for the polarized SIDIS process at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Our analytical results include all partonic channels for the scattering of polarized leptons off hadrons and a spin-averaged hadron identified in the final state. A numerical analysis of the NNLO corrections illustrates their significance and the reduced residual scale dependence in the kinematic range probed by the future Electron-Ion-Collider EIC.</description>

      <title>Electric field induction in quark-gluon plasma due to thermoelectric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is locally thermalized. Due to electrically charged particles (quarks), QGP exhibits interesting thermoelectric phenomena during its evolution, resulting in an electromagnetic (EM) field in the medium. In this study, for the first time, we estimate the induced electric field in QGP due to the thermoelectric effect. This phenomenon can induce an EM field even in QGP produced by the head-on heavy-ion collision. In peripheral heavy-ion collisions, the presence of a spectator current generates a transient magnetic field at the early stage, which disrupts the isotropy of the induced electric field. For the numerical estimation, we use a quasiparticle-based model that incorporates the lattice quantum chromodynamics equation of state for QGP. The induced electric field is estimated with cooling rates derived from Gubser hydrodynamic flow. Thermoelectric coefficients such as Seebeck, magneto-Seebeck, and Nernst coefficients play a crucial role in determining the induced field. Additionally, we account for the temperature evolution of QGP using different hydrodynamic cooling rates to calculate the transport coefficients. We also estimate the transport coefficients and the induced electric field in the presence of an external time-varying magnetic field, including the quantum effect of Landau quantization, and explore the effects of the intensity and decay parameter of the magnetic field on the induced electric field. Our findings reveal that the space-time profile of the induced electric field is zero at the center and increases as we go away from the center. During the early stages of evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of $eE \approx 1~m_\pi^2$, decreasing in strength over time.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Nonstandard Interactions and Lepton Flavor Universality violation at SND@LHC via charm production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the effect of neutrino nonstandard interactions (NSI) involving the charm quark at SND@LHC. Using an effective description of new physics in terms of four-fermion operators involving a charm quark, we constrain the Wilson coefficients of the effective interaction from two and three-body charmed meson decays. In our fit, we include charmed meson decays not only to pseudoscalar final states but also to vector final states and include decays to the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ final states. We also consider constraints from charmed baryon decays. We then study the effect of new physics in neutrino scattering processes, involving charm production at SND@LHC, for various benchmark new physics couplings obtained from the low energy fits. Finally, we also study the effects of lepton universality violation (LUV) assuming that the new physics coupling is not lepton universal.</description>

      <title>What we can learn from the angular differential rates (only) in semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple approach to the study of semileptonic $B \to D^* \ell \nu_\ell$ decays based on the angular distributions of the final state particles only. Our approach is model independent and never requires the knowledge of $\vert V_{cb} \vert$. By studying such distributions in the case of light leptons, a comparison between results from different data sets from the Belle and BelleII Collaborations and between data and Standard Model calculations is also given for several interesting quantities. A good consistency is observed between some of the experimental results and the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Confronting the seesaw mechanism with neutrino oscillations: a general and explicit analytical bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the flavor structure for the canonical seesaw mechanism, we present the first general and explicit analytical calculations of the two neutrino mass-squared differences, three flavor mixing angles and the effective Dirac CP-violating phase responsible for the primary behaviors of neutrino oscillations. Such model-independent results will pave the way for testing the seesaw mechanism at low energies.</description>
