      <title>Efficiency of Hydrodynamic Atmospheric Escape in Hot Jupiters and Super Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a flexible one-dimensional code to model the escape of hydrogen and helium from a hot Jupiter as a result of photoionization from extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. We include stellar spectrum heating and ionization, radiative cooling by Lyman-$\alpha$ and H$_3^+$, heat conduction, tidal gravity, a H-He reaction network, and account for the secondary ionization of species by photoelectrons. For a fiducial hot Jupiter, we uncover a three-layer structure: an H$_3^+$-cooled layer of molecular hydrogen at the base, enveloped by a Lyman-$\alpha$-cooled layer of neutral hydrogen, which transitions into an ionized wind layer that is cooled by adiabatic expansion. The highest spectral energy photons are deposited in the molecular layer, where, after accounting for energy loss via photoelectrons and ionization, H$_3^+$ is a substantial radiative coolant. We run a grid of models, varying the distance of our fiducial planet from the star. We find that heat conduction at the base starts to have an effect at distances $\gtrsim 0.2$ au, increasing the H$_3^+$ cooling relative to the EUV input flux. At increasing stellocentric distances, the outflow becomes increasingly more neutral. The neutral hydrogen starts to decouple from the ionized outflow, free-streaming out. In pure H-He mini-Neptune/super-Earth simulations, the outflows are significantly cooler, allowing molecules to survive throughout the outflow, pointing toward the likely importance of molecular cooling in determining whether these planets can maintain massive atmospheres. The analysis in this paper provides a framework for understanding the impact of molecular radiative cooling on atmospheric outflows.</description>

      <title>Numerical Determination of the Gravitational Cross Sections of an Accreting Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant amount of work has been devoted to the study of small binary solar system objects. The majority of these binaries, especially among the near-earth or main belt asteroids have small radius ratios, implying a large difference in size between the primary and its companion. Farther from the sun, the binary fraction increases, with the Kuiper Belt having many known binaries with radius ratios of order unity. In this paper, we consider the runaway growth of a binary system in an accretionary stream of small particles. We perform brute-force integrations, each with 10 million test particles and numerically compute the gravitational cross sections for each member of the binary as a function of the system's separation and mass ratio. We show that the behavior of the cross section is complex, and it can be either diminished or enhanced depending on the orbital configuration. In the regime where gravitational focusing dominates the accretion process, we show that binaries grow towards smaller mass ratios than would be expected given single-body cross sections. Finally, we provide a grid of these cross sections for use in the future study of such systems.</description>

      <title>Methane on the temperate exo-Saturn TOI-199b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperate ($T_{\rm eq}&lt;400$ K) gas giants represent an unexplored frontier in exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy. Orbiting a G-type star every ~100 days, the Saturn-mass exoplanet TOI-199 b ($T_{\rm eq}=350$ K) is one of the most favorable low-temperature gas giants for atmospheric study. Here, we present its transmission spectrum from a single transit observed with JWST's NIRSpec G395M mode. Despite lower-than-nominal precision due to a pointing misalignment, Bayesian retrievals reveal the presence of CH$_4$ (Bayes factor of $\sim$700 in a cloudy atmosphere), corresponding to a metallicity of $\rm{C/H}=13^{+78}_{-12}\times$ solar, although the absence of detectable CO and CO$_2$ disfavors metallicities $\gtrsim50\times$ solar. We also tested several haze prescriptions (Titan-like tholin, soot, and water-rich tholin), but the preference for these models is weak (Bayes factors of $\sim 2$ relative to the clear case). The spectrum also shows an increase in transit depth near 3 $\mu$m, which our self-consistent models attribute to either NH$_3$ or, less likely, HCN. Follow-up observations will distinguish between these species, helping determine the planet's vertical mixing regime. The TOI-199 system exhibits strong transit timing variations (TTVs) due to an outer non-transiting giant planet. For planet c, our TTV analysis reduces its mass uncertainty by 50% and prefers a slightly longer orbital period (still within the conservative habitable zone) and higher eccentricity relative to previous studies. TOI-199 b serves as the first data point for studying clouds and hazes in temperate gas giants. The detection of methane supports the emerging trend that temperate low-molecular-weight atmospheres display spectral features in transmission.</description>

      <title>Helium Depletion in Escaping Atmospheres of Sub-Neptunes: A Signature of Primary-to-Secondary Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-period sub-Neptunes are common in extrasolar systems. These sub-Neptunes are generally thought to have primary atmospheres of protoplanetary-disk gas origin. However, atmospheric escape followed by degassing from their interiors can lead to the transition to secondary atmospheres depleted in gases less-soluble to magma, such as helium. These primary and secondary atmospheres can potentially be distinguished from observations of escaping hydrogen and helium. This study aims to elucidate the impact of the primary-secondary transition on atmospheric compositions of short-period sub-Neptunes. We simulate their evolution with atmospheric escape driven by stellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet irradiation and degassing of hydrogen, helium, and water from their rocky interiors, with a one-dimensional structure model. We show that the transition takes place for low-mass, close-in planets which experience extensive atmospheric escape. These planets show the depletion of helium and enrichment of water in their atmospheres, because of their low and high abundances in the planetary interiors, respectively. A compilation of our parameter survey (the orbital period, planetary mass, envelope mass, and mantle FeO content) shows a correlation between the planet radius and the helium escape rate. We suggest that the transition from primary to secondary atmospheres may serve an explanation for helium non-detection for relatively-small ($\lesssim 2.5\ R_\oplus$) exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solutions for Planet-Scattering Small Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational scattering of small bodies (planetesimals) by a planet remains a fundamental problem in celestial mechanics. It is traditionally modeled within the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where individual particle trajectories are obtained via numerical integrations. Here, we introduce a patched-conic framework to describe the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle's orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\mathbf{U}_\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet's orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets).</description>

      <title>Coupled atmospHere Interior modeL Intercomparison (CHILI) Protocol Version 1.0: A CUISINES Intercomparison Project of Magma Ocean Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic characterization of rocky exoplanets with the James Webb Space Telescope has brought the origin and evolution of their atmospheres into the focus of exoplanet science. Time-evolved models of the feedback between interior and atmosphere are critical to predict and interpret these observations and link them to the Solar System terrestrial planets. However, models differ in methodologies and input data, which can lead to significant differences in interpretation. In this paper, we present the experimental protocol of the Coupled atmospHere Interior modeL Intercomparison (CHILI) project. CHILI is an (exo-)planet model intercomparison project within the Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies (CUISINES) framework, which aims to support a diverse set of multi-model intercomparison projects in the exoplanet community. The present protocol includes the initial set of participating magma ocean models, divided into evolutionary and static models, and two types of test categories, one focused on Solar System planets (Earth &amp; Venus) and the other on exoplanets orbiting low-mass M-dwarfs. Both test categories aim to quantify the evolution of key markers of the links between planetary atmospheres and interiors over geological timescales. The proposed tests would allow us to quantify and compare the differences between coupled atmosphere-interior models used by the exoplanet and planetary science communities. Results from the proposed tests will be published in dedicated follow-up papers. To encourage the community to join this comparison effort and as an example, we present initial test results for the early Earth and TRAPPIST-1 b, conducted with models differing in the treatment of energy transport in the planetary interior and atmosphere, surface boundary layer, geochemistry, and the in- and outgassing of volatile compounds.</description>

      <title>Asteroid phase curve modeling with empirical correction for shape and viewing geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel empirical method for correcting asteroid phase curves for rotational and geometrical effects using precomputed spin-and-shape models. Our approach normalizes sparse photometric data to a pole-on geometry, enabling consistent phase-curve fitting across apparitions. We fit both the H,G1,G2 and H,G12 phase functions to the normalized data. We also numerically derive new constraints on parameter ranges that ensure physically meaningful solutions. These constraints are based on the requirement that the reduced magnitude must monotonically decrease with phase angle and remain within plausible slope bounds. Compared to earlier bounds, our new constraints are more permissive. We also compare derivative-based and derivative-free optimization methods, highlighting convergence issues with the HG12 function and offering mitigation strategies. We applied our method to over 25,000 asteroids observed by the ATLAS survey, demonstrating its usability. The new method enables the selection of the preferred spin-and-shape solution based on either statistical phase-curve model selection criteria and/or physically motivated constraints on the phase-curve shape.</description>

      <title>Dynamical simulation of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT by NASA Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), with a v$_{\infty}$ $\sim$ 58 kms$^{-1}$. This is the fastest among the three interstellar objects discovered so far. In this work, we study the interaction of the 3I/ATLAS with Mars, pre-perihelion, and Jupiter post-perihelion. We also present the results of the dynamical simulations of the orbital evolution of the comet for a hundred years in the past and future. For our analysis, we have used REBOUND, an N-Body simulation package, to study these situations. We use the adaptive size mathematical integrator \textsc{Ias15}, with a 1-day time step for long-term integration, and a 1-hour time step to study the effect of the planets on this body during the close encounters. We have seen an effect of Jupiter on the orbital parameters of the comet, which affects its post-perijove trajectory significantly. The impact of Mars on this comet is minimal compared to the effect of Jupiter. This is consistent with the point that the comet moves well past Mars's Hill radius but very close to Jupiter's Hill radius at the respective close approaches. However, the effect of non-gravitational forces will alter the results. Since the non-gravitational forces are not yet known, we predict the variation of the orbital parameters considering a range of possible magnitudes of the non-gravitational acceleration.</description>

      <title>An observationally based wind model contemporaneous with the radio detections in $\tau$ Bo\"otis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent low-frequency array (LOFAR) radio signal detections bearing from the $\tau$ Bo\"otis system have been cautiously attributed to auroral emissions from the hot Jupiter $\tau$ Bo\"otis Ab. The auroral emissions are believed to be excited by interaction between the exoplanet and the winds of its host star. Since stellar winds respond to stellar surface magnetism, three-dimensional stellar wind modelling, able to account for the star's contemporaneous magnetic field geometry, can aid the interpretation of radio detections. For the first time, we present spectropolarimetric observations of $\tau$ Bo\"otis A from the same epoch as the LOFAR detections. We derive a contemporaneous large-scale magnetic map of $\tau$ Bo\"otis A, which shows a poloidally dominated field with mean strength 1.6 G. From our magnetic map, we create a three-dimensional numerical wind model and characterise the wind properties around $\tau$ Bo\"otis Ab. To compute the wind power dissipated in $\tau$ Bo\"otis Ab's magnetosphere, we apply two approaches: A) the solar system-based empirical relation called Bode's law; and B) a resolved numerical model of the planetary magnetosphere. When consistently applying best-case assumptions, we redict radio flux densities around 50 mJy and 0.68 mJy respectively. Our values are much too small to be consistent with the reported observation of $890_{-500}^{+690}$ mJy; a stellar surface magnetic field scaling $\gtrsim 10$ is required to reproduce the observed signal strength. As $\tau$ Bo\"otis A has a rapid magnetic cycle, we speculate that wind variations cased by variation in stellar magnetism may explain the lack of detections from follow-up observations. Our work emphasises the importance of contemporaneous observations of stellar magnetism and observational signatures of star-planet interaction.</description>

      <title>Grain growth in protoplanetary disks in the Upper Scorpius revealed by millimeter-wave spectral indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of dust size from millimeter-wavelength spectra provides direct constraints on grain growth in protoplanetary disks. The spectral indices between 0.88 mm and 2.9 mm have been measured in multiple young star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Ophiuchus, and Lupus, which have ages of 1-3 Myr. These spectral indices are as low as 2-3, suggesting that grains in disks are much larger than those in the interstellar medium. In this study, we analyze the ALMA archival data of 23 disks in the Upper Scorpius region. The observed wavelength is 2.9 mm in Band 3, the angular resolution is 3.3 arcsec x 2.1 arcsec, which is not high enough to resolve the targets, and the rms noise is below 0.075 mJy beam$^{-1}$ for almost all sources. Together with the literature values of the Band 7 fluxes of the same targets, we find that the average spectral index of the disks in the Upper Scorpius region is $\alpha_\mathrm{mm}=2.09 \pm 0.10$, which is equal to or slightly smaller than those at the other younger regions. To explain the relationship between the fluxes and spectral indices of the disks in the Taurus, Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Upper Scorpius regions, we construct simple disk evolution models. The observations are best reproduced by models in which the inner radius of the disk increases. This suggests that a substantial amount of dust mass must persist in the outer disk regions where the dust temperature is lower than 20 K even at late evolutionary stages. These findings offer key insights into the grain growth and the temporal evolution of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Searching for primitive, dark, spectrally red asteroid families in the main belt with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark asteroids with featureless neutral to red spectra are of particular interest due to their ability to potentially harbour primitive, hydrated, and possibly organic-rich material. These asteroids belong to the spectroscopic C-complex, to the X-types with low geometric visible albedo values as well as to the T- and D-type end members of the Bus-DeMeo spectroscopic taxonomy. Here we used Gaia Data Release 3 visible reflectance spectra to study the average spectral profiles of the C- and X-complex asteroid families in the central and outer main belt (orbital semi-major axis between 2.5 - 3.7~au). We found that eight of these families, namely 96 Aegle, 627 Charis, 1484 Postrema and 5438 Lorre, previously classified as C-complex families, and 322 Phaeo, 1303 Luthera, 5567 Durisen and 53546 2000BY6 previously classified as X-complex families, have redder slopes than implied by their previous classification and could be better classified as T-/D-type families. Some of these families may also feed the near-Earth asteroid population, being responsible for the observed T-/D-type excess. However, the analysis of their principal components of Gaia Data Release 3 spectra suggest that further near-infrared observations are needed in order to verify this identification.</description>

      <title>A homogeneous TTV investigation of all TESS systems with a confirmed single transiting planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) are a powerful tool for detecting unseen companions in systems with known transiting exoplanets and for characterizing their masses and orbital properties. Large-scale and homogeneous TTV analyses are a valuable method to complement the demographics of planetary systems and understand the role of dynamical interactions. We present the results of a systematic TTV analysis of 423 systems covering 16000 transits, each with a single transiting planet first discovered by the TESS mission and afterwards confirmed or validated. The primary aim of this survey is to identify the most promising candidates for dynamically active systems that warrant further investigation. In the first stage of our analysis, precise measurements of the transit times are extracted for each system in an homogeneous way. In the second stage, we apply a decision framework to classify candidates by analyzing the resulting variations. Based on excess timing scatter and the difference in Bayesian Information Criterion of periodic models over linear ones, the TTVs are classified as significant, marginal, or non-detections. We find 11 systems with significant TTVs, 5 of which were announced in previous works, and 10 more systems with marginal evidence in our sample. We present 3-panel diagnostic plots for all the candidates, showing phase-folded light curves, the transit variations over time, and the variations folded on the recovered TTV period. A comprehensive summary table detailing the fitted parameters and TTV significance for the entire survey is also provided. This survey constitutes the largest homogeneous TTV analysis of TESS systems to date. We provide the community with updated ephemerides and a catalogue of high-quality TTV candidates, enabling targeted follow-up observations and dynamical modelling to uncover the nature of unseen companions and study system architectures.</description>

      <title>Disc fragmentation. I. Ejection of Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 25 years, observations have uncovered a large population of free-floating planets (FFPs), whose origins remain debated. Massive FFPs (several Jupiter masses or more) may form via gravitational collapse of molecular clouds, similar to stars. Lower-mass FFPs likely originate in planetary systems and are later ejected through dynamical interactions. We show that disc fragmentation in very young stellar binaries may be an abundant source of Jupiter-like FFPs (JFFPs), with masses above 0.3 Jupiter masses. In our model, disc fragmentation at tens to 100 au from the primary star produces gas giants, while fragmentation further out forms a more massive object that will eventually evolve into the secondary star. We present 3D simulations of massive, self-gravitating discs with embedded Jupiter-mass planets and a secondary seed ($5-50 M_J$). Chaotic migration leads to frequent planet-secondary interactions, imparting velocity kicks via gravitational slingshot that usually end in planet ejection. The ejection fraction increases steeply with the secondary-to-primary mass ratio, $q_s$, reaching 0.6 for $q_s &gt; 0.05$. Compared to Core Accretion JFFPs, disc fragmentation JFFPs: (i) form earlier, and may be more abundant in young clusters; (ii) are ejected at much lower velocities; (iii) may retain compact circum-planetary discs. To reproduce the observed abundance of JFFPs, disc fragmentation planets must be in the post-collapse configuration. They must also either form more frequently in binary systems than around single stars, or be frequently disrupted in inner disc regions, as previously suggested in certain versions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: A Machine Learning Ready Dataset for Ionospheric Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.</description>

      <title>Thermal equilibrium curves of accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogous to the HR diagram for stars, the thermal equilibrium curve encodes the thermodynamics of accretion disks by expressing the local balance between heating -- primarily via viscous dissipation -- and cooling -- typically through radiative transfer. These curves are commonly plotted as surface density versus effective temperature. When an S-shaped locus appears, local annuli become bistable, and limit-cycle oscillations arise when the external mass-transfer rate falls within an unstable band. This behavior underpins the disk instability model for recurring outbursts in cataclysmic variables. This paper reviews first-principles thermal equilibrium curves for accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI), with emphasis on dwarf novae. Unlike the parameterized $\alpha$-viscosity approach, the curves are obtained by solving the governing equations with radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations, thereby reproducing S-shaped loci without prescribing $\alpha$. The disk instability in dwarf-nova systems and the physical origin of angular-momentum transport (shear stresses) are also briefly reviewed. Notes on the stability of radiation-dominated accretion flows are included in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Inertial Modes in 3D Simulations of Rotating Convection in Planets and Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal convection in rotating stars and planets drives anisotropic turbulence and strong differential rotation, both capable of feeding energy into global oscillations. Using 3D simulations of rotating convection in spherical shells, we show that inertial modes--oscillations restored by the Coriolis force--emerge naturally in rotationally constrained turbulence, without imposing any external forcing. By varying the rotation rate at fixed thermal forcing, we find that coherent modes appear only when the convective Rossby number, the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time, falls below about one-half, where rotation dominates the dynamics. These modes are mostly retrograde in the rotating frame, equatorially symmetric, and confined to mid and high latitudes, with discrete frequencies well below twice the rotation rate. At lower viscosities, or smaller Prandtl number, mode excitation becomes more efficient and a broader spectrum of inertial modes emerges. While the precise excitation mechanism remains uncertain, our results suggest that the modes are driven by shear instabilities rather than stochastic forcing by convection. We conclude that similar inertial modes are likely to exist in the interiors of giant planets and stars, though their low frequencies will make them difficult to detect.</description>

      <title>Planetary dynamos driven by semiconvection in stably stratified layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stably stratified fluid layers are common in gaseous planets, stellar interiors, and planetary cores, and have long been considered incapable of sustaining dynamo action. Here, we show that semiconvection - driven by a destabilizing thermal gradient within an overall stably stratified medium - can, in fact, give rise to self-sustained magnetic fields. Motivated by recent models suggesting that large portions of Jupiter and Saturn may be semiconvective, we perform direct numerical simulations in spherical shells, operating in the planetary-relevant regime of low magnetic Prandtl numbers. From a primary semiconvection instability, a layered convection state spontaneously develops, consisting of a convective region beneath a stably stratified layer of comparable thickness. Fluid motions in this convective region are strong enough to produce magnetic fields with key features observed in planetary dynamos, including strong dipolarity, realistic field strengths, and spectral characteristics. These results provide the first direct evidence that semiconvection can drive dynamo action in stably stratified regions of gas giants and stellar interiors, with important implications for understanding astrophysical magnetic field generation.</description>

      <title>Dust Recycling and Icy Volatile Enhancement (DRIVE): A Novel Method of Volatile Enrichment in Cold Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant planet atmospheres are thought to reflect the gas phase composition of the disk when and where they formed. However, these atmospheres may also be polluted via solid accretion or ice sublimation in the disk. Here, we propose a novel mechanism for enriching the atmospheres of these giant planets with volatiles via pebble drift, fragmentation, and ice sublimation. We use a combination of 3D hydrodynamic simulations, radiative transfer, and particle tracking to follow the trajectories and resulting temperatures of solids in a disk containing an embedded planet forming outside the CO snowline. We show that small dust can become entrained in the meridional flows created by the giant planet and advected above the disk midplane where temperatures are well above the sublimation temperature of CO. This transport of small grains occurs over 10 kyr timescales, with individual micron-sized grains cycling between the midplane and surface of the disk multiple times throughout the planetary accretion stage. We find that this stirring of dust results in sublimation of CO gas above the snow surface in the dust trap created exterior to the giant planet, leading to super-solar CO abundances in the pressure bump. This mechanism of Dust Recycling and Icy Volatile Enhancement in cold giant planets, which we call the DRIVE effect, may explain enhanced metallicities of both wide separation exoplanets as well as Jupiter in our own Solar System.</description>

      <title>Indirect forces in disc-planet interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational coupling between a protoplanetary disc and an embedded planet is often studied in a frame attached to a central star. This frame is non-inertial because of the stellar reflex motion, leading to indirect forces arising in the star-planet-disc system. Here we examine the impact produced by these forces on several aspects of disc-planet coupling using analytical and numerical means. We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.</description>

      <title>Shaping the Mantle: The Role of Superheated Cores After Giant Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</description>
