      <title>Emergence of social hierarchies in a society with two competitive classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models describing social interactions among individuals can help to better understand emerging macroscopic patterns in societies. One of the topics which is worth tackling is the formation of different kinds of hierarchies that emerge in social spaces such as cities. Here we propose a Bonabeau-like model by adding a second class of agents. The fundamental particularity of our model is that only a pairwise interaction between agents of the opposite class is allowed. Agent fitness can thus only change by competition among the two classes, while the total fitness in the society remains constant. The main result is that for a broad range of values of the model parameters, the fitness of the agents of each class show a decay in time except for one or very few agents which capture almost all the fitness in the society. Numerical simulations also reveal a singular shift from egalitarian to hierarchical society for each class. This behaviour depends on the control parameter $\eta$, playing the role of the inverse of the temperature of the system. Results are invariant with regard to the system size, contingent solely on the quantity of agents within each class. Finally, a couple of scaling laws are provided thus showing a data collapse from different model parameters and they follow a shape which can be related to the presence of a phase transition in the model.</description>

      <title>Lift-and-Project Integrality Gaps for Santa Claus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the MaxMinDegree Arborescence (MMDA) problem in layered directed graphs of depth $\ell\le O(\log n/\log \log n)$, which is a special case of the Santa Claus problem. Obtaining a poly-logarithmic approximation for MMDA in polynomial time is of high interest as it is the main obstacle towards the same guarantee for the general Santa Claus problem, which is itself a necessary condition to eventually improve the long-standing 2-approximation for makespan scheduling on unrelated machines by Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos [FOCS'87]. The only ways we have to solve the MMDA problem within an $O(\text{polylog}(n))$ factor is via a ``round-and-condition'' algorithm using the $(\ell-1)^{th}$ level of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, or via a ``recursive greedy'' algorithm which also has quasi-polynomial time. However, very little is known about the limitations of these techniques, and it is even plausible that the round-and-condition algorithm could obtain the same approximation guarantee with only $1$ round of Sherali-Adams, which would imply a polynomial-time algorithm. As a main result, we construct an MMDA instance of depth $3$ for which an integrality gap of $n^{\Omega(1)}$ survives $1$ round of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. This result is best possible since it is known that after only $2$ rounds the gap is at most poly-logarithmic on depth-3 graphs. Second, we show that our instance can be ``lifted'' via a simple trick to MMDA instances of any depth $\ell\in \Omega(1)\cap o(\log n/\log \log n)$, for which we conjecture that an integrality gap of $n^{\Omega(1/\ell)}$ survives $\Omega(\ell)$ rounds of Sherali-Adams. We show a number of intermediate results towards this conjecture, which also suggest that our construction is a significant challenge to the techniques used so far for Santa Claus.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Vertex Deletion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertex deletion problems for graphs are studied intensely in classical and parameterized complexity theory. They ask whether we can delete at most k vertices from an input graph such that the resulting graph has a certain property. Regarding k as the parameter, a dichotomy was recently shown based on the number of quantifier alternations of first-order formulas that describe the property. In this paper, we refine this classification by moving from quantifier alternations to individual quantifier patterns and from a dichotomy to a trichotomy, resulting in a complete classification of the complexity of vertex deletion problems based on their quantifier pattern. The more fine-grained approach uncovers new tractable fragments, which we show to not only lie in FPT, but even in parameterized constant-depth circuit complexity classes. On the other hand, we show that vertex deletion becomes intractable already for just one quantifier per alternation, that is, there is a formula of the form {\forall}x{\exists}y{\forall}z({\psi}), with {\psi} quantifier-free, for which the vertex deletion problem is W[1]-hard. The fine-grained analysis also allows us to uncover differences in the complexity landscape when we consider different kinds of graphs and more general structures: While basic graphs (undirected graphs without self-loops), undirected graphs, and directed graphs each have a different frontier of tractability, the frontier for arbitrary logical structures coincides with that of directed graphs.</description>

      <title>On Kolmogorov Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All strings with low mutual information with the halting sequence will have flat Kolmogorov Structure Functions, in the context of Algorithmic Statistics. Assuming the Independence Postulate, strings with non-negligible information with the halting sequence are purely mathematical constructions, and cannot be found in nature. Thus Algorithmic Statistics does not study strings in the physical world. This leads to the general thesis that two part codes require limitations as shown in the Minimum Description Length Principle. We also discuss issues with set-restricted Kolmogorov Structure Functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lower Bounds by Sample-to-Query Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polynomial method by Beals, Buhrman, Cleve, Mosca, and de Wolf (FOCS 1998) and the adversary method by Ambainis (STOC 2000) have been shown to be powerful in proving quantum query lower bounds for a wide variety of problems. In this paper, we propose an arguably new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results:
  1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination.
  2. A matching lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal.
  3. A new lower bound $\widetilde \Omega(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023).
  4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015).
  In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.</description>
