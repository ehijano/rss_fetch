      <title>Beyond $\Lambda$CDM: Exploring a Dynamical Cosmological Constant Framework Consistent with Late-Time Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a cosmological scenario with a time-dependent cosmological constant $\Lambda$(t) within the spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework. Here we study a power-law $\Lambda(t)$CDM model characterized by a dynamic cosmological constant expressed as a function of the Hubble parameter and its derivative $\Lambda(t)$ $=\alpha (\dot H+H^{2})+\lambda H^2+4\pi G\rho\eta.$ Using recent observational datasets (DESI BAO, OHD, and PP\&amp;SH0ES), we constrain the model's free parameters $(H_{0},\alpha,\lambda,\eta)$ and analyze their impact on key cosmological quantities. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of the best-fit value of $H_{0}=71.9\pm 0.23$ km/s/Mpc from PP\&amp;SH0ES analysis only, which substantially alleviates the existing tension between early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant, reducing it to $\sim1.5\sigma$. The reconstructed $Om$ diagnostic exhibits a negative slope, indicating a dynamic dark energy behavior with quintessence-like characteristics ($\omega&gt;-1$). These results suggest that the proposed $\Lambda(t)$ model provides a viable alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm to explain the late-time acceleration of the universe. Our findings show that this model alleviates the Hubble tension more effectively than the standard $\Lambda$CDM . The model also demonstrates compatibility with late-time Hubble parameter observations and offers a compelling framework to address the limitations of $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Some New Types of Well-Behaved Polynomial Redshift Parametrization of Dark Energy Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a new type of smooth and well-behaved polynomial redshift function that can avoid a future singularity. Using this function, we have proposed different redshift parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state, drawing motivation from different polynomial functions like conventional polynomial, Legendre polynomial, Laguerre polynomial, Chebyshev polynomial and Fibonacci polynomial. The main feature of these parametrizations is their well-behaved nature throughout the evolution of the universe, which was a matter of concern in most of the previous polynomial parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS). This form of parametrization may be considered as an extension of those forms with no divergence at any redshift value. A comprehensive observational data analysis is performed with the Hubble, BAO and DESI datasets to constrain the parameter space of the models. Confidence contours showing joint and marginalized posterior distribution with different combinations of datasets are generated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We see that our improved parametrizations enable us to derive more stringent restrictions on the current dark energy EoS and its derivative, which improves performance. Finally, a machine learning analysis is performed using some suitable algorithms like ELR, PILR, ANN, SVR, ERFR and GBR to compare the models. Among all the tested polynomial bases, the Legendre basis demonstrated superior performance with the lowest test RMSE and reduced $\chi^{2}$ value under the Modified Differential Evolution theoretical model, indicating exceptional physical accuracy and numerical stability.</description>

      <title>On de Sitter Space, Scalar Fields and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An introductory, self-contained overview with pedagogical figures is provided to acquaint readers unfamiliar with the subject with key aspects of de Sitter space and inflation. The connection between de Sitter space and cosmology is reviewed. The embedding of a hyperboloid surface in higher-dimensional Minkowski space is analysed, and the Killing vectors of de Sitter space are derived in both global and planar coordinate systems; their integral curves are visualised on the de Sitter Penrose diagram, illustrating the static patches and cosmological horizons. The inflaton scalar field is quantised in the Bunch-Davies vacuum within the slow-roll regime. The two- and three-point correlation functions are computed using the ADM decomposition and the in-in formalism. These computations are related to the observed small temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Letelier-AdS Black Hole Surrounded by a Perfect Fluid Dark Matter in the presence of Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter black hole coupled to a cloud of strings featuring only the electric-like component of the string bivector, embedded in a perfect fluid dark matter and a quintessence field. We examine the dynamics of photons and massive particles, focusing on trajectories, photon spheres, BH shadows, their topological characteristics, and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), and emphasizing the influence of string cloud, perfect-fluid dark matter, and quintessence-like field parameters. Additionally, we explore the black hole's thermodynamics, deriving the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat, and discuss the modified first law of thermodynamics and thermodynamic topology under external matter fields. We demonstrate that the presence of a string cloud, perfect-fluid dark matter, and a quintessence-like field together modifies the geodesic structure and thermodynamic properties, thereby shifting the results relative to the standard Schwarzschild BH solution.</description>

      <title>A Quasigroup Approach for Conservation Laws in Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the quasigroup approach to conservation laws in general relativity, we show how the infinite-parametric Newman-Unti group of asymptotic symmetries can be reduced to the Poincare quasigroup. We compute Noether's charges associated with any element of the Poincare quasialgebra. The integral conserved quantities of energy momentum and angular momentum, being linear on generators of the Poincare quasigroup, are identically equal to zero in Minkowski spacetime. We present a definition of the angular momentum free of the supertranslation ambiguity. We provide an appropriate notion of intrinsic angular momentum and a description of the mass reference frame's center at future null infinity. Finally, in the center of mass reference frame, the momentum and angular momentum are defined by the Komar expression.</description>

      <title>Inferring neutron-star Love-Q relations from gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the large uncertainties in the equation of state for neutron stars (NSs), a tight universal ``Love-Q'' relation exists between their dimensionless tidal deformability, $\Lambda$, and the dimensionless quadrupole moment, $Q$. However, this relation has not yet been directly measured through observations. Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary NS (BNS) coalescences provide an avenue for such a measurement. In this study, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian framework and combine multiple simulated GW events to measure the Love-Q relation. We simulate 1000 GW sources and select 20 events with the highest signal-to-noise ratios and NS spins for the analysis. By inspecting four parameterization models of the Love-Q relation, we observe strong correlations between the model parameters. We verify that a linear relation between $\ln\Lambda$ and $\ln Q$ is practically sufficient to describe the Love-Q relation with the precision expected from next-generation GW detectors. Furthermore, we utilize the inferred Love-Q relation to test modified gravity. Taking the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an example, our results suggest that the characteristic length can be constrained to $10\, \mathrm{km}$ or less with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Memories of Gravitational Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational shockwaves produce perturbations of field systems. We study classical scalar and electromagnetic fields and gravitational memory effects left after the action on the fields of plane-fronted gravitational shockwaves. The gravitational memory plays a key role for the choice of Cauchy data which determine the perturbations. We demonstrate that field systems`remember' only a spatial `profile' of the shock, but not the form of the signal. Moreover the dependence on the spatial profile can be expressed in a geometric way as a transformation of fields under coordinate supertranslations defined near the shockwave front. We also discuss applications of our results to astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The Ultra Slow-Roll Phase Of Warm Inflation In Braneworld Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow-roll of the inflaton (inflationary field) defines the standard dynamics of the inflationary epoch. However, the inflaton deviates from slow-roll when it encounters an extremely flat region in the inflationary potential, and enters a phase dubbed Ultra Slow Roll (USR). In previous studies, there have been various theories which modify the theory of general relativity, all of them having different motivations based on different paradigms. Among these, braneworld gravity, motivated from string theory; is one of the most prominent theories as it provides a geometrical explanation for the weakness of gravity. In this article, we explore two possible braneworld background theories, the Randall-Sundrum (RS-II) model and the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porratai (DGP) model, and then realize an USR phase in a particularly interesting inflationary scenario, called warm inflation. In the warm inflationary scenario, a thermal radiation bath coexists with the inflationary energy density as an effect of the dissipative dynamics. We then derive inflationary slow roll parameters and the primordial power spectrum of scalar curvature perturbations in such a setup. We then numerically investigate the evolution of the inflaton and the primordial power spectrum of scalar curvature perturbations. Our analysis shows that the braneworld contributions become progressively suppressed as the USR conditions are made more stringent, indicating that the USR phase effectively diminishes brane-induced corrections to standard inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: a new window into ultra-light vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), provide a platform to probe new fundamental fields through extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a compact secondary object carrying scalar or vector charges inspirals into a massive primary. In a theory-agnostic framework, we compute the ultra-light vector and gravitational radiation emitted by eccentric EMRIs and determine the corresponding inspiral trajectories. We evaluate the impact of a massive vector (Proca) field on EMRIs waveform through dephasing and mismatches with predictions by general relativity. Using a Fisher information matrix analysis, we further assess LISA's capability to constrain the Proca mass from future EMRIs observations. We find that orbital eccentricity can improve estimation accuracy of parameters, making the vector mass $\mu$ become detectable for the case of $\mu=0.02$ . Correlation analysis further reveals strong positive dependencies between the Proca mass and intrinsic source parameters, indicating that improved measurement of these parameters directly tightens constraints on vector mass. These results demonstrate that high-eccentricity EMRIs observed by LISA offer a powerful channel to detect or constrain massive vector-field extensions of GR in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Symmetry principles of gravitational perturbations in thermal environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instantaneous elastic response of gravitational perturbations to the thermal plasma can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early universe. The obstacle is that there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this contact term, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the thermal initial state on a perturbed FLRW background. Diffeomorphism and Weyl invariance allow the (grand) canonical ensemble, defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that break the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis, providing a nontrivial consistency check and a robust basis for quantum-field-theoretic treatments of gravitational perturbations in thermal environments.</description>

      <title>A Brief Thermodynamic Study For Four Dimensional Einstein Gauss Bonnet Black Holes Using Fractalised Barrow Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity can be particularized to a four dimensional case either using the Glavan, D. and Lin, C. type \cite{glavan2020einstein} limiting method or by the Hordenski type \cite{gurses2007gauss} metric compactification procedure. Depending on ADM mass and Gauss Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha_{GB}$, a black hole solution is prescribed \cite{hennigar2020taking}. The phrase which is responsible for divergence at some finite values of radial coordinate stays inside a square root and thus softens the divergence. A quantum gravity affected surface formula for the black hole is chosen. Fractalized entropy thus formed is known as the Barrow Entropy\cite{ladghami2024barrow}. Global nature for such an entropy formula is discovered. Temperature is calculated with and without different quantum corrections. Stability with such temperature structures are analyzed. To support this, sign changes in specific heat, occurrences of double points in free energy, sign changes and jumps in derivatives of free energy etc are thoroughly discussed. Probable rise of phase transitions are pointed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geodesics in Bardeen Regular Black Hole: Conventional vs. Modified Geometrothermodynamics Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic geometry allow us to study the microscopic behavior of black hole system by defining a metric structure in thermodynamic phase space. Among the various thermodynamic metric structures, metrics defined by geometrothermodynamics (GTD) are extensively used to study the various thermodynamic system due to its Legendre invariant nature. In this work we investigate the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic of Bardeen regular black hole in thermodynamic space defined by three different GTD metrics. Based on the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic as well as thermodynamic curvature we argued that conventional GTD metric need some modifications to reflect all the thermodynamical properties of a system. We also modified the conventional GTD metrics and explore the behavior of thermodynamic geodesic defined by the modified metrics. Our study shows that the modified GTD metrics contain most of the information about the thermodynamical boundaries such as temperature vanishing line, spinodal line etc. of a black hole system. Based on the property of geodesic and Ricci scalar defined by the modified metrics we argued that the modified version of GTD metric are most suitable metric structures for studying the underlying thermodynamic behavior of a black hole system.</description>

      <title>The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory: from the Hamiltonian to applications in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory leads to modified gravity equations that reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view to derive the Hamiltonian associated with this theory. Focusing on isotropic spacetimes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of the GfE theory. We reveal that the FRW metrics are associated with $k$-temperature and $k$-pressure which are related to their local Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated for the case of Friedmann universes that are solutions of the GfE equations of motion in the low energy, small curvature limit. We show that while the total GQRE for unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of Friedmann universes is not decreasing in time.</description>

      <title>The shadow of black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax theory with cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the shadow of a black hole within the framework of $F(R)$-ModMax gravity coupled with a cloud of strings. The Einstein field equations are solved for a nonlinear ModMax electromagnetic source in the context of $F(R)$ gravity and a string cloud. From this solution, we obtain analytical expressions for the photon sphere and shadow radii. Our findings reveal that the interplay between nonlinear electrodynamics, $F(R)$ gravity, and the string cloud significantly alters spacetime geometry, leading to distinct dynamical behaviors for test particles while also amplifying the shadow radius. These results underscore the critical role of cosmic strings effects and modified gravity parameters in shaping black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from collapsing domain walls with full general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of isolated closed domain walls with 3+1 numerical relativity. A closed wall shrinks due to its own surface tension, and its surface energy is converted to the kinetic energy, leading to implosion. Then, it can result in the formation of a black hole. First, we focus on spherically symmetric closed domain walls and clarify whether they finally evolve into black holes. Naively, the wall can collapse if its thickness is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius which is determined by the initial surface energy. Our numerical results support this naive criterion for the black hole formation, and indicate that more than 80% of the initial wall energy falls into the black hole. We also investigate the nonspherical collapse by considering the ellipsoidal configurations for the closed domain walls, and it turns out that black holes can be formed even when the ratio of semi-major to semi-minor axes is 1.5.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave radiation from periodic orbits and quasi-periodic oscillations in Einstein non-linear Maxwell-Yukawa black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the orbital dynamics and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) surrounding a static, spherically symmetric geometry of an Einstein-nonlinear Maxwell-Yukawa (ENMY) black hole (BH). Using the Hamiltonian formalism, we derive equations of motion and analyze the effective potential. We determine the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and innermost bound circular orbits (IBCO) radii for different values of the Yukawa parameters $\lambda$ and $\delta$, and classify periodic orbits via rational frequency analysis, highlighting deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. We also study gravitational wave (GW) emission from periodic orbits and show how Yukawa terms affect GW signals. Fundamental frequencies are computed, and QPOs are analyzed using relativistic precession, warped disk, and tidal disruption models. By increasing $\lambda$, the ENLMY spacetime effectively mimics the behavior of a Schwarzschild spacetime. Constraints on the BH mass and Yukawa parameters are derived using QPO data from stellar-mass (XTE J1550-564, GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105), intermediate-mass (M82 X-1), and supermassive (Sgr A*) BHs within the relativistic precession model by employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Acceleration-Induced Excitations in Confined Quantum Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum field excitations in a rigid cavity that undergoes a transition from inertial motion to uniform acceleration while maintaining constant proper length. By constructing exact Bogoliubov transformations between inertial and accelerated mode bases, we analyze the induced excitations and identify a universal power-law decay in the excitation power spectrum and an alternating pattern in particle production. The spectrum's dependence solely on the acceleration, and not on the size of the box or the observer's position, highlights a kinematic universality akin to that seen in horizon thermodynamics. Generalization to time-dependent accelerations reveals a convolution structure for the Bogoliubov coefficients, with resonant oscillations selectively enhancing mode excitations. These results provide new analytical insights into the interplay between acceleration, confinement, and quantum excitations.</description>

      <title>Overlapping of photon rings in black hole imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the overlapping of photon rings -- higher-order images of a black hole's luminous environment, concentrated near the shadow boundary and expected to be resolved in future observations. We consider a broad class of static spherically symmetric spacetimes and geometrically thin equatorial accretion disk with a prescribed inner radius and infinite outer extent, viewed by a polar observer. Depending on the inner radius of the disk, the thickness of each photon ring varies, and the rings may or may not overlap. To characterize the overlapping, we introduce the radius of merging -- the value of the disk's inner radius at which two photon rings of given orders begin to overlap. Since each radius of merging is labeled by two indices corresponding to the image orders, it becomes possible to arrange these radii in the form of an infinite-dimensional matrix where only the upper right-hand corner is filled. The matrix is a signature of spacetime only, and, once known, it provides a qualitative understanding of the overlapping pattern for any chosen value of the inner radius of the disk. Remarkably, the matrix of merging exhibits several universal properties that hold for all spherically symmetric metrics and can be established even without explicit calculation of light trajectories. Based on these properties, we demonstrate that certain overlapping patterns are universally forbidden across all such spacetimes and for any inner radius of the disk. Examples for the Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstr{\"o}m black holes are provided. The main application of our study is constraining the spacetime metric and the accretion model using observed photon ring overlaps.</description>

      <title>The universal topological charge of black hole photon spheres in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently developed topological approach offers novel insights into photon spheres, which are fundamental to the formation of black hole shadows. In this study, we extend this topological analysis to higher-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black holes. By examining the asymptotic properties of the vector field associated with the photon spheres, we demonstrate that their topological charge is consistently -1. This result is a dimensionally independent invariant, guaranteeing the existence of at least one standard (unstable) photon sphere outside the event horizon. We further explore this conclusion by analyzing two distinct regular black hole solutions derived from pure gravity theory, confirming that the topological charge remains -1 irrespective of the spacetime dimension. These results provide a robust and universal characterization of photon spheres in higher-dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum cosmology of supersymmetric, homogeneous and isotropic, higher derivative models. We recall superfield actions obtained in previous works and give classically equivalent actions leading to second order equations for the bosons, and first order for the fermions. Upon quantization, the algebra of fermions leads to a multi-component state, which is annihilated by the Hamiltonian and supersymmetric constraint operators. We obtain asymptotic wave functions of the oscillatory type, whose classical limit corresponds to inflationary evolution, and exact exponential wave functions. We use the latter to derive probability distributions of the initial curvature that are compatible with those obtained using the non-supersymmetric model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the coset formulation of pure Einstein spacetime, we solve the reduction problem of the nonlinear \(\sigma\)-model for this spacetime and present the process of the inverse scattering technique after simplification. Through the simplified inverse scattering process, taking the pure Rindler metric as the background, we introduce a pair of solitons on the imaginary axis and obtain an accelerating solution in the form of three solitons in this model. By means of appropriate parameter selection and coordinate transformation, we prove that this accelerating solution in the three-soliton formulation is equivalent to the accelerating Kerr solution.</description>

      <title>Can the diffeomorphism and Gauss constraints be holonomy corrected in the deformed algebra approach to modified gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deforming the algebra of constraint is a well known approach to effective loop quantum cosmology. More generally, it is a consistent way to modify gravity from the Hamiltonian perspective. In this framework, the Hamiltonian (scalar) constraint is usually the only one to be holonomy corrected. As a heuristic hypothesis, we consider the possibility to also correct the diffeomorphism and Gauss constraints. It is shown that it is impossible to correct the diffeomorphism constraint without correcting the Gauss one, while maintaining a first-class algebra. However, if all constraints are corrected, the algebra can be closed. The resulting differential equations to be fulfilled by the corrections (of the background and of the perturbations) are derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are thermal objects. They can form thermodynamic phases and exhibit phase transitions. Furthermore, black holes can also radiate, termed as Hawking radiation. However, the signatures of these behaviors are challenging to observe. In this work,we consider Hawking radiation in black hole phase transitions. We uncovered that an echo can emerge from the correlations between individual single event and joint two events. This provides possible signature of black hole phase transition and fluctuations in Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Lensing, not luck! Detection prospects of strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by ground-based observatories will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters. This may produce multiple copies of the signals (i.e., lensed images) arriving at different times at the detector. These, if observed, could offer new probes of astrophysics and cosmology. However, identification of lensed image pairs among a large number of unrelated GW events is challenging. Though the number of lensed events increases with improved detector sensitivity, the false alarms increase quadratically faster. While this "lensing or luck" problem would appear to be insurmountable, we show that the expected increase in measurement precision of source parameters will efficiently weed out false alarms. Based on current astrophysical models and anticipated sensitivities, we predict that the first confident detection could occur in the fifth observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We expect computational costs to be a major hurdle in achieving such a detection, and show that the Posterior Overlap 2.0 method may offer a near-optimal solution to this challenge.</description>

      <title>Probing Warm Inflation via Correlated Gravitational Waves from First Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of gravitational waves generated by heating induced phase transitions in warm inflation. In this scenario, the heating phase of inflation followed by subsequent cosmological cooling can trigger two associated first-order phase transitions and generate characteristic gravitational waves. The correlated gravitational wave spectral features amplitude, peak frequencies, and oscillatory behavior originate from a unified model governing both phase transitions. These signatures allow discrimination between warm and cold inflation models, and give constraint on the key parameters including the dissipative coupling strength and the inflationary energy scale, collectively illuminating early-Universe dissipative dynamics. Future gravitational wave observatories such as BBO, Ultimate DECIGO, $\mu$Ares, resonant cavities, and Pulsar Timing Array experiments, will play a important role in testing these theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: Bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many efforts were made in order to better understand the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, following the work of Comisso and Asenjo in 2021. We also tried to make some progress in our previous works, in which we discussed differences between bulk plasma with different streamlines and also defined the covering factor as an internal property of an accretion system to quantify its capability on extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from its central black hole. In this study, we aim to explore this topic within the framework of a Kerr-Sen-like spacetime induced from Bumblebee gravity, which, among various alternative theories of gravity beyond pure Einstein gravity, stands out as a promising candidate for explaining certain high energy astrophysical phenomena. More specifically, we would like to analyze the influence of the rate of Lorentz symmetry breaking and the Bumblebee charge, the two additional parameters in Bumblebee gravity except for the black hole mass and spin, on the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection. By analyzing the allowed regions for energy extraction and the variations of covering factor, we find that energy extraction becomes more likely to succeed and tends to occur closer to the central region when the spacetime carries bigger rate of Lorentz symmetry breaking and Bumblebee charge. Furthermore, our results indicate that the most favorable spacetime configuration for energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, when the extractable energy of the central black hole is determined, corresponds to the scenario in which the cosmic censorship hypothesis is marginally not violated.</description>

Abstract: In this work, a detailed examination of a specific case of a generalized quasi-Einstein manifold (GQE)n is provided. It begins by exploring generalized quasi-Einstein spacetimes under certain conditions. The analysis then focuses on cases that admit a parallel time-like vector field. Among the findings, it is demonstrated that such spacetimes can be categorized as generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes, Robertson-Walker spacetimes, and quasi-constant curvature spacetimes. Additionally, the physical implications of these results are discussed. It is also investigated (GQE)4 spacetimes, which accept F(R)-gravity and feature a parallel unit time-like vector field. Finally, various energy conditions are analyzed based on the results related to F(R)-gravity.</description>

      <title>Binary gravitational waves as probes of quantum graviton states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the most reliable way to reveal the quantum nature of light is through photon number statistics, since photons exhibiting sub-Poissonian statistics unambiguously demonstrate their quantum behavior. In this paper, we show that gravitons emitted by binary systems can, in principle, exhibit analogous sub-Poissonian statistics. The key idea is that the vacuum state of gravitons may not be the standard Minkowski vacuum but rather a nonclassical state imprinted with the physics of the early Universe, such as inflation. Accordingly, gravitational waves from binary systems provide a means to probe the graviton states generated in the early Universe. As a concrete example, we show that squeezed graviton states originating from inflation may be detected through the observation of gravitational waves from binary systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between thermodynamic phase transitions and the Lyapunov exponent of charged regular anti-de Sitter black holes in quasi-topological gravity. Our results show that the Lyapunov exponent displays oscillatory behavior during phase transitions. Moreover, along the coexistence curve the Lyapunov exponent changes discontinously and continuously at the critical point. Near the critical point, the Lyapunov exponent follows a power-law behavior with a critical exponent of 1/2, suggesting its role as an order parameter and encodes information on black hole phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations for Elastic Hybrid Stars and Quark Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some compact stars may contain deconfined quark matter, forming hybrid stars or quark stars. If the quark matter forms an inhomogeneous condensate in the crystalline color superconducting phase, its rigidity may be high enough to noticeably alter the stellar properties. In this paper, we investigate whether these elastic stars follow the universal relations, i.e., relations insensitive to equations of state, that have been well established for fluid stars. We improve upon previous studies by allowing quark matter in the background, static, and spherically symmetric configuration to be sheared. Such background shear can be treated in the form of an effective pressure anisotropy. We then calculate the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability ${\lambda}_2$, and spin-induced quadrupole moment $Q$ of these models with pressure anisotropy. The $I$-${\lambda}_2$-$Q$ universal relations for the elastic hybrid (quark) star models are valid up to a variation of $\approx2\,(3)\%$, larger than that for typical fluid star models, when the maximal magnitude of quark matter shear modulus is considered in the crystalline color superconducting phase from realistic calculations. The uncertainty in universal relations related to the stellar compactness for these elastic star models, on the other hand, remain comparable to those for typical fluid star models. Our results demonstrate the validity of universal relations for hybrid stars and quark stars with a realistic degree of pressure anisotropy due to the crystalline color superconducting quark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for ultra-light vector dark matter interacting with a rotating torsion balance with a baryon minus lepton number composition dipole. Our search spans candidate masses in the ultra-low mass range from 1.3~$\times10^{-22}$ to 1.9~$\times10^{-18}$ eV. We set limits on the coupling strength to baryon minus lepton number for each dark matter candidate reaching a peak sensitivity of $g_{B-L} \leq 9 \times 10^{-26}$.</description>

      <title>Shadows of the Colossus: Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in a 10-million-body Globular Cluster Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.</description>

      <title>A gauge invariant Hamiltonian evolution across the black hole horizon in asymptotically AdS spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a probe scalar field in the background of a black hole in AAdS spacetime in the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity in the maximal slicing gauge. The black hole solution in this gauge is expressed in terms of wormhole coordinates, a smooth coordinate system with constant time slices that cut across the horizon, and asymptote to the Killing time slices at the boundaries.
  The quantum scalar field is expanded in terms of normalized solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, that are valid at all points in spacetime. The operators that appear in the expansion are in the product space of the CFTs on the two spacetime boundaries, which are by definition gauge invariant under small bulk diffeomorphisms. The entangled Hartle-Hawking (HH) state arises naturally from this construction.
  One of our main results is a well defined formula for the time dependent Hermitian Hamiltonian of the probe scalar in the product space of the two CFTs, which describes the time development of operators/states along the maximal slices. This Hamiltonian acting on the HH state creates a state of finite norm. Consequently there is a unitary description of horizon crossing scalar field excitations on top of the HH state. We also present a bulk reconstruction formula that evaluates an order parameter that signals horizon crossing in the boundary theory.
  We calculate various bulk Wightman two-point functions on the two-sided BTZ black hole. We recover Hawking's thermodynamic results in the exterior region when expressed in terms of BTZ coordinates that are related to the wormhole coordinates by a singular transformation. We compute the two-point function with one insertion in the future/past interior and the other in the exterior. Both are related by a time reflection symmetry and asymptote to a non-zero constant as the coordinate time between the two points becomes large.</description>

      <title>2+1 dimensional gravity in AAdS spacetimes with spatial wormhole slices: Reduced phase space dynamics and the BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve Einstein's equations with negative cosmological constant in $2+1$ dimensions in the Hamiltonian formulation. The spacetime has the topology of $\Sigma \times \mathbf{R}$ where $\mathbf{R}$ corresponds to the time direction and $\Sigma$ is a cylinder $\mathbf{R} \times \mathbf{S}^1$ and the spacetime metric satisfies asymptotically AdS (AAdS) boundary conditions.
  We address the question of gauge invariance by fixing the maximal slicing and spatial harmonic gauge conditions and demonstrate that there are no residual small diffeomorphisms in this gauge. We explicitly solve the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints, and the gauge conditions to obtain a two dimensional reduced phase space. For simplicity, and with the BTZ black hole in mind, we restrict the solution of the momentum constraints to be independent of $\mathbf{S}^1$.
  In AAdS spacetimes besides the standard Wheeler-deWitt equations there is a Schroedinger equation corresponding to the boundary ADM Hamiltonian. We express this Hamiltonian in terms of the reduced phase space variables and discuss its classical solutions and quantization. We exhibit the wave functions and a continuous positive energy spectrum. Each energy eigenvalue $E$ corresponds to a BTZ black hole of mass $M=E/2$. This identification is based on the fact that the classical solution of the reduced phase space dynamics gives rise to a spacetime that is related to the two-sided BTZ black hole by a diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Low-Latency Sky Localization in Multi-Detector Gravitational-Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency analyses of gravitational-wave (GW) data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA enable rapid detection of compact binary coalescences (CBC) and prompt sky localization, essential for electromagnetic follow-up in multi-messenger astronomy. We evaluate the performance and limitations of low-latency sky localization using BAYESTAR algorithm, and investigate the impact of low-significance Virgo triggers. We inject simulated CBC signals into Gaussian-stationary noise and into Virgo data from the second part of the third LIGO-Virgo observing run (O3b), then reconstruct skymaps across multiple detector network configurations. Localization accuracy is assessed using Percentile-Percentile plots, the Jaccard index, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Binary neutron star mergers are statistically consistent with ideal calibration, showing deviations below 3$\sigma$, particularly when Virgo is included in the network, whereas skymaps for neutron star--black hole and binary black hole mergers tend to be overconfident. Adding a third detector generally improves accuracy, but the searched area can degrade when Virgo's signal-to-noise ratio is low (SNR $\leq$ 5). For high-SNR events, relying on two detectors can mislocalize the source. Excluding Virgo can therefore cause the HL skymap to miss the true location when Virgo has strong antenna response, in such cases a three-detector configuration is required to recover the correct position and avoid misleading multi-messenger follow-up. We introduce diagnostics to flag problematic skymaps and apply them to O3 public alerts, recovering simulation-predicted trends and flagging a few anomalous morphologies. The results are relevant for improving rapid vetting of GW alerts and guiding observational strategies in multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dynamical Dark Energy using DESI DR2 Ly$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the cosmological implications of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) Lyman-$\alpha$ forest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with complementary datasets DESI DR2 galaxy BAO, Type Ia supernova (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, and Union3), and compressed CMB likelihood. We test several dynamical dark energy models CPL, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE as well as $\omega$CDM and non-flat extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models. Using the Metropolis Hastings MCMC algorithm implemented in \texttt{SimpleMC}, we constrain the cosmological parameters of each model and evaluate the Bayesian evidence using \texttt{MCEvidence} to assess each model's performance relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show that the inclusion of DESI DR2 Ly$\alpha$ data modestly enhances sensitivity to departures from $\Lambda$CDM. Our results show non-flat extensions remain consistent with spatial flatness ($\Omega_k \approx 0$ within $1$-$2\sigma$). Further, all redshift dependent dark energy models predict $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$, favor a dynamical dark energy scenario characterized by Quintom-B type, and we found that dynamical dark energy favors over the $\Lambda$CDM model ranging from 0.24-2.60$\sigma$, depending on the choice of model and corresponding combination of datasets. Bayesian evidence comparison favors the $\omega$CDM model with moderate evidence over $\Lambda$CDM, whereas other parameterizations remain statistically inconclusive.</description>

Abstract: We study information recovery in black hole evaporation using traversable wormhole protocols in AdS$_2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with matter fields coupled to an external bath. By introducing a simple non-local interaction between left and right radiation regions, we generate negative-energy shockwaves that render the wormhole traversable. We compute the resulting shifts in Kruskal coordinates, changes in the stress tensor, and backreaction effects on quantum extremal surfaces, finding a consistent decrease of the generalized entropy that aligns with the flat Page curve. Finally, we analyze the impact of negative-energy shocks on boundary two-point functions, providing a microscopic probe of island/radiation duality and discussing possible implications for experimental realizations in analog quantum-mechanical models.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble Constant using Cross-Correlation of Gravitational Wave Events with Flux-Limited Galaxy Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary coalescence provide direct measurement of the luminosity distance to the event. However, unlike binary neutron stars, redshift information is not available from GW observations of binary black holes. Consequently, independent redshift measurements of such GW events are necessary to measure $H_0$. In this study, we demonstrate a novel Bayesian formalism to infer $H_0$ utilizing the $3$D cross-correlation of GW events with galaxies from flux-limited catalog in configuration space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $300$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\sim 9 \%$ ($90\%$ highest density interval). We highlight the potential improvements that need to be accounted for in further studies before the method can be applied to real data.</description>

      <title>Avoiding PBH overproduction in inflation model with modified dispersion relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data of nano-Hertz gravitational waves released in 2023 implies that if such gravitational waves comes from the scalar perturbation induction at the end of inflation, the accompanied primordial black holes (PBHs) will be over-produced, with the fraction exceed the upper bound of unity. This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem", which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\sigma$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1\sigma$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$. The mass distribution of the PBHs generated is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational-wave trigger GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger candidate observed in the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Assuming the trigger is of astrophysical origin, we analyze it using state-of-the-art waveform models and investigate the robustness of the inferred source parameters under different prior choices in Bayesian inference. We assess the implications for population studies, nuclear physics, and multi-messenger astronomy. Analysing the component masses, we find that GW231109_235456 supports the proposed double Gaussian mass distribution of neutron star masses. Moreover, we find that the remnant most likely collapsed promptly to a black hole and that, because of the large distance, a possible kilonova connected to the merger was noticeably dimmer than AT2017gfo. In addition, we provide constraints on the equation of state from GW231109_235456 alone, as well as combined with GW170817 and GW190425. In our projections for the future, we simulate a similar event using the upcoming generation of gravitational-wave detectors. Our findings indicate that we can constrain the neutron star radius with an accuracy of 400 meters using the Einstein Telescope alone, or 300 meters when combined with the Cosmic Explorer, both at 90% credibility.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills-Higgs theories with BRST instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theories, when suitably coupled to Higgs-like fields, admit representations in terms of massive gauge fields in a non-trivial neighborhood of the minima moduli. In the adjoint representation, BRST instability is present beyond tree-level, and closely resembles the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The fundamental representation requires realification $SU(N) \hookrightarrow SO(2N)$, but exhibits a more pronounced instability at tree-level. Stable topological solitons (vertices/monopoles) are generically present in the adjoint case. These instabilities indicate the reintroduction of local degrees of freedom into the physical spectrum of these topological field theories. In particular, the realified fundamental case may provide a promising framework for 4d topological gravity models. In addition, our results offer rare examples of BRST symmetry breaking in non-Abelian gauge theories with trivial Gribov problems.</description>

      <title>On the generalized $m$-Kropina metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized $m$-Kropina metrics appear naturally as a spacetime geometry compatible with Lorentz symmetry breaking, leading to useful applications in modified gravity and cosmology. We prove that a generalized $m$-Kropina metric $F$ is an almost rational Finsler metric. Thereby, we study the rationality of its Finslerian geometric objects in the directional variable $y$. For example, its geodesic spray coefficients are rational in $y$. Consequently, we prove that if $F$ is an Einstein metric with $m \notin \mathbb{Z}$, then it is Ricci-flat. Moreover, for $m \in 2 \mathbb{Z}$, if $F$ has isotropic mean Berwald curvature, or has relatively isotropic Landsberg curvature, or has almost vanishing $\mathbf{H}$-curvature, then $F$ is weakly Berwaldian, or $F$ is Landsbergian, or $\mathbf{H}=0$, respectively. We, hence, deduce under what conditions a generalized $m$-Kropina metric $F$ becomes an exact solution to either "Chen and Shen's Finslerian nonvcuum field equations"or "Pfeifer and Wohlfath's vacuum field equation". Finally, some examples of generalized $m$-Kropina metrics in dimension $4$, which has significant applications in modified gravity and cosmology, are provided.</description>

      <title>Detecting ultralight dark matter in the Galactic Center with pulsars around Sgr A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) model is a leading dark matter candidate that arises naturally in extensions of the Standard Model. In the Galactic Center, ULDM manifests as dense hydrogen-like boson clouds or self-gravitating soliton cores. We present the first study of the gravitational effects of these ULDM structures on pulsar orbits around Sgr A*, using pulsar timing as a precision dynamical probe, based on a comprehensive and practical framework that includes various kinds of black hole and orbital parameters. Our analysis shows that long-term pulsar monitoring -- one of the key objectives of future SKA science -- could detect a boson cloud with a total mass as low as $O(M_\odot)$ for boson mass $m \sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, and probe a wide range of soliton core masses in the lower-mass regime, assuming a conservative timing precision of $\sigma_{\mathrm{TOA}}=1\,\mathrm{ms}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate pinched geometries in a two-dimensional Lorentzian model of quantum Regge calculus (QRC) using the tensor renormalization group (TRG) method. A pinched geometry refers to a configuration with an infinitely long temporal extent, even when the total spacetime area is fixed. We examine several choices of integration measures and triangulations to study whether such geometries can dominate in the limit of infinitely many triangles. Our results indicate that pinched geometries are strongly suppressed, and this suppression is observed across different integral measures and triangulations. These results suggest the possible emergence of smooth geometries as well as a sort of universality for infinitely many triangles.</description>

      <title>Toward Krylov-based holography in double-scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the duality between Krylov complexity and geodesic length in Jackiw-Teitelboim and sine-dilaton gravity, we develop a precise holographic dictionary for quantities in the Krylov subspace of the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (DSSYK). First, we demonstrate that the growth rate of Krylov state complexity corresponds to the wormhole velocity, and show that its expectation value in coherent states serves as a boundary diagnostic of firewall-like structures via bulk reconstruction. We also delineate an alternative bulk description in terms of the proper momentum of an infalling particle at early times, establishing a threefold duality between the Krylov complexity growth rate, wormhole velocity, and proper momentum, with clear regimes of validity. Beyond the first moments, we argue that higher-order Krylov complexities capture connected bulk contributions encoded by replica wormholes, while the logarithmic variant probes the replica saddle structure. Finally, within a third-quantized setting incorporating baby universes, we show that the Krylov entropy equals the von Neumann entropy of the parent-geometry density matrix obtained after tracing out baby universes, thereby quantifying information flow into the baby universe sector. Together, these results elevate Krylov-space observables to sharp probes of bulk dynamics and topology in ensemble-averaged 2D gravity.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to be canonical, its time evolution becomes identical to an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This finding provides strong evidence that, akin to general relativity where free particles follow geodesics, purely random processes also follow ``straight lines" defined by the geometry of information. This geometric principle is a direct consequence of the dually flat structure inherent to information geometry, originating from the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) leading to the violation of metric compatibility. Our results suggest a geometric foundation for randomness and open the door to an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>A new group of low-spin $50-70M_\odot$ Black Holes and the high pair-instability mass cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISN) will not leave compact remnants and hence yield a mass gap of the black holes. Though a transition point of $\sim 45M_\odot$ between low-spin and high-spin black holes groups had been inferred with gravitational wave data since 2022 and then interpreted as the signature of the PISN mass gap, here we report the emergence of a new group of low-spin but massive ($\sim 50-70M_\odot$) black holes, which are hard to produce via hierarchical mergers, in the latest GWTC-4.0 data. Correspondingly, the mass cutoff of the low-spin black holes shifts to $68.5^{+19.8}_{-18.5}M_\odot$ ($90\%$ credibility), which is consistent with the PISN model for a low $^{12}C(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}O$ reaction rate of $S_{300{\rm keV}} \sim 110~{\rm keV~b}$. Despite that the massive single-star collapse/dynamical capture origin can not be reliably tested at this moment, a high pair-instability mass cutoff $M_{\rm low}\sim 70M_\odot$ may be favored for its capability of accounting for the rather low observation rate of hydrogen-less super-luminous supernovae.</description>

      <title>Local gauge invariant operator on isometry breaking background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whereas local field operators play the crucial role in reconciling quantum mechanics and special relativity, they are not trivially compatible with the diffeomorphism invariance of gravity. In order to address this issue, we consider the background geometry which breaks the isometry spontaneously. Then the local gauge invariant operator can be constructed through the St\"uckelberg mechanism, where the fluctuation of the metric in the direction of the isometry breaking combines with that of matter whose classical solution breaks the isometry. This is equivalent to introducing the clock and the rod to promote the local field operators to the gauge invariant ones. A typical example is the curvature perturbation in quasi-de Sitter space arising from the spontaneous breaking of the timelike isometry. We also discuss the features of the local gauge invariant operator when the spacelike isometry is spontaneously broken. Meanwhile, even if the local gauge invariant operators exist, it does not guarantee the reliable construction of the gauge invariant operators on the local region like the island, which is regarded as an essential ingredient to resolve the black hole information paradox. This is because the fluctuation of the spacetime point is accumulated in time, which in fact also gives rise to eternal inflation in quasi-de Sitter space. In order to suppress the fluctuation at late time, the isometry must be strongly broken by the background. In the case of the evaporating black hole, it may be achieved by the transition to the higher dimensional black hole.</description>

      <title>Exploring the accelerating black holes from the observations of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes in dense astrophysical environments, such as globular clusters or in the vicinity of other massive objects, may possess accelerations. Such acceleration would modulate the characteristics of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray black hole binaries. In this paper, we explore the influence of spin-aligned acceleration of a black hole on QPOs observed in X-ray binaries. For this purpose, we compute the fundamental frequencies arising from the motion of test particles around an accelerating (spin-aligned) black hole and apply the relativistic precession, parametric resonance, and forced resonance models to establish their correspondence with several observed QPOs of X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, XTE J1859+226, GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, M82~X-1, and Sgr~A$^{*}$). We then employ the Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the black hole parameters. Our results show no evidence for spin-aligned acceleration in any of the analyzed sources, suggesting that most of these X-ray binaries reside in isolated environments and therefore experience only small perturbations to the background spacetime geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Oscillatory Unruh Effect with Superposed Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect predicts an astonishing phenomenon that an accelerated detector would detect counts despite being in a quantum field vacuum in the rest frame. Since the required detector acceleration for its direct observation is prohibitively large, recent analog studies on quantum simulation platforms help to reveal various properties of the Unruh effect and explore the not-yet-understood physics of quantum gravity. To further reveal the quantum aspect of the Unruh effect, analogous experimental exploration of the correlation between the detector and the field, and the consequences for coherent quantum trajectories of the detector without classical counterparts, are essential steps but are currently missing. Here, we utilize a laser-controlled trapped ion to experimentally simulate an oscillating detector coupled with a cavity field. We observe joint excitation of both the detector and the field in the detector's frame, coincide with the coordinated dynamics predicted by the Unruh effect. Particularly, we simulate the detector moving in single and superposed quantum trajectories, where the latter case shows coherent interference of excitation. Our demonstration reveals properties of quantum coherent superposition of accelerating trajectories associated with quantum gravity theories that have no classical counterparts, and may offer a new avenue to investigate phenomena in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. We also show how a generalization of the method and results in this work may be beneficial for direct observation of the Unruh effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we perform Bayesian inference on quarkyonic equation-of-state models and find they remain viable under all current astrophysical constraints. Crucially, we identify a novel observational diagnostic- the slope of the M-R relation at fixed mass versus the central sound speed. Quarkyonic stars occupy a distinct region (high central $c_s^2$ and positive $\frac{dR}{dM}$) from purely nucleonic stars. This could be tested by future radius measurements of two stars of different mass. Our results indicate that if a neutron star falls in the quarkyonic region, it would be strong evidence for quarkyonic matter in its core.</description>

      <title>Many-body chaos and pole-skipping in holographic charged rotating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope solution.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new tetrads that manifestly and covariantly diagonalize the stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid with vorticity at every spacetime point. This new tetrad can be applied and introduce simplification in the analysis of astrophysical relativistic problems where vorticity is present through the Carter-Lichnerowicz equation. This new tetrad also enables the construction in a simple fashion of Euler and Coordinate observers relevant to the Cauchy evolution of many hydrodynamical relativistic problems in the case with no vorticity and the presence of a symmetry where the tetrads are completely analogous to the case with vorticity. We also discuss the origin of inertia in this special case from the standpoint of our new local tetrads.</description>

Abstract: Analog Hawking radiation emitted by a perfectly reflecting mirror in (1+3)-dimensional flat spacetime is investigated. This is accomplished by studying the reflected frequency and momentum based on Einstein's mirror, instead of the canonical way of solving, if possible, wave equations subjected to a dynamical Dirichlet boundary condition. In the case of a finite-size mirror, diffraction pattern appears in the radiation spectrum. Based on the relevant parameters in the proposed Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers experiment, in which the Hawking temperature $T_{H}\simeq 0.03$ eV and the mirror area $A\simeq (50\;\mu\mathrm{m})^{2}$, the Hawking photon yield is estimated to be $N\simeq 16$/laser shot.</description>

Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves (GWs) paves the beginning of a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. Black holes (BHs) in their ringdown phase provide the cleanest signal of emitted GWs that imprint the fundamental nature of BHs under low energy perturbation. Apart from GWs, any complementary signature of ringing BHs can be of paramount importance. Motivated by this we analyzed the scattering of electromagnetic waves in such a background and demonstrated that the absorption cross section of a ringing Schwarzschild BH can be superradiant. Moreover, we have found out that such superradiant phenomena are transient in nature with a characteristic time scale equal to the GW oscillation time scale. We further point out that the existing ground-based Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), radio telescopes, may be able to detect such transient signals from BHs of mass range $M\sim 10^{-1} - 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, which should necessarily be of primordial origin. Our present result opens up an intriguing possibility of observing the black hole merging phenomena through electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariance Breaking in Gravity and Cosmological Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffeomorphism invariance breaking has been investigated in the literature in several contexts, including emergent General Relativity (GR). If GR emerges from an underlying theory without diffeomorphism invariance, there may be small violations of this symmetry at low energies. Since such small violations should not cause instabilities in cosmological evolution, it is a suitable framework for examining such symmetry-breaking effects. In this paper, the cosmological evolution with broken diffeomorphism invariance is investigated in the (modified) FLRW spacetime in the effective theory framework. The GR Lagrangian is augmented with all diffeomorphism-breaking but Lorentz-invariant terms in the leading order, namely, those involving two derivatives. The magnitudes of (minor) violations are kept general modulo the conditions arising in the linearized theory. The analytic solutions of the scale factor in the full non-linear theory for the single-component universes are attempted; the radiation and vacuum solutions are found analytically, whereas the matter solution is worked out numerically since an analytic solution does not exist in the required form. It is observed that the solutions smoothly connect to those of GR in the limit of vanishing symmetry-breaking. The more realistic, two-component, and three-component universes are numerically studied, and no signs of singular behavior are observed: minor diffeomorphism-violating modifications to GR at the level of two derivatives do not cause instabilities in the basic cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>What Hawking Radiation Looks Like as You Fall into a Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the measurements of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt particle detector near the horizon of a semiclassical Schwarzschild black hole. Our results show that the detector's response increases smoothly as it approaches and crosses the horizon in both the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh vacua. However, these measurements are dominated by the effects of switching the detector on and off, rather than by the detection of Hawking radiation particles. We demonstrate that a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt detector cannot directly measure Hawking radiation near the horizon because the time required for thermalization is longer than the time spent near the horizon. We propose an operational definition of the effective temperature along an infalling trajectory based on measurements by a particle detector. Using this method, we find that the effective temperature measured by a freely falling observer in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum increases smoothly from the Hawking temperature far from the horizon to twice the Hawking temperature at the horizon, and continues to rise into the interior of the black hole. This effective temperature closely matches an analytical prediction derived by embedding Schwarzschild spacetime into a higher-dimensional Minkowski space, suggesting that further exploration of higher-dimensional embeddings could provide new insights into the near-horizon behavior of black holes.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter, Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity</title>

Abstract: In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of ({\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of such {\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\bf qgcs} in inflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrected Geodesic Motion in Polymer Kerr-like Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating black holes are prevalent in astrophysical observations, and a Kerr-like solution that incorporates quantum gravity effects is essential for constructing realistic models. In this work, we analyze the geodesic motion of massive particles in a Kerr-like polymer spacetime, incorporating quantum corrections via a parameter $A_\lambda$. We demonstrate that increasing $A_\lambda$ allows for additional orbital evolution in extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems before merging. Our results show that the radii, energy, and angular momentum of both the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and marginal circular orbit (MCO) decrease as $A_\lambda$ increases. Furthermore, when the primary object becomes a wormhole, both prograde ISCO and MCO can intersect the transition surface at the wormhole throat and vanish as $A_\lambda$ grows. Additionally, we find that the eccentricity of periodic geodesic motion decreases monotonically with increasing $A_\lambda$. Finally, we explore the variation of the rational number that characterizes periodic motion and highlight the influence of the quantum parameter on different types of periodic orbits, classified by a set of integers associated with the rational number. This work contributes to the understanding of quantum gravity effects and offers potential observational signatures, particularly in the study of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between pair-created twin universes with opposite time arrows should leave a birthmark on CMB spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why (and how) the Universe was born is one of the ultimate questions in physics. Another big puzzle is about the arrow of time: why is there only one direction of time? Are these two issues related? One way to solve both puzzles at one stroke is to posit that our universe was pair-created with a twin, whose time arrow is opposite to ours. If so, then the twins must naturally be quantum entangled. In Euclidean quantum gravity, this implies the existence of a Euclidean wormhole bridging the twin universes. Each universe is then in a mixed-state and the mutual entanglement shall leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum. Invoking the Klebanov-Susskind-Banks wormhole as a toy model for the sake of tractability, we show that the entanglement selects a novel and unique global vacuum for the total inflaton perturbations in both universes. This is equivalent to imposing a simple harmonic oscillator boundary condition on the Euclidean wavefunction of the total perturbations, and it turns out that the entanglement enhances the CMB power spectrum for long-wavelength modes. Such a birthmark renders our notion refutable.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Tidal Dissipation Numbers of Non-rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of tidal dissipation numbers (TDNs) quantifies the absorption of the tidal force exerted by a companion during an inspiralling phase of a binary compact object. This tidal dissipation generally affects the gravitational waveform, and measuring the TDNs of a black hole (BH) allows us to test the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we develop a parametrized formalism for calculating the TDNs of static and spherically symmetric BH backgrounds using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method, which connects the underlying perturbative equations with observable quantities in gravitational-wave observations in a theory-agnostic manner. Our formalism applies to any system where the master equation has the form of the Regge-Wheeler/Zerilli equation with a small correction to the effective potential. As an application of our formalism, we consider three examples: the effective field theory of BH perturbations with timelike scalar profile, the Einstein-Maxwell system, and a higher-curvature extension of general relativity. We also discuss the absence of logarithmic running for the TDNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the charging performance of a quantum battery coupled to a scalar field in the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole. We show that for Dirichlet boundary conditions, the black hole rotation enhances the charging performance at finite times when the quantum battery's energy level spacing is smaller than the charging amplitude, whereas it degrades the charging performance in other parameter regimes. Notably, as the black hole approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates that the performance of quantum battery can probe critical properties of black holes. Additionally, regarding the energy flow in quantum battery, it is further demonstrated that the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation suppresses the quantum battery's capacity to extract this energy. Our findings not only advance the relativistic dissipation dynamics of quantum battery but also propose a novel method to detect black hole rotation and extremal-state transitions.</description>

      <title>Avoidance of Big Crunch Singularity in the Q-SC-CDM model via nonminimal coupling: Theory and Data Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models non-minimally coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and parameterized coupling $\xi$. We study the cosmological dynamics for a recently proposed descending dark energy model, namely, Q-SC-CDM. Initially, we choose distinct values of coupling parameter. For some values of $\xi$, the evolution of the universe is split up into three different phases: {\it decelerated expansion (early time), accelerated expansion (late-time) and slow-contraction (future era)}, and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future. In other scenario, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes, cosmic acceleration is obtained at current epoch, and the universe gets de-Sitter expansion at distant future. It is remarkable to see that the Big Crunch Singularity is redundant in the later case. Next, we investigate the phase space analysis for the model under consideration. Our investigation brings new asymptotic regimes and finds stable de-Sitter solution. Eventually, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI DR2) data. The results demonstrate that the present model yield constraints on key cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild tension with Pantheon+ measurements. Additionally, we employ the Om(z) diagnostic test, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM. The Statistical comparison reveals moderate support for the current model.</description>

We derive the associated anomalies and solve the entire system in several specific cases. New restrictions on the generalized holonomy corrections are obtained.</description>

      <title>Muffled Murmurs: Environmental effects in the LISA stochastic signal from stellar-mass black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The population of unresolved stellar-mass black hole binaries (sBBHs) is expected to produce a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) potentially detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this work, we compute the imprint of astrophysical environmental effect--such as gas dynamical friction and accretion--on this background. Using the sBBHs population constraints obtained by the LIGO--Virgo--Kagra collaboration, we compute the expected SGWB and develop a phenomenological parametric model that can accurately capture the effect of dynamical friction and accretion. Using our model, we perform Bayesian inference on simulated signals to assess the detectability of these environmental effects. We find that even for large injected values of the Eddington ratio, the effect of accretion in the SGWB is undetectable by LISA. However, LISA will be able to constrain the effect of dynamical friction with an upper bound on the gas density of $\rho \lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$, thus probing the sBBH environment forming in typical thin accretion disks around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For injected densities of $\rho \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9} \mathrm{g} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, dynamical friction effects can be well measured and clearly distinguished from vacuum, with Bayes factors reaching up to $\sim$ 60, even when the Galactic foreground is included.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbations of Extended NGR Model with Parity Violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently the modified teleparallel gravity models attracted a lot of interests. In this paper we consider more extensions to the New General Relativity (NGR) model with parity violations. This extended NGR model differs from the normal NGR model by the inclusion of additional parity-odd term that is quadratic in the torsion tensor. By investigating its cosmological perturbations of this model, we find that this model can avoid ghost instabilities in certain regions of the parameter space, where the coefficient of the parity-odd term does not vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dal\'{i} reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key result is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa \rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa \phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable, non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by $\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast $\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus $\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable approach to interacting dark energy.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamic phase transition of ModMax anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes using Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular orbits. Our results demonstrate that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent serves as an efficient probe of the black hole's phase structure. We calculate the discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent across the transition and show that it acts as an order parameter, exhibiting a critical exponent $\delta=1/2$ in the vicinity of the critical point. Furthermore, we explore the violation of the chaos bound, finding that the bound is violated when the horizon radius falls below a threshold value. We also examine how the ModMax parameter and the particle's angular momentum modify this threshold, revealing their role in controlling the onset of chaos bound violation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out the first computation of gravitational quasinormal modes of black holes with arbitrary rotation in a theory with higher-derivative corrections. Our analysis focuses on a recently identified quartic-curvature theory that preserves the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and that is connected to string theory. We find a master equation that governs large-momentum gravitational perturbations in this theory. By solving this equation with WKB methods, we provide complete results for the corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies for arbitrary spin and arbitrary $\mu=m/(\ell+1/2)$, where $\ell$ and $m$ are the harmonic numbers. Our results show that the corrections become orders of magnitude larger when the spin is close to extremality, with the modes close to the critical value of $\mu$ that separates damped and zero-damped modes being particularly sensitive. We also perform a geometric-optics analysis of gravitational-wave propagation around black holes and relate the equatorial ``graviton-sphere'' orbits to quasinormal mode frequencies with $\ell=m$. We find that the usual correspondence between the Lyapunov exponent of those orbits and the imaginary part of the frequency is modified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability.
  In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers.
  To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3).
  We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetic-Hydrodynamics and Turbulence in Early Universe</title>

Abstract: The nonlinear coupling between spacetime geometry and matter in the early Universe remains a frontier in theoretical cosmology. By introducing a novel gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamic framework, we reveal a fundamental analogy between magnetohydrodynamics and the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and relativistic plasma. We demonstrate that, in high-energy environments such as the electroweak phase transition, the (newly defined) gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, signifying a strongly coupled system where the gravitomagnetic field could be frozen into the fluid. This coupling inevitably leads to the emergence of gravitational Alfv\'en waves and could drive a transition to turbulence involving the dynamics of spacetime itself. Our findings suggest that gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamic turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.</description>

      <title>Exact Black Hole Solutions in Bumblebee Gravity with Lightlike or Spacelike VEVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in Lorentz-violating theories of gravity, we obtain new black hole solutions within the framework of bumblebee gravity, where the bumblebee vector field possesses two independent nonzero components and acquires either a lightlike or spacelike vacuum expectation value. Within this framework, we derive new Schwarzschild-like and Schwarzschild-(A)dS-like black hole solutions. By further incorporating a nonminimally coupled electromagnetic field, we generalize these to new charged black hole solutions. These solutions extend previous results by including additional Lorentz-violating parameters. A key finding is that even for lightlike vacuum expectation values, the black hole solutions exhibit distinct corrections from Lorentz violation. Furthermore, we present a preliminary analysis of their thermodynamic properties. Similar to previous studies that reported a discrepancy between the black hole entropy and the Wald entropy in bumblebee gravity with spacelike vacuum expectation values, our solutions in the spacelike case exhibit the same behavior. In contrast, for the lightlike case considered here, the two entropies coincide.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of Rotating Hairy Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating hairy black holes (RHBHs) are axisymmetric equilibrium solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, consisting of a spinning black hole surrounded by a toroidal distribution of complex scalar field. Despite their potential astrophysical relevance, the stability of these configurations -- naturally expected to form through superradiant growth of light bosonic fields -- remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the stability of RHBHs by performing fully non-linear numerical evolutions of several configurations that differ in the relative mass contribution of the scalar-field torus. We find that configurations in which the scalar field mass is subdominant compared to the black hole mass remain stable throughout the evolution. In contrast, when the scalar-field mass dominates, the system develops an instability akin to the non-axisymmetric instability observed in rotating boson stars. Given the expected limits on the scalar-field mass growth achievable through superradiance, our results suggest that rotating hairy black holes formed predominantly by this process are expected to be stable.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Probing the Holographic Universe: Aspects of Entanglement Entropy Modifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is crucial for understanding the link between quantum mechanics and information theory. This thesis investigates how energy fluctuations and acceleration affect entanglement entropy through three key scenarios. First, we analyze entanglement between disjoint Rindler observers in de Sitter spacetime. We introduce 1-loop corrections to the partition function of the conformal field theory, disrupting the previously flat entanglement spectrum and resulting in an area law for entanglement entropy, while preserving the finiteness of the Hilbert space. Next, we extend the holographic entanglement entropy framework to field theories with global $U(1)$ symmetry, considering non-linearly charged theories and their thermal and quantum fluctuations. We find that the dual theory experiences spontaneous symmetry breaking and a reduction in the leading-order coefficient of the $\langle TT\rangle$ correlator due to quantum corrections. Using conformal electrodynamics coupled with three-dimensional gravity as an example, we explore a black hole solution and its connection to two-dimensional free bosons. Finally, we investigate three-dimensional accelerating black holes, revealing that increased acceleration reduces the accessible boundary region and, consequently, the entanglement entropy. This suggests a loss of information in the dual theory due to acceleration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scalar Field Dynamics On A Maximally Sliced Two-sided AdS Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-classical dynamics of a scalar field in the background of a black hole in an asymptotically AdS (AAdS) spacetime, in the framework of the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. The small diffeomorphism (gauge) symmetries generated by the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints are completely fixed by the maximal slicing and spatial harmonic/Dirac gauge conditions after which the residual phase space degrees of freedom are gauge invariant. While many of our results are valid for AAdS$_{d+1}$ spacetimes, we mainly discuss the $d=2$ case of the static BTZ solution. We present the explicit solution for the smooth maximal slicing of the fully extended BTZ solution where the spatial slices cut across the horizons, asymptote to the usual Schwarzschild slices, do not include the past and future singularities, and for which the lapse remains non-zero at the bifurcate point. We also derive unique large diffeomorphisms that asymptote to time translations on both boundaries in the maximal slicing gauge.
  We present the solution of the scalar field wave equation in this gauge in terms of its boundary values which correspond to boundary CFT operators by the AdS/CFT dictionary. We explicitly construct the finite, time-dependent Hamiltonian in terms of a discrete set of mode functions of the scalar field that are smooth and differentiable across the horizons of the fully extended BTZ black hole. These modes mix the boundary operators from the two sides and are appropriate linear combinations of the Hartle-Hawking-Unruh modes. This Hamiltonian is an operator in the product of the two CFTs associated to the two boundaries and describes the time evolution of CFT operators. Our results are valid for evolution times smaller than the scrambling time during which the fully extended BTZ solution continues to be a valid saddle point of the quantum gravity path integral.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>The Route to Unveil the Cosmic Genealogy of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), generated by unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), provides a unique probe of their population and its cosmic evolution. In this work, we explore the potential of uncovering the SMBHB population and its redshift dependence by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy distribution through cross-correlation analyses. Using a Fisher analysis technique, we show that the SGWB power spectrum alone can not provide any information on the evolutionary history of SMBHBs, whereas the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of the SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution substantially improves constraints on the redshift evolution parameters. Assuming pulsar timing array (PTA) configurations achievable in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era, we find that the combined use of isotropic and anisotropic SGWB signals, together with galaxy surveys, can provide valuable measurements of the redshift evolution of the SMBH-galaxy connection and the frequency distribution of SMBHBs. These results highlight the potential of joint GW-galaxy studies to address the long-standing open question of SMBH growth and evolution across cosmic time.</description>

Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a conformal junction connecting three 2D conformal field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The holographic dual consists of three AdS$_3$ spacetimes joined along the worldsheet of a tensile string anchored at the junction. Within a specific range of string tension, where the bulk solution is uniquely determined, we find that all energy reflection and transmission coefficients vary monotonically with the string tension. Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quark Stars with Quark-Quark Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of phase transitions between different quark matter phases occurring within quark stars, giving rise to the hybrid quark stars (HybQSs). First, we obtain the generic phase diagram of possible mass-radius relation forms for the HybQSs. Then, utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurement $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\Lambda_{1.4M_{\odot}}&lt;800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. Furthermore, we found that the quark-quark phase transitions in hybrid quark stars may also cause the deviation from the approximate universal relation between the dominant postmerger frequency $f_{\rm peak}$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.35M_{\odot}}$, which was previously believed to only be caused by the hadron-quark phase transitions in hybrid neutron stars. This work unveils new possibilities of phase transitions and the resulting new types of compact stars in realistic astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <title>The 300 TeV photon from GRB 221009A: a Hint at Non-linear Lorentz Invariance Violation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.</description>

Abstract: The detection by the Carpet-3 Group of a 300 TeV photon, observed 4536 seconds after the prompt emission of the historic gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, provides unprecedented opportunities to test Lorentz invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime. By analyzing the temporal and spatial properties of this ultra-high-energy photon in conjunction with lower-energy photons from other bursts and the same burst, we demonstrate consistency with subluminal LV scenarios characterized by an energy scale \( E_{\rm LV} \sim 3 \times 10^{17} \, \rm{GeV} \). This work bridges multi-year LV studies using GeV-TeV photons and establishes GRB 221009A as a pivotal laboratory for quantum spacetime phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Trapping, chaos and averaging in bubbling AdS spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss chaos and ensemble averaging in 1/2 BPS bubbling $AdS$ spaces of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) by studying trapped and escaping null geodesics and estimating their decay rates. We find typical chaotic scattering behavior and confirm the Pesin relation between escape rates, Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. On the other hand, for geodesics in coarse-grained (grayscale) LLM geometries (which exhibit a naked singularity) chaos is strongly suppressed, which is consistent with orbits and escape rates averaged over microscopic backgrounds. Also the singularities in these grayscale geometries produce an attractive potential and have some similarities to black hole throats trapping geodesics for a long time. Overall, averaging over the ensembles of LLM geometries brings us closer toward the typical behavior of geodesics in black hole backgrounds, but some important differences remain, in particular the existence of a threshold timescale when the averaging fails.</description>

      <title>Ghost-free, gauge invariant SVT generalizations of Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the generalizations of Kaluza--Klein compactifications of 5D Horndeski theory. They are Scalar--Vector--Tensor (SVT) theories with higher derivatives in the action, but with second order equations of motion. The vector field is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation and the Scalar--Tensor sector corresponds to Horndeski theory. A subclass of these SVT theories is such that the Horndeski functions $G_4(\pi,X)$ and $G_5(\pi)$ remain free, while the speed of the tensor and vector modes is exactly the same. We show a subclass where the vector sector retains freedom through new functions of $\pi,\, X$ while the speed of the vector modes still tracks the speed of the tensor modes.</description>

      <title>CHRONOS: Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detector, the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), optimized for the unexplored 0.1-10Hz band bridging the gap between the space-based LISA and future ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \simeq 1 \times 10^{-18}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Tests of restricted Quantum Focusing and a new CFT bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC) plays a central role in an axiomatic formulation of semiclassical gravity. Since much hinges on its validity, it is imperative to subject the rQFC to rigorous tests in novel settings. Here we do so in two independent directions. First, we prove rQFC in a class of spacetime dimension $d=2$ toy models, JT gravity coupled to a QFT. We also construct explicit counter-examples to the original and stronger Quantum Focusing Conjecture in a regime where matter quantum effects are comparable to the total dilaton value. Second, for $d&gt;2$, we derive from the rQFC a constraint stronger than the Quantum Null Energy Condition (QNEC). In a broad class of states, this bound forbids the QNEC from saturating faster than $O(\mathcal{A})$ as the transverse area $\mathcal{A}$ of a certain null deformation shrinks to zero. We speculate about a universal strengthened QNEC holding across all QFT states.</description>
