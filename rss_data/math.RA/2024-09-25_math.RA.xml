      <title>On semigroups that are prime in the sense of Tarski, and groups prime in the senses of Tarski and of Rhodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of algebras closed under finite direct products, and $M_\mathcal{C}$ the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of members of $\mathcal{C},$ with operation induced by direct product, A.Tarski defines a nonidentity element $p$ of $M_\mathcal{C}$ to be prime if, whenever it divides a product of two elements in that monoid, it divides one of them, and calls an object of $\mathcal{C}$ prime if its isomorphism class has this property.
  McKenzie, McNulty and Taylor ask whether the category of nonempty semigroups has any prime objects. We show in section 2 that it does not. However, for the category of monoids, and some other subcategories of semigroups, we obtain examples of prime objects in sections 3-5 In section 6, two related questions open so far as I know, are recalled.
  In section 7, which can be read independently of the rest of this note, we recall two related conditions that are called primeness by semigroup theorists, and obtain results and examples on the relationships among those two conditions and Tarski's, in categories of groups. Section 8 notes an interesting characterization of one of those conditions when applied to finite algebras in an arbitrary variety.
  Various questions are raised.</description>

      <title>Auslander-Reiten's Cohen-Macaulay algebras and contracted preprojective algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05603v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auslander and Reiten called a finite dimensional algebra $A$ over a field Cohen-Macaulay if there is an $A$-bimodule $W$ which gives an equivalence between the category of finitely generated $A$-modules of finite projective dimension and the category of finitely generated $A$-modules of finite injective dimension. For example, Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras and algebras with finitistic dimension zero on both sides are Cohen-Macaulay, and tensor products of Cohen-Macaulay algebras are again Cohen-Macaulay. They seem to be all of the known examples of Cohen-Macaulay algebras.
  In this paper, we give the first non-trivial class of Cohen-Macaulay algebras by showing that all contracted preprojective algebras of Dynkin type are Cohen-Macaulay. As a consequence, for each simple singularity $R$ and a maximal Cohen-Macaulay $R$-module $M$, the stable endomorphism algebra $\underline{End}_R(M)$ is Cohen-Macaulay. We also give a negative answer to a question of Auslander-Reiten asking whether the category $CM A$ of Cohen-Macaulay $A$-modules coincides with the category of $d$-th syzygies, where $d\ge1$ is the injective dimension of $W$. In fact, if $A$ is a Cohen-Macaulay algebra that is additionally $d$-Gorenstein in the sense of Auslander, then $CM A$ always coincides with the category of $d$-th syzygies.</description>

      <title>On semisubtractive ideals of semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our aim in this paper is to explore semisubtractive ideals of semirings. We prove that they form a complete modular lattice. We introduce Golan closures and prove some of their basic properties. We explore the relations between $Q$-ideals and semisubtractive ideals of semirings, and also study them in $s$-local semirings. We introduce two subclasses of semisubtractive ideals: $s$-strongly irreducible and $s$-irreducible, and provide various representation theorems. By endowing a topology on the set of semisubtractive ideals, we prove that the space is $T_0$, sober, connected, and quasi-compact. We also briefly study continuous maps between semisubtractive spaces. We construct $s$-congruences and prove a bijection between these congruences and semisubtractive ideals.</description>

      <title>Lie algebras arising from two-periodic projective complex and derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-algebra of finite global dimension and $\mathcal{A}$ be the category of finitely generated right $A$-modules. By using of the category of two-periodic projective complexes $\mathcal{C}_2(\mathcal{P})$, we construct the motivic Bridgeland's Hall algebra for $\mathcal{A}$, where structure constants are given by Poincar\'{e} polynomials in $t$, then construct a $\mathbb{C}$-Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{n}\oplus \mathfrak{h}$ at $t=-1$, where $\mathfrak{n}$ is constructed by stack functions about indecomposable radical complexes, and $\mathfrak{h}$ is by contractible complexes. For the stable category $\mathcal{K}_2(\mathcal{P})$ of $\mathcal{C}_2(\mathcal{P})$, we construct its moduli spaces and a $\mathbb{C}$-Lie algebra $\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}=\tilde{\mathfrak{n}}\oplus \tilde{\mathfrak{h}}$, where $\tilde{\mathfrak{n}}$ is constructed by support-indecomposable constructible functions, and $\tilde{\mathfrak{h}}$ is by the Grothendieck group of $\mathcal{K}_2(\mathcal{P})$. We prove that the natural functor $\mathcal{C}_2(\mathcal{P})\rightarrow \mathcal{K}_2(\mathcal{P})$ together with the natural isomorphism between Grothendieck groups of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{K}_2(\mathcal{P})$ induces a Lie algebra isomorphism $\mathfrak{g}\cong\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}$. This makes clear that the structure constants at $t=-1$ provided by Bridgeland in [5] in terms of exact structure of $\mathcal{C}_2(\mathcal{P})$ precisely equal to that given in [30] in terms of triangulated category structure of $\mathcal{K}_2(\mathcal{P})$.</description>

      <title>Poisson bundles over unordered configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a Poisson algebra bundle whose distributional sections are suitable to represent multilocal observables in classical field theory. To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered configuration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a $2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles and a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the usual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric algebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle mimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in field theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra bundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.</description>
