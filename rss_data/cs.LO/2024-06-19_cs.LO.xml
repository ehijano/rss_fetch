      <title>Neural logic programs and neural nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural-symbolic integration aims to combine the connectionist subsymbolic with the logical symbolic approach to artificial intelligence. In this paper, we first define the answer set semantics of (boolean) neural nets and then introduce from first principles a class of neural logic programs and show that nets and programs are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Data-Aware Hybrid Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labelled tableaux have been a traditional approach to define satisfiability checking procedures for Modal Logics. In many cases, they can also be used to obtained tight complexity bounds and lead to efficient implementations of reasoning tools. More recently, it has been shown that the expressive power provided by the operators characterizing Hybrid Logics (nominals and satisfiability modalities) can be used to internalize labels, leading to well-behaved inference procedures for fairly expressive logics. The resulting procedures are attractive because they do not use external mechanisms outside the language of the logic at hand, and have good logical and computational properties.
  Lately, many proof systems based on Hybrid Logic have been investigated, in particular related to Modal Logics featuring some form of data comparison.
  In this paper, we introduce an internalized tableaux calculus for XPath, arguably one of the most prominent approaches for querying semistructured data. More precisely, we define data-aware tableaux for XPath featuring data comparison operators and enriched with nominals and the satisfiability modalities from Hybrid Logic. We prove that the calculus is sound, complete and terminating. Moreover, we show that tableaux can be constructed in polynomial space, without compromising completeness, establishing in this way that the satisfiability problem for the considered logic is PSPACE-complete. Finally, we explore different extensions of the calculus, in particular to handle data trees and other frame classes.</description>

      <title>A Behavioral Theory for Distributed Systems with Weak Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed systems can be subject to various kinds of partial failures, therefore building fault-tolerance or failure mitigation mechanisms for distributed systems remains an important domain of research. In this paper, we present a calculus to formally model distributed systems subject to crash failures with recovery. The recovery model considered in the paper is weak, in the sense that it makes no assumption on the exact state in which a failed node resumes its execution, only its identity has to be distinguishable from past incarnations of itself. Our calculus is inspired in part by the Erlang programming language and in part by the distributed $\pi$-calculus with nodes and link failures (D$\pi$F) introduced by Francalanza and Hennessy. In order to reason about distributed systems with failures and recovery we develop a behavioral theory for our calculus, in the form of a contextual equivalence, and of a fully abstract coinductive characterization of this equivalence by means of a labelled transition system semantics and its associated weak bisimilarity. This result is valuable for it provides a compositional proof technique for proving or disproving contextual equivalence between systems.</description>

      <title>Conformance Checking of Fuzzy Logs against Declarative Temporal Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional conformance checking tasks assume that event data provide a faithful and complete representation of the actual process executions. This assumption has been recently questioned: more and more often events are not traced explicitly, but are instead indirectly obtained as the result of event recognition pipelines, and thus inherently come with uncertainty. In this work, differently from the typical probabilistic interpretation of uncertainty, we consider the relevant case where uncertainty refers to which activity is actually conducted, under a fuzzy semantics. In this novel setting, we consider the problem of checking whether fuzzy event data conform with declarative temporal rules specified as Declare patterns or, more generally, as formulae of linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf). This requires to relax the assumption that at each instant only one activity is executed, and to correspondingly redefine boolean operators of the logic with a fuzzy semantics. Specifically, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we define a fuzzy counterpart of LTLf tailored to our purpose. Second, we cast conformance checking over fuzzy logs as a verification problem in this logic. Third, we provide a proof-of-concept, efficient implementation based on the PyTorch Python library, suited to check conformance of multiple fuzzy traces at once.</description>

      <title>Invertible cells in $\omega$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study coinductive invertibility of cells in weak $\omega$-categories. We use the inductive presentation of weak $\omega$-categories via an adjunction with the category of computads, and show that invertible cells are closed under all operations of $\omega$-categories. Moreover, we give a simple criterion for invertibility in computads, together with an algorithm computing the data witnessing the invertibility, including the inverse, and the cancellation data.</description>

      <title>Discussion Graph Semantics of First-Order Logic with Equality for Reasoning about Discussion and Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate discussion graph semantics of first-order logic with equality for reasoning about discussion and argumentation as naturally as we would reason about sentences. While there are a few existing proposals to use a formal logic for reasoning about argumentation, they are constructed bottom-up and specialised to the argumentation model by Dung. There is indeed a conspicuous lack of a formal reasoning framework for handling general discussion and argumentation models. We achieve the generality through a top-down formulation of the semantics of first-order logic (with equality) formulas, addressing the current shortage.</description>

      <title>Transpension: The Right Adjoint to the Pi-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08533v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presheaf models of dependent type theory have been successfully applied to model HoTT, parametricity, and directed, guarded and nominal type theory. There has been considerable interest in internalizing aspects of these presheaf models, either to make the resulting language more expressive, or in order to carry out further reasoning internally, allowing greater abstraction and sometimes automated verification. While the constructions of presheaf models largely follow a common pattern, approaches towards internalization do not. Throughout the literature, various internal presheaf operators ($\surd$, $\Phi/\mathsf{extent}$, $\Psi/\mathsf{Gel}$, $\mathsf{Glue}$, $\mathsf{Weld}$, $\mathsf{mill}$, the strictness axiom and locally fresh names) can be found and little is known about their relative expressivenes. Moreover, some of these require that variables whose type is a shape (representable presheaf, e.g. an interval) be used affinely. We propose a novel type former, the transpension type, which is right adjoint to universal quantification over a shape. Its structure resembles a dependent version of the suspension type in HoTT. We give general typing rules and a presheaf semantics in terms of base category functors dubbed multipliers. Structural rules for shape variables and certain aspects of the transpension type depend on characteristics of the multiplier. We demonstrate how the transpension type and the strictness axiom can be combined to implement all and improve some of the aforementioned internalization operators (without formal claim in the case of locally fresh names).</description>

      <title>Hardness of monadic second-order formulae over succinct graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our main result is a succinct counterpoint to Courcelle's meta-theorem as follows: every arborescent monadic second-order (MSO) property is either NP-hard or coNP-hard over graphs given by succinct representations.  Succint representations are Boolean circuits computing the adjacency relation.  Arborescent properties are those which have infinitely many models and countermodels with bounded treewidth.  Moreover, we explore what happens when the arborescence condition is dropped and show that, under a reasonable complexity assumption, the previous dichotomy fails, even for questions expressible in first-order logic.</description>

      <title>Representing Knowledge and Querying Data using Double-Functorial Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Category theory offers a mathematical foundation for knowledge representation and database systems. Popular existing approaches model a database instance as a functor into the category of sets and functions, or as a 2-functor into the 2-category of sets, relations, and implications. The functional and relational models are unified by double functors into the double category of sets, functions, relations, and implications. In an accessible, example-driven style, we show that the abstract structure of a 'double category of relations' is a flexible and expressive language in which to represent knowledge, and we show how queries on data in the spirit of Codd's relational algebra are captured by double-functorial semantics.</description>

      <title>Provable Guarantees for Model Performance via Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose using mechanistic interpretability -- techniques for reverse engineering model weights into human-interpretable algorithms -- to derive and compactly prove formal guarantees on model performance. We prototype this approach by formally proving lower bounds on the accuracy of 151 small transformers trained on a Max-of-$K$ task. We create 102 different computer-assisted proof strategies and assess their length and tightness of bound on each of our models. Using quantitative metrics, we find that shorter proofs seem to require and provide more mechanistic understanding. Moreover, we find that more faithful mechanistic understanding leads to tighter performance bounds. We confirm these connections by qualitatively examining a subset of our proofs. Finally, we identify compounding structureless noise as a key challenge for using mechanistic interpretability to generate compact proofs on model performance.</description>
