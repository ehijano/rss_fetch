      <title>How to quantify an examination? Evidence from physics examinations via complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the untapped potential for continuous improvement of examinations, quantitative investigations of examinations could guide efforts to considerably improve learning efficiency and evaluation and thus greatly help both learners and educators. However, there is a general lack of quantitative methods for investigating examinations. To address this gap, we propose a new metric via complex networks; i.e., the knowledge point network (KPN) of an examination is constructed by representing the knowledge points (concepts, laws, etc.) as nodes and adding links when these points appear in the same question. Then, the topological quantities of KPNs, such as degree, centrality, and community, can be employed to systematically explore the structural properties and evolution of examinations. In this work, 35 physics examinations from the NCEE examination spanning from 2006 to 2020 were investigated as an evidence. We found that the constructed KPNs are scale-free networks that show strong assortativity and small-world effects in most cases. The communities within the KPNs are obvious, and the key nodes are mainly related to mechanics and electromagnetism. Different question types are related to specific knowledge points, leading to noticeable structural variations in KPNs. Moreover, changes in the KPN topology between examinations administered in different years may offer insights guiding college entrance examination reforms. Based on topological quantities such as the average degree, network density, average clustering coefficient, and network transitivity, the Fd is proposed to evaluate examination difficulty. All the above results show that our approach can comprehensively quantify the knowledge structures and examination characteristics. These networks may elucidate comprehensive examination knowledge graphs for educators and guide improvements in teaching.</description>

      <title>Double stochastic opinion dynamics with fractional inflow of new opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent analysis of empirical limit order flow data highlights the necessity for a more refined order flow model that integrates the power-law distribution of limit order cancellation times. These cancellation times follow a discrete probability mass function derived from the Tsallis $q$-exponential distribution, or equivalently, the second form of the Pareto distribution. By combining fractional L'{e}vy stable motion as the model for limit order inflow with the power-law distribution for cancellation times, we propose an innovative approach to modeling order imbalance in financial markets. We extend this model to a broader context, illustrating its applicability to opinion dynamics in social systems where opinions have a finite lifespan. This proposed model exemplifies a stochastic time series characterized by stationary increments and broken self-similarity. Consequently, it offers a novel framework for testing methods to evaluate long-range dependence in such time series.</description>

      <title>Mapping Inter-City Trade Networks to Maximum Entropy Models using Electronic Invoice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the network of transactions among cities based on the electronic invoice database for the municipalities in the Cear\'a state, Brazil. It consists of approximately 3.7 billion records, registered during the period between the years 2016 to 2019. All the transactions are grouped in a unique dataset and represented as an asymmetrical adjacency matrix corresponding to a directed graph with connections weighted by the number of transactions among cities. Due to the large size of Cear\'a state, its unequal distribution of wealth, and spatially heterogeneous population, we initially determine communities of cities based on their mutual intensity of trades and verify to which extent their economic interests reflect a community cohesiveness. For the first task, we use the Infomap algorithm to detect the partition which provides the shortest description length and captures the optimal community structure of the network in terms of its associated flow dynamics. Surprisingly, the partition identified has five modules, whose two-dimensional geographical projections are all simply-connected domains. We proceed with the analysis of traded products by building bipartite structures represented in terms of adjacency matrices between municipalities and products, considering selling and buying. Using the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) concept, we define a non-monetary and binary activity index that can distinguish the RCA of a city in a class of goods or services as evidenced by trade flows. Finally, through the pairwise Maximum Entropy Model, we can associate to the largest communities their corresponding binary Ising-like Hamiltonian models. In an analogy with critical phenomena, our results reveal that each community operates at a "temperature" that is close to the corresponding "critical point", suggesting a high degree of "economic cohesiveness" in its trade network of cities.</description>

      <title>Can nuclear energy contribute to the energy transition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the course of the energy transition, energy generation from nuclear power - through nuclear fission and perhaps in the future through nuclear fusion - is often proposed as an alternative or supplement to renewable energy sources. There are already good reasons why electricity generation from nuclear energy is significantly more expensive than other forms of generation, while increasing dryness as a result of climate change is generally calling into question the reliability of thermal power plants. Nuclear energy is therefore unlikely to play a role in a future energy supply that relies on low costs and reliability.</description>

      <title>U-Park: A User-Centric Smart Parking Recommendation System for Electric Shared Micromobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric Shared Micromobility Services (ESMS) has become a vital element within the Mobility as a Service framework, contributing to sustainable transportation systems. However, existing ESMS face notable design challenges such as shortcomings in integration, transparency, and user-centred approaches, resulting in increased operational costs and decreased service quality. A key operational issue for ESMS revolves around parking, particularly ensuring the availability of parking spaces as users approach their destinations. For instance, a recent study illustrated that nearly 13% of shared E-Bike users in Dublin, Ireland, encounter difficulties parking their E-Bikes due to inadequate planning and guidance. In response, we introduce U-Park, a user-centric smart parking recommendation system designed for ESMS, providing tailored recommendations to users by analysing their historical mobility data, trip trajectory, and parking space availability. We present the system architecture, implement it, and evaluate its performance using real-world data from an Irish-based shared E-Bike provider, MOBY Bikes. Our results illustrate U-Park's ability to predict a user's destination within a shared E-Bike system, achieving an approximate accuracy rate of over 97.60%, all without requiring direct user input. Experiments have proven that this predictive capability empowers U-Park to suggest the optimal parking station to users based on the availability of predicted parking spaces, improving the probability of obtaining a parking spot by 24.91% on average and 29.66% on maximum when parking availability is limited.</description>

      <title>Breathing Green: Maximising Health and Environmental Benefits for Active Transportation Users Leveraging Large Scale Air Quality Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pollution in urban areas can have significant adverse effects on the health and well-being of citizens, with traffic-related air pollution being a major concern in many cities. Pollutants emitted by vehicles, such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter, can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, particularly for vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. Furthermore, recent research has indicated that individuals living in more polluted areas are at a greater risk of developing chronic illnesses such as asthma, allergies, and cancer. Addressing these problems is crucial to protecting public health and maximising environmental benefits. In this project, we explore the feasibility of tackling this challenge by leveraging big data analysis and data-driven methods. Specifically, we investigate the recently released Google Air Quality dataset and devise an optimisation strategy to suggest green travel routes for different types of active transportation users in Dublin. To demonstrate our achievement, we have developed a prototype and have shown that citizens who use our model to plan their outdoor activities can benefit notably, with a significant decrease of 17.87% on average in pollutant intake, from the environmental advantages it offers.</description>

      <title>LGDE: Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for data-driven discovery of the semantic neighbourhood of words using tools from manifold learning and network science. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on a corpus of English-language hate speech-related posts from Reddit and Gab and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with significantly better performance than threshold methods based on direct word similarities. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.</description>

      <title>Lessons from a human-in-the-loop machine learning approach for identifying vacant, abandoned, and deteriorated properties in Savannah, Georgia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing strategies for managing vacant, abandoned, and deteriorated (VAD) properties is important for maintaining healthy communities. Yet, the process of identifying these properties can be difficult. Here, we create a human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITLML) model called VADecide and apply it to a parcel-level case study in Savannah, Georgia. The results show a higher prediction accuracy than was achieved when using a machine learning model without human input in the training. The HITLML approach also reveals differences between machine vs. human-generated results. Our findings contribute to knowledge about the advantages and challenges of HITLML in urban planning.
