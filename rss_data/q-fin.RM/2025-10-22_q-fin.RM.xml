      <title>A Natural Hedging Framework for Longevity Risk with Graphical Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural hedging allows life insurers to manage longevity risk internally by offsetting the opposite exposures of life insurance and annuity liabilities. Although many studies have proposed natural hedging strategies under different settings, calibration methods, and mortality models, a unified framework for constructing and evaluating such hedges remains undeveloped. While graphical risk assessment has been explored for index-based longevity hedges, no comparable metric exists for natural hedging. This paper proposes a structured natural hedging framework paired with a graphical risk metric for hedge evaluation. The framework integrates valuation, calibration, and evaluation, while the graphical metric provides intuitive insights into residual dependencies and hedge performance. Applied to multiple hedging scenarios, the proposed methods demonstrate flexibility, interpretability, and practical value for longevity risk management.</description>

      <title>Optimal allocations with distortion risk measures and mixed risk attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Pareto-optimal risk sharing in economies with heterogeneous attitudes toward risk, where agents' preferences are modeled by distortion risk measures. Building on comonotonic and counter-monotonic improvement results, we show that agents with similar attitudes optimally share risks comonotonically (risk-averse) or counter-monotonically (risk-seeking). We show how the general $n$-agent problem can be reduced to a two-agent formulation between representative risk-averse and risk-seeking agents, characterized by the infimal convolution of their distortion risk measures. Within this two-agent framework, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal allocations, and we identify when the infimal convolution yields an unbounded value. When existence fails, we analyze the problem under nonnegative allocation constraints, and we characterize optima explicitly, under piecewise-linear distortion functions and Bernoulli-type risks. Our findings suggest that the optimal allocation structure is governed by the relative strength of risk aversion versus risk seeking behavior, as intuition would suggest.</description>

      <title>Distributional regression for seasonal data: an application to river flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk assessment in casualty insurance, such as flood risk, traditionally relies on extreme-value methods that emphasizes rare events. These approaches are well-suited for characterizing tail risk, but do not capture the broader dynamics of environmental variables such as moderate or frequent loss events. To complement these methods, we propose a modelling framework for estimating the full (daily) distribution of environmental variables as a function of time, that is a distributional version of typical climatological summary statistics, thereby incorporating both seasonal variation and gradual long-term changes. Aside from the time trend, to capture seasonal variation our approach simultaneously estimates the distribution for each instant of the seasonal cycle, without explicitly modelling the temporal dependence present in the data. To do so, we adopt a framework inspired by GAMLSS (Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape), where the parameters of the distribution vary over the seasonal cycle as a function of explanatory variables depending only on the time of year, and not on the past values of the process under study. Ignoring the temporal dependence in the seasonal variation greatly simplifies the modelling but poses inference challenges that we clarify and overcome.
  We apply our framework to daily river flow data from three hydrometric stations along the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, and analyse the flood of the Fraser River in early winter of 2021.</description>

      <title>Elicitability and identifiability of tail risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tail risk measures are fully determined by the distribution of the underlying loss beyond its quantile at a certain level, with Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall and Range Value-at-Risk being prime examples. They are induced by law-based risk measures, called their generators, evaluated on the tail distribution. This paper establishes joint identifiability and elicitability results of tail risk measures together with the corresponding quantile, provided that their generators are identifiable and elicitable, respectively. As an example, we establish the joint identifiability and elicitability of the tail expectile together with the quantile. The corresponding consistent scores constitute a novel class of weighted scores, nesting the known class of scores of Fissler and Ziegel for the Expected Shortfall together with the quantile. For statistical purposes, our results pave the way to easier model fitting for tail risk measures via regression and the generalized method of moments, but also model comparison and model validation in terms of established backtesting procedures.</description>

      <title>Learning the Exact SABR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SABR model is a cornerstone of interest rate volatility modeling, but its practical application relies heavily on the analytical approximation by Hagan et al., whose accuracy deteriorates for high volatility, long maturities, and out-of-the-money options, admitting arbitrage. While machine learning approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often been limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation against the full spectrum of market conditions.
  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture that learns the true SABR stochastic dynamics using an unprecedented large training dataset (more than 200 million points) of interest rate Cap/Floor volatility surfaces, including very long maturities (30Y) and extreme strikes consistently with market quotations. Our dataset is obtained via high-precision unbiased Monte Carlo simulation of a special scaled shifted-SABR stochastic dynamics, which allows dimensional reduction without any loss of generality.
  Our SABR DNN provides arbitrage-free calibration of real market volatility surfaces and Cap/Floor prices for any maturity and strike with negligible computational effort and without retraining across business dates. Our results fully address the gaps in the previous machine learning SABR literature in a systematic and self-consistent way, and can be extended to cover any interest rate European options in different rate tenors and currencies, thus establishing a comprehensive functional SABR framework that can be adopted for daily trading and risk management activities.</description>
