      <title>Modelling the Stochastic Importation Dynamics and Establishment of Novel Pathogenic Strains using a General Branching Processes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importation and subsequent establishment of novel pathogenic strains in a population is subject to a large degree of uncertainty due to the stochastic nature of the disease dynamics. Mathematical models need to take this stochasticity in the early phase of an outbreak in order to adequately capture the uncertainty in disease forecasts. We propose a general branching process model of disease spread that includes host-level heterogeneity, and that can be straightforwardly tailored to capture the salient aspects of a particular disease outbreak. We combine this with a model of case importation that occurs via an independent marked Poisson process. We use this framework to investigate the impact of different control strategies, particularly on the time to establishment of an invading, exogenous strain, using parameters taken from the literature for COVID-19 as an example. We also demonstrate how to combine our model with a deterministic approximation, such that longer term projections can be generated that still incorporate the uncertainty from the early growth phase of the epidemic. Our approach produces meaningful short- and medium-term projections of the course of a disease outbreak when model parameters are still uncertain and when stochasticity still has a large effect on the population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interactions between eagles and semidomestic reindeer: lessons learned from field surveys and deterrents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predation by eagles on semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is an emerging human wildlife conflict in Fennoscandia. Both the Golden (Aquila chrysaetos) and the White-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) are believed by herders to predate on reindeer, however, there is a considerable knowledge gap regarding extent of predation and scavenging by each species, and their distribution and behaviour within the reindeer herding areas. Lethal and non-lethal methods have been suggested to reduce this conflict with eagles. We developed this project to fill the existing knowledge gaps by investigating the patterns of eagle abundance before, during, and after reindeer calving in a herding district in northern Sweden, and testing the effect of two potential deterrents (air ventilators and rotating prisms) in diverting eagles away from reindeer calving areas. During the single study period, we made 12, 47, and 17 eagle observations before, during, and after calving respectively. Out of these observations, 34 were of Golden eagles, 33 of White-tailed eagles, and for 9 observations the species could not be confirmed. Eagle abundance increased during calving and decreased again after calving ended. No attacks by eagles on calves were observed. The odds of observing eagles were significantly higher in the control area compared to areas with deterrents. More sub-adults were observed during calving, and both species were present in the area. The extent of predation was difficult to infer using direct observations and deterrents seem to show promise in diverting eagles away from calving grounds. These studies should be replicated to get a general picture of the issue and testing the efficiency of deterrents in diverting eagles away from reindeer across reindeer herding districts.</description>

      <title>An Interdisciplinary Perspective of the Built-Environment Microbiome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The built environment provides an excellent setting for interdisciplinary research on the dynamics of microbial communities. The system is simplified compared to many natural settings, and to some extent the entire environment can be manipulated, from architectural design, to materials use, air flow, human traffic, and capacity to disrupt microbial communities through cleaning. Here we provide an overview of the ecology of the microbiome in the built environment. We address niche space and refugia, population and community (metagenomic) dynamics, spatial ecology within a building, including the major microbial transmission mechanisms, as well as evolution. We also address the landscape ecology connecting microbiomes between physically separated buildings. At each stage we pay particular attention to the actual and potential interface between disciplines, such as ecology, epidemiology, materials science, and human social behavior. We end by identifying some opportunities for future interdisciplinary research on the microbiome of the built environment.</description>

      <title>Ambush strategy enhances organisms' performance in rock-paper-scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a five-species cyclic system wherein individuals of one species strategically adapt their movements to enhance their performance in the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. Environmental cues enable the awareness of the presence of organisms targeted for elimination in the cyclic game. If the local density of target organisms is sufficiently high, individuals move towards concentrated areas for direct attack; otherwise, they employ an ambush tactic, maximising the chances of success by targeting regions likely to be dominated by opponents. Running stochastic simulations, we discover that the ambush strategy enhances the likelihood of individual success compared to direct attacks alone, leading to uneven spatial patterns characterised by spiral waves. We compute the autocorrelation function and measure how the ambush tactic unbalances the organisms' spatial organisation by calculating the characteristic length scale of typical spatial domains of each species. We demonstrate that the threshold for local species density influences the ambush strategy's effectiveness, while the neighbourhood perception range significantly impacts decision-making accuracy. The outcomes show that long-range perception improves performance by over 60\%, although there is potential interference in decision-making under high attack triggers. Understanding how organisms' adaptation to their environment enhances their performance may be helpful not only for ecologists but also for data scientists aiming to improve artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics and games of variable size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the concept of Variable Size Game Theory (VSGT), in which the number of players in a game is a strategic decision made by the players themselves. We start by discussing the main examples in game theory: dominance, coexistence, and coordination. We show that the same set of pay-offs can result in coordination-like or coexistence-like games depending on the strategic decision of each player type. We also solve an inverse problem to find a $d$-player game that reproduces the same fixation pattern of the VSGT. In the sequel, we consider a game involving prosocial and antisocial players, i.e., individuals who tend to play with large groups and small groups, respectively. In this game, a certain task should be performed, that will benefit one of the participants at the expense of the other players. We show that individuals able to gather large groups to perform the task may prevail, even if this task is costly, providing a possible scenario for the evolution of eusociality. The next example shows that different strategies regarding game size may lead to spontaneous separation of different types, a possible scenario for speciation without physical separation (sympatric speciation). In the last example, we generalize to three types of populations from the previous analysis and study compartmental epidemic models: in particular, we recast the SIRS model into the VSGT framework: Susceptibles play 2-player games, while Infectious and Removed play a 1-player game. The SIRS epidemic model is then obtained as the replicator equation of the VSGT. We finish with possible applications of VSGT to be addressed in the future.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of two-compartment models with regulatory mechanisms for hematopoiesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic analysis of a stochastic two-compartmental cell proliferation system with regulatory mechanisms. We model the system as a state-dependent birth and death process. Proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is regulated by population density of HSC-derived clones and differentiation of HSC is regulated by population density of HSCs. By scaling up the initial population, we show the density of dynamics converges in distribution to the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The system of ODEs has a unique non-trivial equilibrium that is globally stable. Furthermore, we show the scaled fluctuation of the population converges in law to a linear diffusion with time-dependent coefficients. With initial data being Gaussian, the limit is a Gauss-Markov process, and it behaves like the FCLT limit under equilibrium with constant coefficients at large times. This is proved by establishing exponential convergence in the 2-Wasserstein metric for the associated Gaussian measures in a $\mathcal{L}_2$ Hilbert space. We apply our results to analyze and compare two regulatory mechanisms in the hematopoietic system. Simulations are conducted to verify our large-scale and long-time approximation of the dynamics. We demonstrate some regulatory mechanisms are efficient (converge to steady state rapidly) but not effective (have large fluctuation around the steady state).</description>

      <title>Infection-induced Cascading Failures -- Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of epidemic spreading, many intricate dynamical patterns can emerge due to the cooperation of different types of pathogens or the interaction between the disease spread and other failure propagation mechanism. To unravel such patterns, simulation frameworks are usually adopted, but they are computationally demanding on big networks and subject to large statistical uncertainty. Here, we study the two-layer spreading processes on unidirectionally dependent networks, where the spreading infection of diseases or malware in one layer can trigger cascading failures in another layer and lead to secondary disasters, e.g., disrupting public services, supply chains, or power distribution. We utilize a dynamic message-passing method to devise efficient algorithms for inferring the system states, which allows one to investigate systematically the nature of complex intertwined spreading processes and evaluate their impact. Based on such dynamic message-passing framework and optimal control, we further develop an effective optimization algorithm for mitigating network failures.</description>

      <title>Cousins Of The Vendi Score: A Family Of Similarity-Based Diversity Metrics For Science And Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring diversity accurately is important for many scientific fields, including machine learning (ML), ecology, and chemistry. The Vendi Score was introduced as a generic similarity-based diversity metric that extends the Hill number of order q=1 by leveraging ideas from quantum statistical mechanics. Contrary to many diversity metrics in ecology, the Vendi Score accounts for similarity and does not require knowledge of the prevalence of the categories in the collection to be evaluated for diversity. However, the Vendi Score treats each item in a given collection with a level of sensitivity proportional to the item's prevalence. This is undesirable in settings where there is a significant imbalance in item prevalence. In this paper, we extend the other Hill numbers using similarity to provide flexibility in allocating sensitivity to rare or common items. This leads to a family of diversity metrics -- Vendi scores with different levels of sensitivity -- that can be used in a variety of applications. We study the properties of the scores in a synthetic controlled setting where the ground truth diversity is known. We then test their utility in improving molecular simulations via Vendi Sampling. Finally, we use the Vendi scores to better understand the behavior of image generative models in terms of memorization, duplication, diversity, and sample quality.</description>

      <title>An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.</description>
