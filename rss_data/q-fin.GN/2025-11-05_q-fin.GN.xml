      <title>Overprocurement of balancing capacity may increase the welfare in the cross-zonal energy-reserve coallocation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the traded energy and reserve products between zones are co-allocated to optimize the infrastructure usage, both deterministic and stochastic flows have to be accounted for on interconnector lines. We focus on allocation models, which guarantee deliverability in the context of the portfolio bidding European day-ahead market framework, assuming a flow-based description of network constraints. In such models, as each unit of allocated reserve supply implies additional cost, it is straightforward to assume that the amount of allocated reserve is equal to the accepted reserve demand quantity. However, as it is illustrated by the proposed work, overprocurement of reserves may imply counterintuitive benefits. Reserve supplies not used for balancing may be used for congestion management, thus allowing valuable additional flows in the network.</description>

      <title>How FinTech affects financial sustainability: Evidence from Chinese commercial banks using a three-stage network DEA-Malmquist model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of financial technology (FinTech) on the financial sustainability (FS) of commercial banks. We employ a three-stage network DEA-Malmquist model to evaluate the FS performance of 104 Chinese commercial banks from 2015 to 2023. A two-way fixed effects model is utilized to examine the effects of FinTech on FS, revealing a significant negative relationship. Further mechanistic analysis indicates that FinTech primarily undermines FS by eroding banks' loan efficiency and profitability. Notably, banks with more patents or listed status demonstrate greater resilience to FinTech disruptions. These findings help banks identify external risks stemming from FinTech development, and by elucidating the mechanisms underlying FS, enhance their capacity to monitor and manage FS in the era of rapid FinTech advancement.</description>
