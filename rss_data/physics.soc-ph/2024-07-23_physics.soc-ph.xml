      <title>A Review on Response Strategies in Infrastructure Network Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the literature on response strategies for restoring infrastructure networks in the aftermath of a disaster. Our motivation for this review is twofold. First, the frequency and magnitude of natural and man-made disasters (e.g., wild fires, tornadoes, global pandemics, terrorist attacks) have been increasing. These events disrupt the operation of infrastructure networks, preventing the delivery of vital goods and services such as power and food. Therefore, it is critical to understand the state-of-the-art in responding to network disruptions in order to develop efficient strategies to mitigate their impacts. Second, it is critical to enable timely decisions in a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment while accounting for numerous interrelated factors. Because the vast majority of response decision problems are computationally challenging, quickly finding solutions that are compatible with real-time decision making is a difficult task. Hence, it is important to understand the nature of response activities and decisions, as well as the available solution methodologies and inherent trade-offs between computation time and solution quality. We review quantitative response methodologies developed for infrastructure network restoration, classifying relevant studies based on the properties of the underlying network. In particular, we focus on resource allocation, scheduling, routing and repair efforts within the domain of power, road, and water, oil and gas network restoration. We also discuss open research questions and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Small but not least changes: The Art of Creating Disruptive Innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, product innovation thrives on replacing outdated technologies with groundbreaking ones or through the ingenious recombination of existing technologies. Our study embarks on a revolutionary journey by genetically representing products, extracting their chromosomal data, and constructing a comprehensive phylogenetic network of automobiles. We delve deep into the technological features that shape innovation, pinpointing the ancestral roots of products and mapping out intricate product-family triangles. By leveraging the similarities within these triangles, we introduce a pioneering "Product Disruption Index"-inspired by the CD index (Funk and Owen-Smith, 2017)-to quantify a product's disruptiveness. Our approach is rigorously validated against the scientifically recognized trend of decreasing disruptiveness over time (Park et al., 2023) and through compelling case studies. Our statistical analysis reveals a fascinating insight: disruptive product innovations often stem from minor, yet crucial, modifications.</description>

      <title>Mitigating biases in big mobility data: a case study of monitoring large-scale transit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big mobility datasets (BMD) have shown many advantages in studying human mobility and evaluating the performance of transportation systems. However, the quality of BMD remains poorly understood. This study evaluates biases in BMD and develops mitigation methods. Using Google and Apple mobility data as examples, this study compares them with benchmark data from governmental agencies. Spatio-temporal discrepancies between BMD and benchmark are observed and their impacts on transportation applications are investigated, emphasizing the urgent need to address these biases to prevent misguided policymaking. This study further proposes and tests a bias mitigation method. It is shown that the mitigated BMD could generate valuable insights into large-scale public transit systems across 100+ US counties, revealing regional disparities of the recovery of transit systems from the COVID-19. This study underscores the importance of caution when using BMD in transportation research and presents effective mitigation strategies that would benefit practitioners.</description>

      <title>The Ethical Aspects of Choosing a Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we addressed the problem of choosing a nuclear fuel cycle. Ethical problems related to the choice of a nuclear fuel cycle, such as the depletion of natural uranium reserves, the accumulation of nuclear waste, and the connection with the problems of nonidentity and distributive justice are considered. We examined cultural differences in attitudes toward nuclear safety and the associated ambiguities in the choice of a nuclear fuel cycle. We suggested that the reduction in consumption of natural uranium does not seem to be a feasible way of reducing nuclear waste because of the nonidentity problem.</description>

      <title>Astronomy's relationship with the lands and communities of Maunakea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomy is at a turning point in its history and in its relations with the Indigenous peoples who are the generational stewards of land where several of our main observatories are located. The controversy regarding the further development of astronomy facilities on Maunakea is probably the most significant and publicized conflict about the use of such land in the name of science. Thousands have stood in resistance, elders were arrested, and the community is divided. Astronomy's access to one of its most emblematic sites is at risk. This situation challenges our professional practice, the projects we build on Indigenous lands, and our relationships with the people who live within these lands and with society in general. This paper attempts to share the perspective of the authors on the historical events, including the very recent past, through the lens of our understanding and opinions; to provide transparency, with humility, into our process of introspection and transformation; and to share our hopes and ambitions as leaders from Maunakea Observatories for the future of astronomy in Hawai'i, as advocated by the Astro2020 report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; and to suggest ways for the profession to commit to this long-term vision.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effects of natural disasters, wars, and migrations on sustainability or collapse of pre-industrial societies: Random perturbations of the Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of random perturbations in the Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY) model. HANDY models the interactions between human population, depletion, and consumption of natural resources. HANDY explains how endogenous human--nature interactions could lead to sustainability or collapse in past societies. We introduce a Gaussian random noise perturbation on the population change to represent generic external perturbations. The robustness of the results is investigated with statistical analysis based on probability distributions of specific events. Our study shows that the results of the unperturbed HANDY model are robust under small perturbations of $\lesssim$ 10\% of the Human population. Our results confirm that endogenous dynamics drive the societal cycles. However, exogenous perturbations, such as floods, droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, infectious disease, epidemics, and wars, can accelerate or delay a collapse cycle.</description>

      <title>Multifractal analysis of racially-constrained population patterns and residential segregation in the US cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phenomenon of racial segregation in U.S. cities is a multifaceted area of study. A recent advancement in this field is the development of a methodology that transforms census population count-by-race data into a grid of monoracial cells. This format enables assessment of heterogeneity of segregation within a city. This paper leverages such a grid for the quantification of race-constrained population patterns, allowing for the calculation and mapping of binary segregation patterns within arbitrary region. A key innovation is the application of Multifractal Analysis (MFA) to quantify the residency patterns of race-constrained populations. The residency pattern is characterized by a multifractal spectrum function, where the independent variable is a local metric of pattern's "gappiness", and the dependent variable is proportional to the size of the sub-pattern consisting of all locations having the same value of this metric. In the context of binary populations, the gappiness of the race-constrained population's pattern is intrinsically linked to its segregation. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the methodology, illustrated with examples focusing on the residency pattern of Black population in the central region of Washington, DC. Further, the methodology is demonstrated using a sample of residency patterns of Black population in fourteen large U.S. cities. By numerically describing each pattern through a multifractal spectrum, the fourteen patterns are clustered into three distinct categories, each having unique characteristics. Maps of local gappiness and segregation for each city are provided to show the connection between the nature of the multifractal spectrum and the corresponding residency and segregation patterns. This method offers an excellent quantification of race-restricted residency and residential segregation patterns within U.S. cities.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-based Driver Risk-Aware Intelligent Mobility Analytics for Urban Transportation Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional mobility management strategies emphasize macro-level mobility oversight from traffic-sensing infrastructures, often overlooking safety risks that directly affect road users. To address this, we propose a Digital Twin-based Driver Risk-Aware Intelligent Mobility Analytics (DT-DIMA) system. The DT-DIMA system integrates real-time traffic information from pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), synchronizes this data into a digital twin to accurately replicate the physical world, and predicts network-wide mobility and safety risks in real time. The system's innovation lies in its integration of spatial-temporal modeling, simulation, and online control modules. Tested and evaluated under normal traffic conditions and incidental situations (e.g., unexpected accidents, pre-planned work zones) in a simulated testbed in Brooklyn, New York, DT-DIMA demonstrated mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) ranging from 8.40% to 15.11% in estimating network-level traffic volume and MAPEs from 0.85% to 12.97% in network-level safety risk prediction. In addition, the highly accurate safety risk prediction enables PTCs to preemptively monitor road segments with high driving risks before incidents take place. Such proactive PTC surveillance creates around a 5-minute lead time in capturing traffic incidents. The DT-DIMA system enables transportation managers to understand mobility not only in terms of traffic patterns but also driver-experienced safety risks, allowing for proactive resource allocation in response to various traffic situations. To the authors' best knowledge, DT-DIMA is the first urban mobility management system that considers both mobility and safety risks based on digital twin architecture.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Optimizes Power Dispatch in Decentralized Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective frequency control in power grids has become increasingly important with the increasing demand for renewable energy sources. Here, we propose a novel strategy for resolving this challenge using graph convolutional proximal policy optimization (GC-PPO). The GC-PPO method can optimally determine how much power individual buses dispatch to reduce frequency fluctuations across a power grid. We demonstrate its efficacy in controlling disturbances by applying the GC-PPO to the power grid of the UK. The performance of GC-PPO is outstanding compared to the classical methods. This result highlights the promising role of GC-PPO in enhancing the stability and reliability of power systems by switching lines or decentralizing grid topology.</description>

      <title>Hurricane Evacuation Analysis with Large-scale Mobile Device Location Data during Hurricane Ian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hurricane Ian is the deadliest and costliest hurricane in Florida's history, with 2.5 million people ordered to evacuate. As we witness increasingly severe hurricanes in the context of climate change, mobile device location data offers an unprecedented opportunity to study hurricane evacuation behaviors. With a terabyte-level GPS dataset, we introduce a holistic hurricane evacuation behavior algorithm with a case study of Ian: we infer evacuees' departure time and categorize them into different behavioral groups, including self, voluntary, mandatory, shadow and in-zone evacuees. Results show the landfall area (Fort Myers, Lee County) had lower out-of-zone but higher overall evacuation rate, while the predicted landfall area (Tampa, Hillsborough County) had the opposite, suggesting the effects of delayed evacuation order. Out-of-zone evacuation rates would increase from shore to inland. Spatiotemporal analysis identified three evacuation waves: during formation, before landfall, and after landfall. These insights are valuable for enhancing future disaster planning and management.</description>

      <title>Information cascade on networks and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein, we consider a voting model for information cascades on several types of networks -- a random graph, the Barab\'{a}si-Albert(BA) model, and lattice networks -- by using one parameter $\omega$; $\omega=1,0, -1$ respectively correspond to these networks. $\omega$ is related to the size of hubs. We discuss the differences between the phases in which the networks depend. In $\omega\ne -1$, without, the following two types of phase transitions can be observed: information cascade transition and super-normal transition. The first is the transition between a state where most voters make correct choices and a state where most of them are wrong. This is an absorption transition that belongs to the non-equilibrium transition. In the symmetric case, the phase transition is continuous and the universality class is the same as nonlinear P\'{o}lya model. In contrast, in the asymmetric case, there is a discontinuous phase transition, where the gap depends on the network. The super-normal transition is the transition of the convergence speed, and the critical point of the convergence speed transition depends on $\omega$. At $\omega=1$, in the BA model, this transition disappears. Both phase transitions disappear at $\omega=-1$ in the lattice case. In conclusion, as the performance near the lattice case, $\omega\sim-1$ exhibits the best performance of the voting in all networks. As the hub size decreases, the performance improves.</description>

      <title>Broken detailed balance and entropy production in directed networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the the degree to which a network is directed and hierarchically organised is closely associated with the degree to which its dynamics break detailed balance and produce entropy. We consider a range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features affect their entropy production rate. We begin with an analytical treatment of a 2-node network followed by numerical simulations of synthetic networks using the preferential attachment and Erd\"os-Renyi algorithms. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks to determine the effect of complex real-world topologies. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium dynamics and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the consequences of directed network structure on non-equilibrium dynamics and highlight the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay of network structure and talent configuration on wealth dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The economic success of individuals is often determined by a combination of talent, luck, and assistance from others. We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as ``talent configuration effect", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale-free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role. Our findings address that high socioeconomic homophily can create a dilemma between growth and equality, and that hub monopolization by few highly talented agents makes economic growth strongly dependent on their performances.</description>

      <title>Price of information in games of chance: a statistical physics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information in the form of data, which can be stored and transferred between users, can be viewed as an intangible commodity, which can be traded in exchange for money. Determining the fair price at which a string of data should be traded is an important and open problem in many settings. In this work we develop a statistical physics framework that allows to determine analytically the fair price of information exchanged between players in a game of chance. For definiteness, we consider a game where $N$ players bet on the binary outcome of a stochastic process and share the entry fees pot if successful. We assume that one player holds information about past outcomes of the game, which they may either use exclusively to improve their betting strategy or offer to sell to another player. We find a sharp transition as the number of players $N$ is tuned across a critical value, between a phase where the transaction is always profitable for the seller and one where it may not be. In both phases, different regimes are possible, depending on the "quality" of information being put up for sale: we observe symbiotic regimes, where both parties collude effectively to rig the game in their favor, competitive regimes, where the transaction is unappealing to the data holder as it overly favors a competitor for scarce resources, and even prey-predator regimes, where an exploitative data holder could be giving away bad-quality data to undercut a competitor. Our analytical framework can be generalized to more complex settings and constitutes a flexible tool to address the rich and timely problem of pricing information in games of chance.</description>

Abstract: Urban road transport is a major civilisational and economic challenge, affecting the quality of life and economic activity. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach and sustainable urban planning strategies to mitigate the negative effects of traffic in cities. In this paper, we introduce an extension of one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation models, the Payne-Whitham model. We investigate how this model, originally designed to model highway traffic on straight road segments, can be adapted to more realistic conditions with arbitrary road network graphs and multiple intersections with traffic signals. Furthermore, we showcase the practical application of this extension in experiments aimed at optimising traffic signal settings. For computational reasons, these experiments involve the adoption of surrogate models for approximating our extended Payne-Whitham model, and subsequently, we utilise the Differential Evolution optimization algorithm, resulting in the identification of traffic signal settings that enhance the average speed of cars and decrease the total length of queues, thereby facilitating smoother traffic flow.</description>

Abstract: Decline of immunity is a phenomenon characterized by immunocompromised host and plays a crucial role in the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose an age-structured model with vaccination and reinfection of immune individuals. We prove that the disease-free equilibrium of the model undergoes backward and forward transcritical bifurcations at the critical value of the basic reproduction number for different values of parameters. We illustrate the results by numerical computations, and also find that the endemic equilibrium exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation on the extended branch of the forward transcritical bifurcation. These results allow us to understand the interplay between the decline of immunity and EIDs, and are able to provide strategies for mitigating the impact of EIDs on global health.</description>
