      <title>Deciphering Solar Magnetic Activity: Some (Unpopular) Thoughts On the Coupling of the Sun's "Weather" and "Climate"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun exhibits episodic surges of magnetic activity across a range of temporal and spatial scales, the most prominent of which is the 11-ish year modulation of sunspot production. Beside the ~170 (min to max) decadal variation in sunspot production there is a less-explored quasi-annual variation in the range of 25-50 sunspots/year in magnitude. In addition, there is there is a slower, ~80 year period, 10-50 variation in the sunspot number, that is commonly referred to as the 'Gleissberg Cycle.' Using a suite of contemporary and historical observations we will illustrate these elements of our star's episodic behavior and present a hypothesis that may provide a consistent physical link between the observed 'climatic', 'decadal' and 'seasonal' magnetic variation of our star.</description>

      <title>CMFGEN grids of atmosphere models for massive stars: OB-type stars at the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large spectroscopic surveys of individual massive stars, such as ULLYSES and XSHOOTU, provide observational data for hundreds of massive stars. Their analysis requires large numbers of synthetic spectra so that stellar parameters can be determined. In addition, libraries of massive stars' spectra are needed to produce population synthesis models able to reproduce the observed spectra of unresolved young stellar populations, such as those revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the early Universe. Our main goal is to provide an extensive library of synthetic spectra and spectral energy distributions of OB stars at metallicities of the Magellanic Clouds. This library will offer a wealth of spectrophotometric information, making it readily applicable to a variety of astrophysical problems. We used the CMFGEN code to calculate 606 NLTE, line-blanketed, expanding atmosphere models using a comprehensive set of atomic data. An overall metallicity of 1/2 Z$_\odot$ and 1/5 Z$_\odot$ was adopted for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), respectively. We produced high-resolution spectra from 30 angstroms to 3 $\mu$m for stars on the Main Sequence and slightly beyond. We provide spectral energy distributions, normalized synthetic spectra, ionizing fluxes, and photometry in various bands: Johnson UBV, Cousins RI, Bessel JHK, selected wide JWST filters, Gaia, and LSST ugrizy filters. For each of these filters, we compute bolometric corrections for all synthetic spectra and calibrations as a function of effective temperature. All of our synthetic spectra are publicly available through the POLLUX database, aiming to expedite multiwavelength analyses of massive stars in low metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>Compression Acceleration of Protons and Heavier Ions at the Heliospheric Current Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) suggest that protons and heavier ions are accelerated to high energies by magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). By solving the energetic particle transport equation in large-scale MHD simulations, we study the compression acceleration of protons and heavier ions in the reconnecting HCS. We find that the acceleration of multi-species ions results in nonthermal power-law distributions with spectral index consistent with the PSP observations. Our study shows that the high-energy cutoff of protons can reach $E_{max} \sim 0.1$ - $1$ MeV depending on the particle diffusion coefficients. We also study how the high-energy cutoff of different ion species scales with the charge-to-mass ratio $E_{max} \propto (Q/M)^\alpha$. When determining the diffusion coefficients from the quasilinear theory with a Kolmogorov magnetic power spectrum, we find that $\alpha \sim 0.4$, which is somewhat smaller than $\alpha \sim 0.7$ observed by PSP.</description>

      <title>Can we rely on EUV emission to identify coronal waveguides?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional models of coronal oscillations rely on modelling the coronal structures that support them as compact cylindrical waveguides. Recently, an alternative model of the structure of the corona has been proposed, where the thin strand-like coronal loops observable in the EUV emission are a result of line-of-sight integration of warps in more complex coronal structures, referred to as the coronal veil model. We extend the implications of the coronal veil model of the solar corona to models of coronal oscillations. Using the convection-zone-to-corona simulations with the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost, we analysed the structure of the self-consistently formed simulated corona. We focus on the spatial variability of the volumetric emissivity of the Fe IX 171.073 {\AA} EUV line, and on the variability of the Alfv\'en speed, which captures the density and magnetic structuring of the simulated corona. We traced features associated with large magnitudes of the Alfv\'en speed gradient, which are the most likely to trap MHD waves and act as coronal waveguides, and looked for the correspondence with emitting regions which appear as strand-like loops in line-of-sight-integrated EUV emission. The waveguide filling factors corresponding to the fraction of the waveguides filled with plasma emitting in the given EUV wavelength range from 0.09 to 0.44. This suggests that we can observe only a small fraction of the waveguide. Similarly, the projected waveguide widths in the plane of the sky are several times larger than the widths of the apparent loops observable in EUV. We conclude that the 'coronal veil' structure is model-independent. As a result, we find a lack of straightforward correspondence between a peak in the integrated emission profile which constitutes an apparent coronal loop and regions of plasma bound by a large Alfv\'en speed gradient acting as waveguides.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Atmospheric Parameters of Early-type Stars from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) Slitless Spectra Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of atmospheric parameters is fundamental for scientific research using stellar spectra. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), scheduled to be launched in 2024, will provide researchers with hundreds of millions of slitless spectra for stars during a 10 yr survey. And machine learning has unparalleled efficiency in processing large amounts of data compared to manual processing. Here we studied the stellar parameters of early-type stars (effective temperature Teff more than 15,000 K) based on the design indicators of the CSST slitless spectrum and the machine learning algorithm, Stellar LAbel Machine. We used the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (POWR) synthetic spectra library for cross validation. Then we tested the reliability of machine learning results by using the Next Generation Spectrum Library (NGSL) from Hubble Space Telescope observation data. We use the spectra with the impact of interstellar extinction (AV = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mag) and radial velocity (RV = -50, -30, 0, 30, 50 km s-1) from the POWR library as the test set. When RV = 0 km s-1 and AV = 0 mag, the average value and standard deviation for 3 wavelength ranges (2550-4050 Ang (R = 287); 4050-6300 Ang (R = 232); 6300-10000 Ang (R = 207)) are -66 K, 550 K, and 356 K for Teff, and 0.004 c.g.s, -0.024 c.g.s, and 0.01 c.g.s for log g. When using the observed data from NGSL as the testing samples, the deviation of Teff is less than 5%, and the deviation of log g is less than 11%. In addition, we also test the influence of shifting of spectra on the parameters accuracy. The deviation of Teff for the case with a shift of 5 Ang and 10 Ang are 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively; the deviation of log g are 4.2% and 5.1%. These results demonstrate that we can obtain relatively accurate stellar parameters of a population of early-type stars with the CSST slitless spectra and a machine-learning method.</description>

      <title>Flare heating of the chromosphere: Observations of flare continuum from GREGOR and IRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: On 2022 May 4, an M5.7 flare erupted in the active region NOAA 13004, which was the target of a coordinated campaign between GREGOR, IRIS, Hinode, and ground-based instruments at the Ond\v{r}ejov observatory. A flare kernel located at the edge of a pore was co-observed by the IRIS slit and GREGOR HiFI+ imagers. Aims: We investigated the flare continuum enhancement at different wavelength ranges in order to derive the temperature of the chromospheric layer heated during the flare. Methods: All datasets were aligned to IRIS slit-jaw images. We selected a pixel along the IRIS slit where the flare kernel was captured and evaluated multi-wavelength light curves within it. We defined a narrow IRIS near-UV band that comprises only continuum emission. The method, which assumes that the flare continuum enhancement is due to optically thin emission from hydrogen recombination processes, was applied to obtain a lower limit on the temperature in the layer where the continuum enhancement was formed. Results: We determined a lower limit for the temperature and its time evolution in the chromospheric layer heated during the flare in the range of (3-15).10^3 K. The mean electron density in that layer was estimated to be about 1.10^(13) cm^(-3). Conclusions: Multi-wavelength flare co-observations are a rich source of diagnostics. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of flares, the sit-and-stare mode is key to achieving a high temporal cadence that allows one to thoroughly analyse the same flare structure.</description>

      <title>Discovery of double stars by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in 1654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been generally accepted that the originators of the double star astronomy were Christian Mayer and William Herschel. We recovered the memory of the poorly known Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna, who published the first catalogue of stellar binaries over a century before Mayer and Herschel. We analysed the fourth section of 1654 G. B. Hodierna's book "De systemate orbis cometici deque admirandis coeli characteribus". There, Hodierna listed a dozen pairs of stars whose identification with modern star names had been lost for centuries. To identify the pairs, we used Hodierna's Latin descriptions of location in constellations for all primary stars, ecliptic coordinates and angular separations to companions for some, and the Washington Double Star, Hipparcos, and Gaia catalogues. We were able to identify the twelve primaries and eleven multiple systems with companions, of which nine were double and two were triple. Besides, with up-to-date data, we confirmed that four systems are physically bound: Atlas and Pleione, alpha1,2 Lib, nu1,2 Dra, and theta1 Ori A, C, and D. The other seven pairs are alignments of very bright stars at different distances.</description>

      <title>YSO Jets Magnetocentrifugally Driven by Reconnecting Atmospheric Avalanche Accretion Streams Above Inner Circumstellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, collimated jets are ubiquitous features of young stellar objects (YSOs). They are generally thought to be powered by disk accretion, but the details are debated. Through 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations, we find that a fast ($&gt;100$~km/s) collimated bipolar jet is continuously driven along the north and south poles of the circumstellar disk that is initially magnetized by a large-scale open poloidal field and contains a thermally ionized inner magnetically active zone surrounded by a dead zone. The fast jet is primarily driven magneto-centrifugally by the release of the gravitational binding energy of the so-called ``avalanche accretion streams" near the boundary of an evacuated poloidal field-dominated polar region and a thick disk atmosphere raised by a toroidal magnetic field. Specifically, the fast outflow is driven along the upper (open) branch of the highly pinched poloidal field lines threading the (strongly magnetically braked) accretion streams where the density is relatively low so that the lightly loaded material can be accelerated magneto-centrifugally along the open field line to a high speed. The highly pinched poloidal magnetic fields threading the avalanche accretion streams tend to reconnect, enabling mass to accrete to the center without dragging along the poloidal magnetic flux with it. The reconnection provides a potential heating source for producing chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs).</description>

      <title>Local two-dimensional simulations of the ignition of a helium shell detonation on a white dwarf by an impacting stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Constraining Extra Mixing during the Main Sequence: What Depletes Lithium Does Not Touch Beryllium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of lithium abundances in solar-type stars have shown that standard models of stellar evolution are incapable of explaining the observed depletion as a function of stellar age. Beryllium is one of the lightest elements that can be measured in stellar photospheres, and it can be burned in relatively low temperatures. Studying its abundances as a function of stellar age can provide important constraints to stellar mixing models, as the level of depletion as a function of time will indicate how deep the photospheric material must be dredged to explain the observed abundances of both elements. In an effort to provide the most stringent constraints for non-standard stellar mixing models, we observed a sample of solar-twins and concomitantly analyzed their lithium and beryllium abundances. Unlike what is typically observed for lithium, we find that beryllium does not decrease as a function of stellar age, constraining models that predict burning of both materials. Based on our data, models that invoke convective overshoot and convective settling are preferred over typical rotationaly-induced mixing models, as the later burn Be in excess while the former do not. Previous works also proposed mixing due to gravity waves as a possible explanation for observed abundances, which can fit our data as well. We also confirm previous finds of an increase in Be abundance as a function of metallicity, indicative of galactic production via cosmic ray spallation.</description>

      <title>An FUV-detected Accretion Shock at the Star-Disk Boundary of FU Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FU Ori objects are the most extreme eruptive young stars known. Their 4 to 5 magnitude photometric outbursts last for decades and are attributed to a factor of up to 10,000 increase in the stellar accretion rate. The nature of the accretion disk-to-star interface in FU Ori objects has remained a mystery for decades. To date, attempts to directly observe a shock or boundary layer have been thwarted by the apparent lack of emission in excess of the accretion disk photosphere down to $\lambda = 2300$ \AA. We present a new NUV and the first high-sensitivity FUV spectrum of FU Ori. The FUV continuum is detected for the first time and, at $\lambda = 1400$ \AA, is more than $10^4$ times brighter than predicted by a viscous accretion disk. We interpret the excess as arising from a shock at the boundary between the disk and the stellar surface. We model the shock emission as a blackbody and find that the temperature of the shocked material is $T_\mathrm{FUV} \approx 16,000 \pm 2000$ K. The shock temperature corresponds to an accretion flow along the surface of the disk that reaches a velocity of 40 km s$^{-1}$ at the boundary, consistent with predictions from simulations.</description>

      <title>RV measurements of directly imaged brown dwarf GQ Lup B to search for exo-satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GQ Lup B is one of the few substellar companions with a detected cicumplanetary disk, or CPD. Observations of the CPD suggest the presence of a cavity, possibly formed by an exo-satellite. Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC), a high contrast imaging suite that feeds a high resolution spectrograph (1.9-2.5 microns, R$\sim$35,000), we present the first dedicated radial velocity (RV) observations around a high-contrast, directly imaged substellar companion, GQ Lup B, to search for exo-satellites. Over 11 epochs, we find a best and median RV error of 400-1000 m/s, most likely limited by systematic fringing in the spectra due to transmissive optics within KPIC. With this RV precision, KPIC is sensitive to exomoons 0.6-2.8% the mass of GQ Lup B ($\sim 30 M_{\text{Jup}}$) at separations between the Roche limit and $65 R_{\text{Jup}}$, or the extent of the cavity inferred within the CPD detected around GQ Lup B. Using simulations of HISPEC, a high resolution infrared spectrograph planned to debut at W.M. Keck Observatory in 2026, we estimate future exomoon sensitivity to increase by over an order of magnitude, providing sensitivity to less massive satellites potentially formed within the CPD itself. Additionally, we run simulations to estimate the amount of material that different masses of satellites could clear in a CPD to create the observed cavity. We find satellite-to-planet mass ratios of $q &gt; 2 \times 10^{-4}$ can create observable cavities and report a maximum cavity size of $\sim 51 \, R_{\text{Jup}}$ carved from a satellite.</description>

      <title>ExoTiC-LD: thirty seconds to stellar limb-darkening coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar limb darkening is the observed variation in brightness of a star between its centre and edge (or limb) when viewed in the plane of the sky. Stellar brightness is maximal at the centre and then decreases radially and monotonically towards the limb -- hence the term "limb darkening". This effect is crucial for finding and characterising planets beyond our Solar System, known as exoplanets, as these planets are often studied when crossing in front of their host stars. As such, limb darkening is directly linked to the exoplanet signals. Limb darkening is typically modelled by one of various functional forms, as outlined in Claret (2000) and Sing (2010), and the coefficients of these functions is what ExoTiC-LD is designed to compute. A wide variety of functional forms are supported, including those benchmarked by Espinoza &amp; Jord\'an (2016) as well as reparameterisations suggested by Kipping (2013).</description>

      <title>Viewing the explosion models of type Ia supernovae via the insight from terrestrial cellular detonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cellular structure is considered to be a key as a criterion in initiation, propagation, and quenching of terrestrial detonation. While a few studies on type Ia supernovae, which are known to involve detonation, have addressed the importance of the cellular structure, further detailed treatment will benefit enhanced understanding of the explosion outcomes. In the present study, we bridge this gap in the astrophysics and engineering fields, focusing on the detonation in a heliumrich white dwarf envelope as the triggering process for the so-called double-detonation model. The cellular structures are quantified via high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. We demonstrate that widely-accepted terrestrial-experimental criteria for quenching and initiation of detonation can indeed explain the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations very well. The present study highlights the potential of continuing to apply the insight from terrestrial detonation experiments to astrophysical problems, specifically the long unresolved problem of the explosion mechanism of type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., radial gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span $50\%$ to $70\%$ of each planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, quickly leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations of convective staircases in non-rotating and rotating flows, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. Thus, the current existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>

      <title>Discovery space and science with the PLACID stellar coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world's first ever ''adaptive stellar coronagraph'' facility will be the PLACID instrument, installed on Turkey's new national observatory 4-m DAG telescope. PLACID incorporates a customized spatial light modulator (SLM) acting as a dynamically addressed focal-plane phase mask (FPM) coronagraph in the H-Ks bands. This new approach to high-contrast imaging will be applied on-sky in late 2024/early 2025. We present a first estimate of the science discovery space for PLACID, in terms of known exoplanets and brown dwarfs, considering raw lab contrast, contrast ratios, limiting magnitudes, coronagraphic inner working angle etc. In the future, we will also look into predicted disk and binary or multiple stars systems imaging performance, with the latter being a possible niche science case for the instrument (adaptive FPM for multiple stars). This work will inform on the first light PLACID commissioning activities and early science on the DAG telescope and is deemed to evolve in function of future developments on the DAG AO instrumentation suite.</description>

      <title>Structure in the speed of sound: from neutron stars to heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the observation of both heavy neutron stars and light ones with small radii, one anticipates a steep rise in the speed of sound of nuclear matter as a function of baryon density up to values close to the causal limit. A question follows whether such behavior of the speed of sound in neutron-rich matter is compatible with the equation of state extracted from low-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we consider a family of neutron star equations of state characterized by a steep rise in the speed of sound, and use the symmetry energy expansion to obtain equations of state applicable to the almost-symmetric nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. We then compare collective flow data from low-energy heavy-ion experiments with results of simulations obtained using the hadronic transport code SMASH with the mean-field potential reproducing the density-dependence of the speed of sound. We show that equations of state featuring a peak in the speed of sound squared occurring at densities between 2-3 times the saturation density of normal nuclear matter, producing neutron stars of nearly M_max~2.5 M_Sun, are consistent with heavy-ion collision data.</description>

      <title>Delayed emission from luminous blue optical transients in black-hole binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At least three members of the recently identified class of fast luminous blue optical transient show evidence of late-time electromagnetic activity in great excess of what predicted by an extrapolation of the early time emission. In particular, AT2022tsd displays fast, bright optical fluctuations approximately a month after the initial detection. Here, we propose that these transients are produced by exploding stars in black hole binary systems, and that the late-time activity is due to the accretion of clumpy ejecta onto the companion black hole. We derive the energetics and timescales involved, compute the emission spectrum, and discuss whether the ensuing emission is diffused or not in the remnant. We find that this model can explain the observed range of behaviors for reasonable ranges of the orbital separation and the ejecta velocity and clumpiness. Close separation and clumpy, high velocity ejecta result in bright variable emission, as seen in AT2022tsd. A wider separation and smaller ejecta velocity, conversely, give rise to fairly constant emission at a lower luminosity. We suggest that high-cadence, simultaneous, panchromatic monitoring of future transients should be carried out to better understand the origin of the late emission and the role of binarity in the diversity of explosive stellar transients.</description>

      <title>Pair-instability evolution and explosions in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very massive stars are radiation pressure dominated. Before running out of viable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where electron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering their collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long been predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational pair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black hole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all stellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova), which leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among modelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very high-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational confirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution on black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the present and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high redshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the current understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis on the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed electromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and indirect searches.</description>
