      <title>On the Boolean Network Theory of Datalog$^\neg$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Datalog$^\neg$ is a central formalism used in a variety of domains ranging from deductive databases and abstract argumentation frameworks to answer set programming. Its model theory is the finite counterpart of the logical semantics developed for normal logic programs, mainly based on the notions of Clark's completion and two-valued or three-valued canonical models including supported, stable, regular and well-founded models. In this paper we establish a formal link between Datalog$^\neg$ and Boolean network theory, which was initially introduced by Stuart Kaufman and Ren\'e Thomas to reason about gene regulatory networks. We use previous results from Boolean network theory to prove that in the absence of odd cycles in a Datalog$^\neg$ program, the regular models coincide with the stable models, which entails the existence of stable models, and in the absence of even cycles, we show the uniqueness of stable partial models, which entails the uniqueness of regular models. These results on regular models have been claimed by You and Yuan in 1994 for normal logic programs but we show problems in their definition of well-founded stratification and in their proofs that we can fix for negative normal logic programs only. We also give upper bounds on the numbers of stable partial, regular, and stable models of a Datalog$^\neg$ program using the cardinality of a feedback vertex set in its atom dependency graph. Interestingly, our connection to Boolean network theory also points us to the notion of trap spaces for Datalog$^\neg$ programs. We relate the notions of supported or stable trap spaces to the other semantics of Datalog$^\neg$, and show the equivalence between subset-minimal stable trap spaces and regular models.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Related Methods for Solving Set Constraint Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new methods for solving Set Constraint Problems. While current methods focus on classical techniques, we offer both a quantum-inspired matrix method and a quantum matrix method that neutralizes common contradictions and inconsistencies that appear in these types of problems. We start by formally defining a Set Constraint Problem. We then explain current, classical methods that are used to solve these problems and the drawbacks of such methods. After this, we explain a new quantum-inspired matrix method that allows us to solve these problems, with classical limitations. Finally, we explain a new quantum matrix method that solves these problems using quantum information science.</description>

      <title>SMT and Functional Equation Solving over the Reals: Challenges from the IMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use SMT technology to address a class of problems involving uninterpreted functions and nonlinear real arithmetic. In particular, we focus on problems commonly found in mathematical competitions, such as the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), where the task is to determine all solutions to constraints on an uninterpreted function. Although these problems require only high-school-level mathematics, state-of-the-art SMT solvers often struggle with them. We propose several techniques to improve SMT performance in this setting.</description>

      <title>Sound and Complete Invariant-Based Heap Encodings (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15844v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verification of programs operating on mutable, heap-allocated data structures poses significant challenges due to potentially unbounded structures like linked lists and trees. In this paper, we present a novel relational heap encoding leveraging uninterpreted predicates and prophecy variables, reducing heap verification tasks to satisfiability checks over integers in constrained Horn clauses (CHCs). To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first invariant-based method that achieves both soundness and completeness for heap-manipulating programs. We provide formal proofs establishing the correctness of our encodings. Through an experimental evaluation we demonstrate that our method significantly extends the capability of existing CHC-based verification tools, allowing automatic verification of programs with heap previously unreachable by state-of-the-art tools.</description>

      <title>The Value Problem for Multiple-Environment MDPs with Parity Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multiple-environment Markov decision processes (MEMDP), which consist of a finite set of MDPs over the same state space, representing different scenarios of transition structure and probability. The value of a strategy is the probability to satisfy the objective, here a parity objective, in the worst-case scenario, and the value of an MEMDP is the supremum of the values achievable by a strategy.
  We show that deciding whether the value is 1 is a PSPACE-complete problem, and even in P when the number of environments is fixed, along with new insights to the almost-sure winning problem, which is to decide if there exists a strategy with value 1. Pure strategies are sufficient for theses problems, whereas randomization is necessary in general when the value is smaller than 1. We present an algorithm to approximate the value, running in double exponential space. Our results are in contrast to the related model of partially-observable MDPs where all these problems are known to be undecidable.</description>

      <title>Approximate matrices of systems of max-min fuzzy relational equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we address the inconsistency of a system of max-min fuzzy relational equations by minimally modifying the matrix governing the system in order to achieve consistency. Our method yields consistent systems that approximate the original inconsistent system in the following sense: the right-hand side vector of each consistent system is that of the inconsistent system, and the coefficients of the matrix governing each consistent system are obtained by modifying, exactly and minimally, the entries of the original matrix that must be corrected to achieve consistency, while leaving all other entries unchanged.
  To obtain a consistent system that closely approximates the considered inconsistent system, we study the distance (in terms of a norm among $L_1$, $L_2$ or $L_\infty$) between the matrix of the inconsistent system and the set formed by the matrices of consistent systems that use the same right-hand side vector as the inconsistent system. We show that our method allows us to directly compute matrices of consistent systems that use the same right-hand side vector as the inconsistent system whose distance in terms of $L_\infty$ norm to the matrix of the inconsistent system is minimal (the computational costs are higher when using $L_1$ norm or $L_2$ norm). We also give an explicit analytical formula for computing this minimal $L_\infty$ distance. Finally, we translate our results for systems of min-max fuzzy relational equations and present some potential applications.</description>

      <title>Decisiveness for countable MDPs and insights for NPLCSs and POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.10426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov chains and Markov decision processes (MDPs) are well-established probabilistic models. While finite Markov models are well-understood, analysing their infinite counterparts remains a significant challenge. Decisiveness has proven to be an elegant property for countable Markov chains: it is general enough to be satisfied by several natural classes of countable Markov chains, and it is a sufficient condition for simple qualitative and approximate quantitative model-checking algorithms to exist.
  In contrast, existing works on the formal analysis of countable MDPs usually rely on ad hoc techniques tailored to specific classes. We provide here a general framework to analyse countable MDPs by extending the notion of decisiveness. Compared to Markov chains, MDPs exhibit extra non-determinism that can be resolved in an adversarial or cooperative way, leading to multiple natural notions of decisiveness. We show that these notions enable the approximation of reachability and safety probabilities in countable MDPs using simple model-checking procedures.
  We then instantiate our generic approach to two concrete classes of models inducing countable MDPs: non-deterministic probabilistic lossy channel systems and partially observable MDPs. This leads to an algorithm to approximately compute safety probabilities in each of these classes.</description>

      <title>Semantical Analysis of Intuitionistic Modal Logics between CK and IK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intuitionistic modal logics considered between Constructive K (CK) and Intuitionistic K (IK) differ in their treatment of the possibility (diamond) connective. It was recently rediscovered that some logics between CK and IK also disagree on their diamond-free fragments, with only some remaining conservative over the standard axiomatisation of intuitionistic modal logic with necessity (box) alone. We show that relational Kripke semantics for CK can be extended with frame conditions for all axioms in the standard axiomatisation of IK, as well as other axioms previously studied. This allows us to answer open questions about the (non-)conservativity of such logics over intuitionistic modal logic without diamond. Our results are formalised using the Coq Proof Assistant.</description>

      <title>Weihrauch problems as containers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We note that Weihrauch problems can be regarded as containers over the category of projective represented spaces and that Weihrauch reductions correspond exactly to container morphisms. We also show that Bauer's extended Weihrauch degrees and the posetal reflection of containers over partition assemblies are equivalent. Using this characterization, we show how a number of operators over Weihrauch degrees, such as the composition product, also arise naturally from the abstract theory of polynomial functors.</description>

      <title>Convergence Laws for Extensions of First-Order Logic with Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many standard models of random structure, first-order logic sentences exhibit a convergence phenomenon on random inputs. The most well-known example is for random graphs with constant edge probability, where the probabilities of first-order sentences converge to 0 or 1. In other cases, such as certain ``sparse random graph'' models, the probabilities of sentences converge, although not necessarily to 0 or 1. In this work we deal with extensions of first-order logic with aggregate operators, variations of averaging. These logics will consist of real-valued terms, and we allow arbitrary Lipschitz functions to be used as ``connectives''. We show that some of the well-known convergence laws extend to this setting.</description>

      <title>LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07647v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.</description>
