      <title>Resonant Conversion of Gravitational Waves in Neutron Star Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves are the subject of rapidly growing interest in the theoretical and experimental community. In this work we calculate the resonant conversion of gravitational waves into photons in the magnetospheres of neutron stars via the inverse Gertsenshtein mechanism. The resonance occurs in regions where the vacuum birefringence effects cancel the classical plasma contribution to the photon dispersion relation, leading to a massless photon in the medium which becomes kinematically matched to the graviton. We set limits on the amplitude of a possible stochastic background of gravitational waves using X-ray and IR flux measurements of neutron stars. Using Chandra ($2-8\,\text{keV}$) and NuSTAR ($3-79\,\text{keV}$) observations of RX J1856.6-3754, we set strain limits $h_c^{\rm lim} \simeq 10^{-26} - 10^{-24}$ in the frequency range $ 5\times 10^{17}\, {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 2\times 10^{19}\,\text{Hz}$. Our limits are many orders of magnitude stronger than existing constrains from individual neutron stars at the same frequencies. We also use recent JWST observations of the Magnetar 4U 0142+61 in the range $2.7\times 10^{13}\, {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 5.9\times 10^{13}\, {\rm Hz} $, setting a limit $h_{\rm c}^{\rm lim} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-19}$. These constraints are in complementary frequency ranges to laboratory searches with CAST, OSQAR and ALPS II. We expect these limits to be improved both in reach and breadth with a more exhaustive use of telescope data across the full spectrum of frequencies and targets.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Dark Glueball Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New gauge forces can play an important role in the evolution of the early universe. In this work we investigate the cosmological implications of a pure Yang-Mills dark sector that is dominantly populated after primordial inflation. Such a dark sector takes the form of a bath of dark gluons at high temperatures, but confines at lower temperatures to produce a spectrum of dark glueballs. These glueballs then undergo a freezeout process such that the remnant population is nearly completely dominated by the lightest state. To reproduce the observed cosmology, this lightest glueball species must decay to the Standard Model to repopulate and reheat it. At leading order, this can occur through a connector operator of dimension-6. In contrast, other glueballs can be parametrically long-lived or stable, and remain as contributors to dark matter or modify the observed cosmology through their later decays. In this work we study the evolution of such dark sectors in detail. We demonstrate that stable remnant glueballs can produce the measured dark matter abundance. We also derive broad constraints on non-Abelian dark sectors from overproduction of remnant glueballs when they are stable or from their destructive impact when they are able to decay.</description>

      <title>Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars: Bremsstrahlung and modified urca rates reexamined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars is dominated by the modified urca (murca) process and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. The standard emission rates were provided by Friman and Maxwell in 1979, effectively based on a chiral Lagrangian framework with pion and rho meson exchange, supplemented by Landau parameters to describe short-range interactions. We reevaluate these rates within the same framework, correcting several errors and removing unnecessary simplifications, notably the triangular approximation -- Fermi momenta of protons and leptons negligible compared to the neutrons one -- in MURCA, and quantify their importance. The impact of rho meson exchange, previously argued to cancel with interference effects, is actually quite relevant. Altogether, the cooling rates are reduced by as much as a factor 2. We provide comprehensive analytical formulas encompassing all contributions, designed for straightforward numerical implementation. Our results are particularly relevant for astrophysical studies of neutron stars evolution and for studies of physics beyond the standard model, where the emission of new particles -- such as axions -- is typically computed within the same framework we adopt here.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses and mixing from milli-charged dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple extension to the Standard Model, wherein neutrinos naturally attain small Majorana masses through a one-loop radiative mechanism featuring particles within the loops characterized by milli-charges. Unlike the conventional scotogenic model, our approach avoids imposing a discrete symmetry or expanding the gauge sector. The minuscule electric charges ensure the stability of the lightest particle within the loop as a viable dark matter candidate. Our investigation systematically scrutinizes the far-reaching phenomenological implications arising from these minuscule charges.</description>

      <title>$\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet: Emulation of cosmic-ray antideuteron fluxes from dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray antimatter, particularly low-energy antideuterons, serves as a sensitive probe of dark matter annihilating in our Galaxy. We study this smoking-gun signature and explore its complementarity with indirect dark matter searches using cosmic-ray antiprotons. To this end, we develop the neural network emulator $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet, enabling a fast prediction of propagated antideuteron energy spectra for a wide range of annihilation channels and their combinations. We revisit the Monte Carlo simulation of antideuteron coalescence and cosmic-ray propagation, allowing us to explore the uncertainties of both processes. In particular, we take into account uncertainties from the $\Lambda_b$ production rate and consider two distinctly different propagation models. Requiring consistency with cosmic-ray antiproton limits, we find that AMS-02 shows sensitivity to a few windows of dark matter masses only, most prominently below 20 GeV. This region can be probed independently by the upcoming GAPS experiment. The program package $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Majorana phases beyond neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\nu_M{\rm SM}$ is defined as the SM extended to include dimension-5 operators. In this model neutrino masses violate lepton number, and two parameters of the lepton mixing matrix, the Majorana phases, are yet to be constrained. One combination of these phases and the neutrino masses, often denoted by $m_{ee}$, is probed by neutrinoless double beta decays ($0\nu\beta\beta$). We explore what information may be obtained beyond $0\nu\beta\beta$, and how it depends on the lightest neutrino mass. We point out that with current central values of the mixing parameters, $\Delta L_e=2$ and $\Delta L_e=\Delta L_\mu = 1$ (or $\Delta L_e=2$ and $\Delta L_\mu = 2$) processes cannot simultaneously vanish, providing a no-lose theorem, in principle, for excluding the $\nu_M{\rm SM}$, even in the case of normal mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Solving the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with a quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation (hBSE), describing a bound system in a genuinely relativistic quantum-field theory framework, was solved for the first time by using a D-Wave quantum annealer. After applying standard techniques of discretization, the hBSE, in ladder approximation, can be formally transformed in a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), with two square matrices: one symmetric and the other non symmetric. The latter matrix poses the challenge of obtaining a suitable formal approach for investigating the non symmetric GEVP by means of a quantum annealer, i.e to recast it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. A broad numerical analysis of the proposed algorithms, applied to matrices of dimension up to 64, was carried out by using both the proprietary simulated-anneaing package and the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 system. The numerical results very nicely compare with those obtained with standard classical algorithms, and also show interesting scalability features.</description>

      <title>Two-gluon one-photon vertex in a magnetic field and its explicit one-loop approximation in the intermediate field strength regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the general structure for the two-gluon one-photon vertex in the presence of a constant magnetic field. We show that, when accounting for the symmetries satisfied by the strong and electromagnetic interactions under parity, charge conjugation and gluon interchange, and for gluons and photons on mass-shell, there exist only three possible tensor structures that span the vertex. These correspond to external products of the polarization vectors for each of the particles in the vertex. We also explicitly compute the one-loop approximation to this vertex in the intermediate field strength regime, which is the most appropriate one to describe possible effects of the presence of a magnetic field to enhance photon emission during pre-equilibrium in peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that the most favored direction for the photon to propagate is in the plane transverse to the field, which is consistent with a positive contribution to $\nu_2$ and may help to understand the larger than expected elliptic flow coefficient measured in this kind of reactions.</description>

      <title>Scattering Neutrinos, Spin Models, and Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of Heisenberg all-to-all coupled spin models inspired by neutrino interactions in a supernova with $N$ degrees of freedom. These models are characterized by a coupling matrix that is relatively simple in the sense that there are only a few, relative to $N$, non-trivial eigenvalues, in distinction to the classic Heisenberg spin-glass models, leading to distinct behavior in both the high-temperature and low-temperature regimes. When the momenta of the neutrinos are uniform and random in directions, we can calculate the large-$N$ partition function for the quantum Heisenberg model. In particular, the high-temperature partition function predicts a non-Gaussian density of states, providing interesting counter-examples showing the limits of general theorems on the density of states for quantum spin models. We can repeat the same argument for classical Heisenberg models, also known as rotor models, and we find the high-temperature expansion is completely controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix, and again predicts non-Gaussian behavior for the density of states as long as the number of eigenvalues does not scale linearly with $N$. Indeed, we derive the amusing fact that these \emph{thermodynamic} partition functions are essentially the generating function for counting permutations in the high-temperature regime. Finally, for the case relevant to neutrinos in a supernova, we identify the low-temperature phase as a unique state with the direction of the momenta of the neutrino dictating its coherent state in flavor-space, a state we dub the "flavor-momentum-locked" state.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the CP-odd Higgs in a Generalized 2HDM Model at a Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the generalized 2HDM in view of a muon collider proposed by the International Muon Collider Collaboration (IMCC). The model offers a large region of parameter space where the observed muon ($g-2$) excess can be accommodated. Interestingly this parameter space can be probed in a muon collider with greater advantage than Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In a parameter space where muon anomaly, lepton flavor violation, electroweak precision data, B-physics and collider constraints are satisfied, we propose and explore a unique channel $\ell^+\ell^{'-}\gamma+$missing energy to be searched at the 3 TeV muon collider as an indirect probe of the low mass pseudoscalar of the model.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusion of heavy quark in hot QCD matter by the fractional Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subdiffusion phenomena are studied for heavy quarks dynamics in the hot QCD matter. Our approach aims to provide a more realistic description of heavy quark dynamics through detailed theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, utilizing the fractional Langevin equation framework with the Caputo fractional derivative. We present numerical schemes for the fractional Langevin equation for subdiffusion and calculate the time evolution mean squared displacement and mean squared momentum of the heavy quarks. Our results indicate that the mean squared displacements of the heavy quarks for the subdiffusion process deviate from a linear relationship with time. Further, we calculate the normalized momentum correlation function, kinetic energy, and momentum spread. Finally, we show the effect of subdiffusion on experimental observables, the nuclear modification factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure, it is believed that quarks and gluons (particles that mediate the interaction between quarks) can be "free" in a given volume. This hypothetical phase of matter is called plasma of quarks and gluons, QGP for its acronym in English. It is speculated that it existed in the first moments after the \textit{Big Bang} and that it exists inside N\^eutron stars due to the enormous energy density in these places. These conditions of very high temperature and energy density can be reproduced in the laboratory with the collision of heavy ions in an ultra-relativistic regime in accelerators such as the RHIC and the LHC. However, due to the extremely short duration of the QGP phase after the collision, we were unable to directly observe the plasma, only the so-called \textit{final observables}, such as the particles generated by this set of quarks, gluons and energy and the distribution of momentum of these particles. Therefore, mathematical modeling is an essential tool in understanding the behavior of the system, for example, to have an idea of the value of viscosities in this phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically calculate transition magnetic moments, radiative decay widths, and axial-vector coupling constants of octet hidden-charm molecular pentaquark states with different flavor representations in constituent quark model. We discuss the relations between transition magnetic moments and decay widths for pentaquark states. For octet pentaquark states with the $8_{1f}$ and $8_{2f}$ flavor representations, decay widths of the processes $P_{\psi}|\frac{3}{2}^-\rangle_{(\frac{1}{2}^+\otimes1^-)}\to P_{\psi}|\frac{1}{2}^-\rangle_{(\frac{1}{2}^+\otimes0^-)}\gamma$ and $P_{\psi}|\frac{1}{2}^-\rangle_{(\frac{1}{2}^+\otimes1^-)}\to P_{\psi}|\frac{1}{2}^-\rangle_{(\frac{1}{2}^+\otimes0^-)}\gamma$ are quite close, decay widths of the $P_{\psi}|\frac{3}{2}^-\rangle_{(\frac{1}{2}^+\otimes1^-)}\to P_{\psi}|\frac{1}{2}^-\rangle_{(\frac{1}{2}^+\otimes1^-)}\gamma$ process are close to zero, and we notice that the axial-vector coupling constants of the pentaquark states are generally smaller than that of the nucleon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of a dynamical gluon in the pion within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework and compare it with the solution of the Minkowski space Bethe-Salpeter equation, focusing on contributions beyond the valence state. Particularly in BLFQ, we identify the effect on the pion structure of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking by the enhancement of the spin-flip matrix element, through the $|q\bar qg\rangle$ component of the light-front wave function and associated gluon parton distribution function (PDF). We explicitly show an enhancement of the low-$x$ contribution in the quark PDF associated with the large spin-flip matrix element, necessary to provide the $\pi-\rho$ mass splitting.</description>

      <title>Indirect Detection for Higgs Portal Majorana Fermionic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\gamma$-ray signal emitted from dark matter (DM) pair annihilation in the Higgs portal Majorana fermion DM model. In the model, a Majorana fermion DM $\chi$ couples with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field $H$ through a higher-dimensional term $-{\cal L}\supset H^\dagger H \bar{\chi}\chi/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is a cutoff scale. The pair annihilation of $\chi$ through the above term produces the Higgs boson and the longitudinal modes of $W,Z$ gauge bosons. The Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) are used as the most promising targets to search for the $\gamma$-ray signal of the model, due to high DM density and lack of astrophysical backgrounds. The {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope ({\it Fermi}-LAT) is used for the search, for its high sensitivity. In this work, we use 14-year {\it Fermi}-LAT data from 16 dSphs, to constrain the DM pair annihilation cross section for the DM mass range from 125 GeV to 100 TeV.</description>

      <title>Investigating a new neutral heavy gauge boson within the mono-Z$^{\prime}$ model via simulated pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to explore the potential for generating events related to dark matter (DM) in conjunction with a neutral heavy gauge boson (Z$^{\prime}$) decaying leptonically during proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These collisions occur at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, with a high integrated luminosity equivalent to 1000 fb$^{-1}$. Our analysis involves interpreting the outcomes through Monte Carlo simulation of the effective field theory (EFT) framework. If no new physics is detected, we establish constraints on various parameters within the EFT context, such as the scenario cutoff scale ($\Lambda$) and the Z$^{\prime}$ mass.</description>

      <title>Refinable modeling for unbinned SMEFT analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present techniques for estimating the effects of systematic uncertainties in unbinned data analyses at the LHC. Our primary focus is constraining the Wilson coefficients in the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT), but the methodology applies to broader parametric models of phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). We elevate the well-established procedures for binned Poisson counting experiments to the unbinned case by utilizing machine-learned surrogates of the likelihood ratio. This approach can be applied to various theoretical, modeling, and experimental uncertainties. By establishing a common statistical framework for BSM and systematic effects, we lay the groundwork for future unbinned analyses at the LHC. Additionally, we introduce a novel tree-boosting algorithm capable of learning highly accurate parameterizations of systematic effects. This algorithm extends the existing toolkit with a versatile and robust alternative. We demonstrate our approach using the example of an SMEFT interpretation of highly energetic top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Axion Detection Experiments Meet the Majoron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majoron is a well-motivated light (pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone) boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global lepton-number symmetry. In this {\it letter}, we relate the spontaneous breaking scale and its soft-breaking mass by requiring that the majoron is the main component of the dark matter. An electromagnetic-anomalous coupling can be induced by minimally modifying the original majoron model, surprisingly, predicting a parameter region that largely overlaps with the QCD-axion dark matter band. Thus, we expect that axion search experiments meet the majoron.</description>

      <title>Laboratory constraint on the electric charge of the neutron and the neutrino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit constraints on the electric charge of the neutron and neutrino as well as on e_p+e_e. We consider phenomenological constraints based on laboratory study of the electrical neutrality of subatomic, atomic, and molecular species under assumption of the conservation of the electric charge in the beta decay, that relates e_p+e_e, e_n, and e_nu. Some previously published constraints utilized an additional assumption e_nu=0, which we do not. We dismiss a cosmological constraint at the level of 10^-35 e utilized by PDG in their Review of particle properties as a controversial one which makes the laboratory constraints on e_nu dominant.
  The phenomenological constraints from the laboratory experiments are obtained as e_p+e_e=(0.2\pm2.6)10^-21 e, e_n=(-0.4\pm1.1)10^-21 e, and e_nu=(0.6\pm3.2)10^{-21} e. The ones on e_p+e_e and e_n are at the same level as the PDG constraints, while our e_nu constraint is several orders of magnitude weaker than the controversial cosmological result dominated in the PDG constraint, but several orders of magnitude stronger than the other individual e_nu constraints considered by PDG.
  We also consider consistency of the phenomenological constraints and the SM. The SM ignores the neutrino mass term and cannot describe the neutrino oscillations which makes it not a complete theory but a part of it. We demonstrate that the condition of the cancellation of the triangle anomaly within the complete theory does not disagree with the phenomenological constraints since different extensions of the SM may produce different additional contributions to the anomaly. In particular, we consider a minimal extension of the SM, where leptons (nu,e) are treated the same ways as quarks, which sets e_p+e_e=0 and allows for numerical strengthening the constraint on e_n and e_nu, which is e_n=-e_nu=(-0.4\pm1.0)10^-21 e.</description>

      <title>Loop-induced masses for the first two generations with optimum flavour violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism for the masses of third, second, and first generation charged fermions at the tree, 1-loop, and 2-loop levels, respectively, is proposed. The fermionic self-energy corrections that lead to this arrangement are induced through heavy vector bosons of a new gauged flavour symmetry group $G_F$. It is shown that a single Abelian group suffices as $G_F$. Moreover, the gauge charges are optimized to result in relatively smaller flavour violations in processes involving the first and second generation fermions. The scheme is explicitly implemented on the Standard Model fermions in an anomaly-free manner and is shown to be viable with observed charged fermion masses and quark mixings. Constraints from flavour violations dictate the lower limit on the new physics scale in these types of frameworks. Through optimal flavour violation, it is shown that nearly two orders of magnitude improvement can be achieved on the lower limit, leading to the new physics scale $\ge 10^3$ TeV in this case. Further improvements are possible at the cost of the down quark mass deviating more than $3 \sigma$ from its value extracted from lattice calculations. Options for inducing tiny masses for light neutrinos are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII) Collaboration reconstructed the invariant mass of three pairs of positive and negative pions by studying the decay process of charmonium to a photon and three pairs of positive and negative pions. They discovered the resonant structures X(1840) and X(1880), which are interpreted as the predicted proton-antiproton bound states, also known as protonium. This article briefly introduces the experimental discovery processes of these resonant structures and discusses the theoretical explorations inspired by them. The predictions proposed by these theoretical explorations offer a new perspective for studying the nature of these particles and new decay modes. Therefore the collaborative exploration of experiments and theory plays a positive role in deepening understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <title>Study of the $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ dibaryons in constituent quark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dibaryons are the simplest system in which the baryon-baryon interaction, and hence the underlying quark-quark interaction, can be studied in a clear way. Although the only dibaryon known today is the deuteron (and possibly the $d^*$), fully heavy dibaryons are good candidates for bound states because in such systems the kinetic energy is small and the high symmetry of the wave function favours binding. In this study, the possible existence of $\Omega_{ccc}\Omega_{ccc}$ and $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ dibaryons is investigated in the framework of a constituent quark model that satisfactorily describes the deuteron, the $d^*(2380)$ and the $NN$ interaction. $J^P=0^+$ candidates are found in both systems with binding energies of the order of MeV.</description>

      <title>Probing self-interacting ultra-high-energy neutrinos with cosmic 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the constraints on secret self-interactions of neutrinos by examining the impact of radiative scattering of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. These neutrinos are produced from the decay of superheavy dark matter and interact with the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). We explore how these interactions influence the 21-cm hydrogen signal during the cosmic dark ages and cosmic dawn, periods relatively free from astrophysical uncertainties, providing a clearer signal for studying non-standard neutrino interactions. By analyzing the global brightness temperature measurements, we constrain the scattering cross-section of UHE self-interacting neutrinos, determining the coupling constant $g$ to be within $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}$ for neutrino energies in the PeV to EeV range. Interestingly, these constraints are more competitive than those from existing astrophysical and collider experiments. As future 21-cm experiments focus on measuring brightness temperature across a wide range of redshifts from the cosmic dark ages to reionization, using the epoch of 21-cm to probe neutrino properties could provide crucial insights into dark matter and neutrino physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the higher-twist generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the pion and kaon at zero skewness by adopting the overlap representation within the light-cone formalism. Using the wave functions of pion and kaon deduced from a light-cone quark model (LCQM), we calculate the twist-3 and twist-4 GPDs $E_{2}(x,0,t)$, $G_{2}(x,0,t)$, $F_{3}(x,0,t)$ and $H_{3}(x,0,t)$ of valence quark inside the pion and kaon mesons. Numerical results for these higher-twist GPDs are presented. By taking the forward limit, we also present the numerical results for the corresponding twist-3 and twist-4 parton distribution functions (PDFs) $e(x)$ and $f_{3}(x)$ of pion and kaon. We further study the relations between $e(x)$ or $f_{3}(x)$ and the twist-2 unpolarized PDF $f_{1}(x)$.</description>

      <title>Hint to Supersymmetry from GR Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $S$-matrix formulation of gravity suggests that the $\theta$-vacuum structure must not be sustained by the theory. We point out that, when applied to the vacuum of general relativity, this criterion hints to supersymmetry. The topological susceptibility of gravitational vacuum induced by Eguchi-Hanson instantons can be eliminated neither by spin-$1/2$ fermions nor by an axion coupled via them since such fermions do not provide instanton zero modes. Instead, the job is done by a spin-$3/2$ fermion, hence realizing a local supersymmetry. This scenario also necessitates the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry and predicts the existence of axion of $R$-symmetry which gets mass exclusively from the gravitational instantons. The $R$-axion can be a viable dark matter candidate. Matching between the index and the anomaly imposes a constraint that spin-$1/2$ fermions should not contribute to the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Physical-mass calculation of $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$ resonance parameters via $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our study of the $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$ resonances from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) employing domain-wall fermions at physical quark masses. We determine the finite-volume energy spectrum in various momentum frames and obtain phase-shift parameterizations via the L\"uscher formalism, and as a final step the complex resonance poles of the $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ elastic scattering amplitudes via an analytical continuation of the models. By sampling a large number of representative sets of underlying energy-level fits, we also assign a systematic uncertainty to our final results. This is a significant extension to data-driven analysis methods that have been used in lattice QCD to date, due to the two-step nature of the formalism. Our final pole positions, $M+i\Gamma/2$, with all statistical and systematic errors exposed, are $M_{K^{*}} = 893(2)(8)(54)(2)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{K^{*}} = 51(2)(11)(3)(0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the $K^*(892)$ resonance and $M_{\rho} = 796(5)(15)(48)(2)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{\rho} = 192(10)(28)(12)(0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the $\rho(770)$ resonance. The four differently grouped sources of uncertainties are, in the order of occurrence: statistical, data-driven systematic, an estimation of systematic effects beyond our computation (dominated by the fact that we employ a single lattice spacing), and the error from the scale-setting uncertainty on our ensemble.</description>

      <title>Light and strange vector resonances from lattice QCD at physical quark masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first ab initio calculation at physical quark masses of scattering amplitudes describing the lightest pseudoscalar mesons interacting via the strong force in the vector channel. Using lattice quantum chromodynamics, we postdict the defining parameters for two short-lived resonances, the $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$, which manifest as complex energy poles in $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ scattering amplitudes, respectively. The calculation proceeds by first computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the two-hadron systems, and then determining the amplitudes from the energies using the L\"uscher formalism. The error budget includes a data-driven systematic error, obtained by scanning possible fit ranges and fit models to extract the spectrum from Euclidean correlators, as well as the scattering amplitudes from the latter. The final results, obtained by analytically continuing multiple parameterizations into the complex energy plane, are $M_\rho = 796(5)(50)~\mathrm{MeV}$, $\Gamma_\rho = 192(10)(31)~\mathrm{MeV}$, $M_{K^*} = 893(2)(54)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{K^*} = 51(2)(11)~\mathrm{MeV}$, where the subscript indicates the resonance and $M$ and $\Gamma$ stand for the mass and width, respectively, and where the first bracket indicates the statistical and the second bracket the systematic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Interacting ultralight dark matter and dark energy and fits to cosmological data in a field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of dark matter as a pressure-less fluid and of dark energy as a cosmological constant, both minimally coupled to gravity, constitutes the basis of the concordance $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. However, the concordance model is based on using equations of motion directly for the fluids with constraints placed on their sources, and lacks an underlying Lagrangian. In this work, we propose a Lagrangian model of two spin zero fields describing dark energy and dark matter with an interaction term between the two along with self-interactions. We study the background evolution of the fields as well as their linear perturbations, suggesting an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM with dark matter and dark energy being fundamental dynamical fields. The parameters of the model are extracted using a Bayesian inference tool based on multiple cosmological data sets which include those of Planck (with lensing), BAO, Pantheon, SH0ES, and WiggleZ. Using these data, we set constraints on the dark matter mass and the interaction strengths. Furthermore, we find that the model is able to alleviate the Hubble tension for some data sets while also resolving the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>The AMS-02 cosmic ray deuteron flux is consistent with a secondary origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent measurements of cosmic ray deuteron fluxes by AMS-02 show that the rigidity dependence of deuterons is similar with that of protons but flatter than $^3$He, which has been attributed to the existence of primary deuterons with abundance much higher than that from the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The requirement of highly deuteron-abundant sources imposes a serious challenge on the modern astrophysics since there is no known process to produce a large amount of deuterons without violating other constraints \cite{1976Natur.263..198E}. In this work we demonstrate that the fragmentation of heavy nuclei up to iron plays a crucial role in shaping/enhancing the spectrum/flux of the cosmic ray deuterons. Based on the latest cosmic ray data, the predicted secondary fluxes of deuterons and $^3$He are found to be reasonably consistent with the AMS-02 measurements and a primary deuteron component is not needed. The apparent difference between D/$^4$He (D/p) and $^3$He/$^4$He ($^3$He/p) is probably due to a combined effect of the kinetic-energy-to-rigidity conversion and the solar modulation. More precise measurements of the fragmentation cross sections of various nuclei to produce deuterons, tritons, and $^3$He in a wide energy range will be very helpful in further testing the secondary origin of cosmic ray deuterons.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the structure of a cosmic string wake, considering both the effects of regular and quantum pressure terms. We consider the total fluid to consist of a combination of baryons and dark matter. Hence, we are also able to study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the distribution of baryons inside the wake. We focus on parameter values for the superfluid dark matter which allow a MONDian explanation of galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Automated Choice for the Best Renormalization Scheme in BSM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explorations of models beyond the Standard Model (BSM) naturally involve scans over the unknown BSM parameters. On the other hand, high precision predictions require calculations at the loop-level and thus a renormalization of (some of) the BSM parameters. Often many choices are possible for the renormalization scheme (RS). This concerns the choice of the set of to-be-renormalized parameters out of a larger set of BSM parameters, but can also concern the type of renormalization condition which is chosen for a specific parameter. A given RS can be well suited to yield "stable" and "well behaved" higher-order corrections in one part of the BSM parameter space, but can fail completely in other parts, which may not even be noticed numerically if an isolated parameter point is investigated, or when the higher-order BSM calculations are performed in an automated, not supervised set-up. Consequently, the (automated) exploration of BSM models requires a choice of a good RS {\em before} the calculation is performed. We propose a new method how such a choice can be performed. We demonstrate the feasibility of our new method in the chargino/neutralino sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), but stress the general applicability of our method to all types of BSM models.</description>

Abstract: The bound on the proton lifetime is one of a small handful of observations that constrains physics not far from the Planck scale. This calls for a calculation of the proton lifetime in quantum gravity. Here, we calculate how quantum fluctuations of the metric impact four-fermion interactions which mediate proton decay. We find that quantum gravity lowers the scaling dimension of the four-fermion interaction, suppressing proton decay and raising the proton lifetime significantly. As a special case, we analyze asymptotically safe quantum gravity, in which we discover that proton-decay-mediating four-fermion interactions are strictly zero.</description>

      <title>Chiral Analysis of the Nucleon Mass and Sigma Commutator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schemes for describing the light quark mass dependence of the nucleon mass calculated in lattice QCD are compared. The three schemes in consideration include a fully relativistic and Lorentz covariant scheme, one that is fully relativistic but not Lorentz covariant, and a semirelativistic scheme utilizing the heavy baryon approximation. Calculations of observables involving pseudoscalar meson loop diagrams generate nonanalytic terms proportional to square roots and logarithms of the quark mass. The three schemes all yield the correct model independent leading and next-to-leading nonanalytic terms of the chiral expansion of the baryon mass. Results for the masses of the other members of the octet are also presented. Here, low-energy coefficients of the analytic terms of the expansion for the nucleon and hyperons are constrained by lattice QCD results and are demonstrated to be independent of the renormalization scheme used. The differences in the leading coefficient of the chiral expansions are found to be consistent with strange quark counting. Using the schemes examined herein, we report results for the pion-nucleon sigma commutator based upon recent lattice results from the CLS Collaboration. We find $\sigma_{\pi N}=51.7 \pm 3.2 \pm 1.4$ MeV where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a generic source of stochastic gravitational wave background due to the parametric resonance of oscillating scalar fields in the early Universe. By systematically analyzing benchmark models through lattice simulations and considering a wide range of parameters, we demonstrate that such a scenario can lead to detectable signals in gravitational wave detectors over a broad frequency range and potentially address the recent findings by pulsar timing array experiments. Furthermore, these models naturally yield ultralight dark matter candidates or dark radiation detectable by cosmic microwave background observatories.</description>

      <title>Accumulating Hints for Flavour Violating Higgses at the Electroweak Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that supplementing the Standard Model by only a second Higgs doublet, a combined explanation of $h\to e\tau$, $h\to \mu\tau$, $b\to s \ell^+ \ell^-$, the $W$ mass and $R({D^{(*)}})$ as well as the excess in $t\to bH^+(130\,{\rm GeV})\to b\overline{b}c$ is possible. While this requires flavour violating couplings, the stringent bounds from e.g. $\mu\to e\gamma$, $\tau\to \mu\gamma$, $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing, $b\to s\gamma$, low mass di-jet and $pp\to H^+H^-\to \tau^+\tau^-\nu\bar\nu$ searches can be avoided. However, the model is very constrained, it inevitably predicts a shift in the SM Higgs coupling strength to tau leptons as well as a non-zero $t\to hc$ rate, as indeed preferred by recent measurements. We study three benchmark points providing such a simultaneous explanation and calculate their predictions, including collider signatures which can be tested with upcoming LHC run-3 data.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time for the alignment between quark spin and angular velocity in a rotating QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the relaxation times for massive quarks and anti-quarks to align their spins with the angular velocity in a rigidly rotating medium at finite temperature and baryon density. The rotation effects are implemented using a fermion propagator immersed in a cylindrical rotating environment. The relaxation time is computed as the inverse of the interaction rate to produce an asymmetry between the quark (anti-quark) spin components along and opposite to the angular velocity. For conditions resembling heavy-ion collisions, the relaxation times for quarks are smaller than for anti-quarks. For semi-central collisions the relaxation time is within the possible life-time of the QGP for all collision energies. However, for anti-quarks this happens only for collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\gtrsim 50$ GeV. The results are quantified in terms of the intrinsic quark and anti-quark polarizations, namely, the probability to build the spin asymmetry as a function of time. Our results show that these intrinsic polarizations tend to 1 with time at different rates given by the relaxation times with quarks reaching a sizable asymmetry at a faster pace. These are key results to further elucidate the mechanisms of hyperon polarization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Parameter optimisation using Bayesian inference for spallation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy and precision of high-energy spallation models are key issues for the design and development of new applications and experiments. We present a method to estimate model parameters and associated uncertainties by leveraging the Bayesian version of the Generalised Least Squares method, which enables us to incorporate prior knowledge on the parameter values. This approach is designed to adjust parameters based on experimental data, accounting for experimental uncertainty information, and providing uncertainties for all adjusted parameters. This approach is designed in order both to improve the accuracy of models through the modification of free parameters of these models, which results in a better reproduction of experimental data, and to estimate the uncertainties of these parameters and, by extension, their impacts on the model output. We aim at demonstrating the Generalised Least Square method can be applied in the case of Monte Carlo models. We present a proof-of-concept for Monte Carlo models in the specific case of nuclear physics with the model combination INCL/ABLA. We discuss the challenges in the application of this method to high-energy spallation models, notably the large runtime and the stochasticity of the models. Our results indicate this framework can also be applied to analogous situations where parameters of a computationally expensive Monte Carlo code should be inferred/improved.</description>

      <title>Study of angular observables in exclusive semileptonic $B_c$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate angular observables such as the longitudinal polarization of charged leptons, $\tau$-polarization, and forward-backward asymmetry in semileptonic $B_c$ decays. Additionally, we provide predictions for lepton flavor violating observables, the $\mathcal{R}$ ratios in the decay channels $B_c \rightarrow \eta_c (J/\psi) l \nu_l$ and $B_c \rightarrow D (D^*) l \nu_l$ across the entire $q^2$ region. Our analysis is conducted within the Relativistic Independent Quark Model, focusing on the potential model-dependent aspects of these observables. We compare our model predictions with existing lattice predictions, highlighting the strong applicability of our framework in describing $B_c$ decays. Considering the forthcoming experimental upgrades and the Run 3 data results on $B_c$ meson decays, rapid confirmation of these quantities could indicate significant discoveries of physics beyond the Standard Model. This will open up new avenues for understanding the complex flavor dynamics in heavy meson decays.</description>

      <title>Damping of density oscillations from bulk viscosity in quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the damping of density oscillations in the quark matter phase that might occur in compact stars. To this end we compute the bulk viscosity and the associated damping time in three-flavor quark matter, considering both nonleptonic and semileptonic electroweak processes. We use two different equations of state of quark matter, more precisely, the MIT bag model and perturbative QCD, including the leading-order corrections in the strong coupling constant. We analyze the dependence of our results on the density, temperature and value of strange quark mass in each case. We then find that the maximum of the bulk viscosity is in the range of temperature from 0.01 to 0.1 MeV for frequencies around 1 kHz, while the associated minimal damping times of the density oscillations at those temperatures might be in the range of few to hundreds milliseconds. Our results suggest that bulk viscous damping might be relevant in the postmerger phase after the collision of two neutron stars if deconfined matter is achieved in the process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter semi-annihilation is a process through which two dark matter candidates annihilate to a single dark matter particle and a non-dark matter particle. Such processes are common when the symmetry stabilizing the dark matter differs from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and can lead to qualitatively different phenomenology. In this work, we study the viability of semi-annihilation models including one or two inert multiplets. For one multiplet, we show that there does not exist any viable model in which semi-annihilation is efficient. For two multiplets, semi-annihilation can be efficient, but the number of viable and technically natural models is limited. We then perform a detailed study of the most promising model, showing that the correct relic abundance can be obtained for a wide range of masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Ultra)light spin-$1$ particles -- dark photons -- can constitute all of dark matter (DM) and have beyond Standard Model couplings. This can lead to a coherent, oscillatory signature in terrestrial detectors that depends on the coupling strength. We provide a signal analysis and statistical framework for inferring the properties of such DM by taking into account (i) the stochastic and (ii) the vector nature of the underlying field, along with (iii) the effects due to the Earth's rotation. Owing to equipartition, on time scales shorter than the coherence time the DM field vector typically traces out a fixed ellipse. Taking this ellipse and the rotation of the Earth into account, we highlight a distinctive three-peak signal in Fourier space that can be used to constrain DM coupling strengths. Accounting for all three peaks, we derive latitude-independent constraints on such DM couplings, unlike those stemming from single-peak studies. We apply our framework to the search for ultralight $B - L$ DM using optomechanical sensors, demonstrating the ability to delve into previously unprobed regions of this DM candidate's parameter space.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice quantum chromodynamics results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To mitigate the model dependencies of searches for new narrow resonances at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), semi-supervised Neural Networks (NNs) can be used. Unlike fully supervised classifiers these models introduce an additional look-elsewhere effect in the process of optimising thresholds on the response distribution. We perform a frequentist study to quantify this effect, in the form of a trials factor. As an example, we consider simulated $Z\gamma$ data to perform narrow resonance searches using semi-supervised NN classifiers. The results from this analysis provide substantiation that the look-elsewhere effect induced by the semi-supervised NN is under control.</description>

      <title>Impact of recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters on the effective Majorana neutrino mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pragmatic approach to lower down the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos in leptogenesis by introducing a scalar decaying to right-handed neutrinos. The key point of our proposal is that the out-of-equilibrium decays of the scalar provide an additional source for right-handed neutrinos and hence the lepton asymmetry. This mechanism works well at low temperatures when the washout of the generated lepton asymmetry is suppressed. Thus, the lepton asymmetry can be effectively produced despite the washout effect is strong or not. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that such a scalar-assisted leptogenesis can typically decrease the viable right-handed neutrino mass scale by two to four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background: birth from string-wall death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new source of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from the final collapse of a network of topological defects. Typically, the final collapse is considered negligible for generating gravitational waves (GWs) due to its subdominance compared with the network's long-term evolution in the scaling regime. However, in some cases, a network can be driven outside of horizon by inflation and later re-enter horizon. Then, the network's final collapse after re-entering horizon becomes the dominant GW source and therefore cannot be neglected. We demonstrate this phenomenon in the context of $N_{\rm DW}=1$ string-wall networks which naturally arise in axion models, although the framework can be generalized to other types of topological networks. The final collapse of walls bounded by strings releases GWs. Our calculation of the corresponding GW spectrum suggests it could be related to the first few bins of the nano-Hertz SGWB signal possibly detected by various Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. However, it is important to note that such GW spectrum falls within a relatively narrow frequency range, which may not completely account for the PTA signal that spans more than one order of magnitude in frequency. Furthermore, with different parameter choices, the resultant GWs generated in this mechanism could be probed by various GW interferometry experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel methodology to search for intranuclear neutron-antineutron transition ($n\rightarrow\bar{n}$) followed by $\bar{n}$-nucleon annihilation within an $^{40}$Ar nucleus, using the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector. A discovery of $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ transition or a new best limit on the lifetime of this process would either constitute physics beyond the Standard Model or greatly constrain theories of baryogenesis, respectively. The approach presented in this paper makes use of deep learning methods to select $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ events based on their unique features and differentiate them from cosmogenic backgrounds. The achieved signal and background efficiencies are (70.22$\pm$6.04)\% and (0.0020$\pm$0.0003)\%, respectively. A demonstration of a search is performed with a data set corresponding to an exposure of $3.32 \times10^{26}\,$neutron-years, and where the background rate is constrained through direct measurement, assuming the presence of a negligible signal. With this approach, no excess of events over the background prediction is observed, setting a demonstrative lower bound on the $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ lifetime in $^{40}$Ar of $\tau_{\textrm{m}} \gtrsim 1.1\times10^{26}\,$years, and on the free $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ transition time of $\tau_{\textrm{\nnbar}} \gtrsim 2.6\times10^{5}\,$s, each at the $90\%$ confidence level. This analysis represents a first-ever proof-of-principle demonstration of the ability to search for this rare process in LArTPCs with high efficiency and low background.</description>

      <title>$P_{tail}^{\alpha}$: a high resolution gamma/hadron and composition discriminant variable for Water-Cherenkov Detector cosmic-ray observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise and efficient identification of the nature of the primary cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis stands as a fundamental aspiration for any cosmic ray observatory. In particular, the detection and characterization of gamma ray events are challenged by their occurrence within an overwhelmingly greater flux of charged cosmic rays spanning several orders of magnitude. The intricacies of distinguishing between cosmic ray compositions and the inherent uncertainties associated with hadronic interactions present formidable challenges, which, if not properly addressed, can introduce significant sources of systematic errors. This work introduces a novel composition discriminant variable, $P_{tail}^{\alpha}$, which quantifies the number of Water Cherenkov Detectors with a signal well above the mean signal observed in WCDs located at an equivalent distance from the shower core, in events with approximately the same energy at the ground. This new event variable is then shown to be, in the reconstructed energy range $10\,{\rm TeV}$ to $1.6\,{\rm PeV}$, well correlated with the total number of muons that hit, in the same event, all the observatory stations located at a distance greater than $200\,{\rm m}$ from the shower core. The two variables should thus have similar efficiencies in the selection of high-purity gamma event samples and in the determination of the nature of charged cosmic ray events.</description>

      <title>The reggeon model with the pomeron and odderon: renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique. The single loop approximation is adopted.
  Five real fixed points are found and the high-energy behaviour of the propagators is correspondingly calculated. As without odderon, the asymptotic is modulated by logarithms of energy in certain rational powers. Movement of coupling constants away from the fixed points is investigated both analytically (close to the fixed points) and numerically (far away). In the former case attraction occurs only in restricted domains of initial coupling constants. More generally in one third of the cases the coupling constants instead grow large indicating the breakdown of the single loop approximation.</description>

      <title>Inflation, the Hubble Tension and Early Dark Energy: an alternative overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I review and discuss the possible implications for inflation resulting from considering new physics in light of the Hubble tension. My study is motivated by a simple argument that the constraints on inflationary parameters, most typically the spectral index $n_s$, depend to some extent on the cosmological framework. To avoid broadening the uncertainties resulting from marginalizing over additional parameters (typical in many alternative models), I first adopt the same alternative viewpoint of previous studies and analyze what happens if a physical theory can fix extra parameters to non-standard values. Focusing on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm{eff}}$, I confirm that physical theories able to fix $w \approx -1.2$ or $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.9$ produce values of $H_0$ from CMB and BAO in line with the local distance ladder estimate. While in the former case I do not find any relevant implications for inflation, in the latter scenarios, I observe a shift towards $n_s \approx 1$. From a model-selection perspective, both cases are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM. However, models with $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.3 - 3.4$ could bring the $H_0$ tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$ while being moderately disfavored. Yet, this is enough to change the constraints on inflation so that the most accredited models (e.g., Starobinsky inflation) would no longer be favored by data. I then focus on Early Dark Energy (EDE), arguing that an EDE fraction $f_{\rm{EDE}}\sim 0.04 - 0.06$ (only able to mildly reduce the $H_0$-tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$) could already require a similar change in perspective on inflation. In fact, performing a full joint analysis of EDE and Starobinsky inflation, I find that the two models can hardly coexist for $f_{\rm{EDE}}\gtrsim 0.06$.</description>

      <title>Structure of Massive Gauge/Gravity Scattering Amplitudes, Equivalence Theorems, and Extended Double-Copy with Compactified Warped Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in the compactified 5-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. We present systematic formulations of the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) for warped KK theories in $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, where the GAET connects the scattering amplitudes of longitudinal KK gauge bosons to that of the corresponding KK Goldstone bosons and the GRET connects the scattering amplitudes of KK gravitons of helicity-zero (helicity-one) to that of the corresponding gravitational KK Goldstone bosons. We analyze the structure of 3-point and 4-point scattering amplitudes of massive KK gauge bosons and of massive KK gravitons as well as their corresponding Goldstone bosons. We first prove the GAET and GRET explicitly for the fundamental 3-point KK gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes. We then demonstrate that the validity of the GAET and GRET for 4-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes can be reduced to the validity of GAET and GRET for 3-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes at tree level. With these, we study the double-copy construction of KK scattering amplitudes in the warped gauge/gravity theories. We newly realize the double-copy for massive 3-point full gauge/gravity amplitudes at tree level under proper correspondences of color-kinematics and of gauge/gravity couplings, whereas we can construct the double-copy for 4-point KK gauge/gravity amplitudes to the leading order (LO) of high energy expansion. We further demonstrate that this LO double-copy construction can be extended to $N$-point KK scattering amplitudes with $N\geqslant 4$.</description>
