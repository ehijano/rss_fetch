      <title>Digital Business Model Analysis Using a Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital transformation (DX) has recently become a pressing issue for many companies as the latest digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, can be easily utilized. However, devising new business models is not easy for compa-nies, though they can improve their operations through digital technologies. Thus, business model design support methods are needed by people who lack digital tech-nology expertise. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT and natural language processing utilizing LLMs have been developed revolutionarily. A business model design support system that utilizes these technologies has great potential. However, research on this area is scant. Accordingly, this study proposes an LLM-based method for comparing and analyzing similar companies from different business do-mains as a first step toward business model design support utilizing LLMs. This method can support idea generation in digital business model design.</description>

      <title>Generalized "Square roots of Not" matrices, their application to the unveiling of hidden logical operators and to the definition of fully matrix circular Euler functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06067v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The square root of Not is a logical operator of importance in quantum computing theory and of interest as a mathematical object in its own right. In physics, it is a square complex matrix of dimension 2. In the present work it is a complex square matrix of arbitrary dimension. The introduction of linear algebra into logical theory has been enhanced in recent decades by the researches in the field of neural networks and quantum computing. Here we will make a brief description of the representation of logical operations through matrices and we show how general expressions for the two square roots of the Not operator are obtained. Then, we explore two topics. First, we study an extension to a non-quantum domain of a short form of Deutsch's algorithm. Then, we assume that a root of Not is a matrix extension of the imaginary unit i, and under this idea we obtain fully matrix versions for the Euler expansions and for the representations of circular functions by complex exponentials.</description>
