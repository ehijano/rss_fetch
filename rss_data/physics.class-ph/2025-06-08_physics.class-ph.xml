      <title>On the motion of a point charge in a plate capacitor considering influence effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A point charge between the plates of a capacitor generates an influence charge distribution on the plates that modify the electric field acting upon the point charge. This effect is described by the well-known Dirichlet Green's function for the two parallel conducting plate problem for which we derive an infinite mirror charge series representation. At the line perpendicular to the plates and passing through the point charge this Green's function and hence the total force can be explicitly evaluated in terms of the psi function. For the motion of the point charge we develop an analytical approximation and compare it with the numerical integration of the exact equations of motion. The correction due to influence effects is shown to be of order $O(-\lambda \log \lambda)$ where $\lambda$ denotes the relative strength of the Green's function compared with the pure capacitor potential.</description>

      <title>Defect-free and defective adaptations of crystalline sheets to stretching deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic response of the crystalline sheet to the stretching deformation in the form of wrinkles has been extensively investigated. In this work, we extend this fundamental scientific question to the plastic regime by exploring the adaptations of crystalline sheets to the large uniaxial mechanical stretching. We reveal the intermittent plastic shear deformations leading to the complete fracture of the sheets wrapping the cylinder. Specifically, systematic investigations of crystalline sheets of varying geometry show that the fracture processes can be classified into defect-free and defective categories depending on the emergence of topological defects. We highlight the characteristic mechanical and geometric patterns in response to the large stretching deformation, including the shear-driven intermittent lattice tilting, the vortex structure in the displacement field, and the emergence of mobile and anchored dislocations as plastic excitations. The effects of noise and initial lattice orientation on the plastic deformation of the stretched crystalline sheet are also discussed. These results advance our understanding of the atomic level on the irreversible plastic instabilities of 2D crystals under large uniaxial stretching and may have potential practical implications in the precise engineering of structural instabilities in packings of covalently bonded particulate systems.</description>

      <title>Plasma Frequency of Wire Medium Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits a model for the plasma frequency of a simple wire medium formed by a square lattice of parallel metallic wires. We provide a comparative analysis of existing formulas for estimating the plasma frequency and derive a new expression taking into account the second-order correction by the period to wavelength ratio. The proposed formula demonstrates superior accuracy for thin wires, with a relative error of less than $0.16\%$ for ratio of wires radii to period smaller than $0.13$, significantly outperforming previously known results in this range.</description>

      <title>Effect of interparticle fields and radiation reaction on beam dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where the adiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. However, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, particularly during coherent emission. Here we present (i) an analytical proof showing that the energy-momentum conservation law of the Hamilton-Rohrlich-Dirac action, which is divergence free and describes a generic system of interacting charges, respects causality and provides physically sensible results; (ii) a simple generalization of the LL equation for many particles evaluated as a function of the total field, i.e., the sum of the external and interparticle fields. By performing first-principles numerical simulations of a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, this theory is shown to satisfy energy-momentum conservation when interparticle fields and RR are simultaneously taken into account; and (iii) the combined effect of interparticle fields and RR primarily affects the tail of the particle energy distribution. Additionally, our first-principles simulations show that the effect of interparticle fields on beam energy loss becomes smaller when most of the radiated energy is incoherent.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>
