      <title>Binding Kinetics Oppositely Regulates type II Topoisomerase Relaxation and Decatenation Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II Topoisomerases (topo II) are critical to simplify genome topology during transcription and replication. They identify topological problems and resolve them by passing a double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in another segment. The precise mechanisms underpinning topo IIs ability to maintain a topologically simple genome are not fully understood. Here, we investigate how binding kinetics affects the resolution of two distinct forms of topological entanglement: decatenation and torsional relaxation. First, by single-molecule measurements, we quantify how monovalent cation concentration affects the dissociation rate of topo II from DNA. Second, we discover that increasing dissociation rates accelerate decatenation while slowing down relaxation catalytic activities. Finally, by using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that this opposite behaviour is due to a trade-off between search of target through facilitated diffusion and processivity of the enzyme in catenated versus supercoiled DNA. Thus, our findings reveal that a modulation of topo II binding kinetics can oppositely regulate its topological simplification activity, and in turn can have a significant impact in vivo.</description>

      <title>Activation of Polylactic Acid and Polycarbonate Surfaces with Non-Thermal Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-thermal plasma (NTP) surface activation has become a powerful and versatile strategy to engineer the interfacial properties of biomedical polymers whose intrinsic hydrophobicity limits their biological performance. In polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC), NTP promotes the controlled incorporation of polar functional groups, increases surface energy, modifies dielectric behavior, and generates micro-roughness that collectively enhance protein adsorption and early cell adhesion. This review synthesizes and critically evaluates evidence across four complementary analytical pillars-contact-angle theory, dielectric impedance spectroscopy, FT-IR chemical mapping, and optical microscopy-to construct an integrated framework for interpreting plasma-induced chemical and morphological transformations.
  The convergence of multimodal results demonstrates that NTP consistently produces chemically active, polar, and moderately textured surfaces that support robust initial cell-material interactions. Furthermore, combining wettability, dielectric, and spectroscopic analysis enables the identification of activation pathways, the assessment of hydrophobic recovery dynamics, and the development of quantitative correlations between dielectric parameters and biological response. However, the literature also reveals key methodological gaps, including the limited use of unified multimodal protocols, insufficient evaluation of temporal stability, and a lack of predictive dielectric-biological models.
  By articulating these advances and limitations within a unified conceptual scheme, this review provides a roadmap for future research aimed at standardizing characterization workflows and enabling the rational design of next-generation plasma-functionalized biomaterials for tissue-engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and advanced drug-delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Parallel accelerated electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy using diamond sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center can serve as a magnetic sensor for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. Benefiting from its atomic size, the diamond chip can integrate a tremendous amount of NV centers to improve the magnetic-field sensitivity. However, EPR spectroscopy using NV ensembles is less efficient due to inhomogeneities in both sensors and targets. Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensor's inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the target's inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of roughly 30000 NV centers. Our method shows the ability to not only acquire unambiguous EPR spectra of free radicals, but also monitor their spectroscopic dynamics in real time.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning three-factor plasticity rules for structured credit assignment with sparse feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical closed-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>

      <title>Origins of Instability in Dynamical Systems on Undirected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness to perturbation is a key topic in the study of complex systems occurring across a wide variety of applications from epidemiology to biochemistry. Here we analyze the eigenspectrum of the Jacobian matrices associated to a general class of networked dynamical systems, which contains information on how perturbations to a stationary state develop over time. We find that stability is always determined by a spectral outlier, but with pronounced differences to the corresponding eigenvector in different regimes. We show that, depending on model details, instability may originate in nodes of anomalously low or high degree, or may occur everywhere in the network at once. Importantly, the dependence on extremal degrees results in considerable finite-size effects with different scaling depending on the ensemble degree distribution. Our results have potentially useful applications in network monitoring to predict or prevent catastrophic failures, and we validate our analytical findings through applications to epidemic dynamics and gene regulatory systems.</description>

      <title>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Ocular Surface Changes with Contact Lens Wear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over 140 million people worldwide and over 45 million people in the United States wear contact lenses; it is estimated that 12%-27.4% contact lens users stop wearing them due to discomfort. Contact lens mechanical interactions with the ocular surface have been found to affect the ocular surface itself. These mechanical interactions are difficult to measure and calculate in a clinical setting, and the research in this field is limited. This paper presents the first mathematical model that captures the interactions between the contact lens and the open eye, where the contact lens configuration, the contact lens suction pressure, and the deformed ocular shape are all emergent properties of the model. The non-linear coupling between the contact lens and the eye is achieved by assuming that the suction pressure under the lens is applied directly to the ocular surface through the post-lens tear film layer. The contact lens mechanics are modeled using a previous published model. We consider homogeneous and heterogeneous linear elastic eye models, different ocular shapes, different lens shapes and thickness profiles, and extract lens deformations, suction pressure profiles, and ocular deformations and stresses for all the considered scenarios. The model predicts higher ocular deformations and stresses at the center of the eye and in the limbal/scleral regions. Accounting for heterogeneous material eye parameters increases the magnitude of such deformations and stresses. The ocular displacements and stresses non-linearly increase as we increase the stiffness of the contact lens. Inserting a steeper contact lens on the eye results in a reduction of the ocular displacement at the center of the eye and a larger displacement at the edge of the contact lens. The model predictions are compared with experimental data and previously developed mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Metastable phase separation and information retrieval in multicomponent mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Matter in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>
