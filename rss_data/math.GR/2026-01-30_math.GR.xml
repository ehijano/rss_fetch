      <title>Filtrations and cohomology on graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We resolve a question posed by Min\'a\v{c}-Rogelstad-T\^an. We relate the Zassenhaus and the lower central series of pro-$p$ groups under a torsion-freeness condition.
  We also study graph products of (pro-$p$) groups under natural assumptions. In particular, we compute their graded Lie algebras associated with the previous filtrations, as well as their cohomology over $\mathbb{F}_p$. Our approach relies on various filtrations of amalgamated products, as studied in Leoni's PhD thesis. Explicit examples are provided using the Koszul property.
  As a concrete application, we compute the cohomology over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and the graded Lie algebras associated with the filtrations of graph products of fundamental groups of surfaces. These groups furnish new examples satisfying the torsion-freeness condition, which arises in the question of Min\'a\v{c}-Rogelstad-T\^an.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a,b$ be positive integers. In this note, we study the numerical semigroup $H=\left&lt;a,a+1,b\right&gt;$ and and the associated numerical semigroup ring $R=k[[H]]$. Under the certain conditions, we provide explicit formulas for the Frobenius number of $H$ and for the first Hilbert coefficient of $R$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative versions of Pansu Asymptotic Theorem and of Mitchell Tangent Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantitatively study the speed of convergence of geodesic Lie groups to their metric limits. For nilpotent geodesic Lie groups, we give estimates on the difference of the original metrics and the asymptotic metrics, while for general geodesic Lie groups, we give similar estimates for the difference of the original metrics and the tangent metrics. In both settings, our results sharpen existing bounds in the literature.</description>

      <title>Reduction theorems for a conjecture on basis in source algebras of blocks of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this short research note is to present some results about a conjecture of Barker and Gelvin claiming that any source algebra of a block of a finite group has the unit group containing a basis stabilised by the left and right actions of the defect group. We obtain some reduction theorems for the existence of stable unital basis in source algebras of block algebras. Along the way we investigate this problem for the blocks of some finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Synchronization points: growth, asymptotics, congruences, and the synchronization zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the synchronization zeta function associated with a pair of self-maps of a topological space and investigate its properties. We also define the growth rate of synchronization points and derive an explicit formula in the setting of endomorphisms of compact, connected Abelian groups. In addition, we establish Gauss congruences and describe the asymptotic behavior for the sequence of numbers of synchronization points, under the assumption that the synchronization zeta function is rational. Further, we discuss connections with topological entropy and Reidemeister torsion.</description>

      <title>Projective reflection groups of finite covolume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Coxeter polytopes that have finite volume in their Vinberg domains are exactly the quasiperfect Coxeter polytopes of negative type, i.e. the Coxeter polytopes that are contained in their properly convex Vinberg domain, at the exception of some vertices that are C^1 points of the boundary. As a corollary, we show that for reflection groups \`a la Vinberg, the Vinberg domain is the only invariant properly convex domain if and only if the action is of finite covolume on the Vinberg domain and the dimension is at least 2.</description>

      <title>Canonical Join Representations and Join-irreducible elements of Garside shadows in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish some new combinatorial properties of elements in Coxeter groups. Firstly, we generalise Reading's theorem on the canonical join representations of elements in finite Coxeter groups to all finitely generated Coxeter groups.
  Secondly, we show that for any element $x$ in a Coxeter group $W$ and root $\beta$ in its inversion set $\Phi(x)$, the set of elements $y \in W$ satisfying $\Phi(x) \cap \Phi(y) = \{ \beta \} $ is convex in the weak order and admits a unique minimal representative. This is strongly connected to determining the cone type of elements of $W$ and leads to efficient computational methods to determine whether arbitrary elements of $W$ have the same cone type.</description>

      <title>On the generalised Saxl graphs of permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A base for a finite permutation group $G \le \mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ is a subset of $\Omega$ with trivial pointwise stabiliser in $G$, and the base size of $G$ is the smallest size of a base for $G$. Motivated by the interest in groups of base size two, Burness and Giudici introduced the notion of the Saxl graph. This graph has vertex set $\Omega$, with edges between elements if they form a base for $G$. We define a generalisation of this graph that encodes useful information about $G$ whenever $b(G) \ge 2$: here, the edges are the pairs of elements of $\Omega$ that can be extended to bases of size $b(G)$. In particular, for primitive groups, we investigate the completeness and arc-transitivity of the generalised graph, and the generalisation of Burness and Giudici's Common Neighbour Conjecture on the original Saxl graph.</description>

      <title>On the Bogomolov-Positselski Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. An oriented pro-$p$ group $(G,\theta)$ is said to have the Bogomolov--Positselski property if it is Kummerian and if $I_\theta(G)$ is a free pro-$p$ group. In this paper, we provide a new criterion for an oriented pro-$p$ group to satisfy the Bogomolov--Positselski property. This criterion builds on earlier work of Positselski (arXiv:1405.0965) and Quadrelli--Weigel (arXiv:2103.12438), relates their approaches, and answers a question raised in (arXiv:2103.12438).
  Under additional assumptions, we obtain two further sufficient criteria. The first is analogous to a Merkurjev--Suslin type statement. The second allows one to weaken the hypotheses appearing in Positselski's criterion (arXiv:1405.0965 Theorem 2). Finally, we show that the stronger conditions are satisfied by pro-$p$ groups of elementary type. As a consequence, the Elementary Type Conjecture implies Positselski's ``Module Koszulity Conjecture 1'' (arXiv:1008.0095) for fields with finitely generated maximal pro-$p$ Galois group.</description>

      <title>A Manual for Ends, Semistability and Simple Connectivity at Infinity for Groups and Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This $2^{nd}$-edition article is intended to be an up-to-date archive of the current state of the questions: Which finitely generated groups $G$: have semistable fundamental group at infinity; are simply connected at infinity; are such that $H^2(G,\mathbb ZG)$ is free abelian or trivial. The idea is not to reprove these results, but to provide a historical record of the progress on these questions and provide a list of the most general results. We also prove or cite all of the results that make up the basic theory. The first Chapter is devoted to ends of groups and spaces, and the second to semistability at infinity, simple connectivity at infinity and second cohomology of groups. Definitions, basic facts and lists of general results are given in each Chapter. A number of results proven here are new and a number of authors have contributed results. We end with an Index for simply connected at infinity groups and an Index of Groups and Subgroups which is intended to help a reader quickly locate results about certain types of groups/subgroups. The main updates from the first edition is section 2.4.5 on mapping class groups and the addition of the simply connected at infinity index.</description>

      <title>Zariski-dense surface groups in non-uniform lattices of split real Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $\textrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ ($n\geq3$), $\textrm{SO}(n+1,n)$ ($n\geq2$), $\textrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ ($n\geq2$) and for the adjoint real split form of the exceptional group $\textrm{G}_2$, we exhibit non-uniform lattices in which we construct thin Hitchin representations by arithmetic methods. These representations give infinitely many orbits under the action of the mapping class group (except maybe for $\textrm{G}_2$). In particular, we show that when $p\neq2$ is prime every non-uniform lattice of $\mathrm{SL}(p,\mathbb{R})$ contains thin Hitchin representations.</description>

      <title>Property (T) and Poincar\'e duality in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a recent result of Bader and Sauer on coboundary expansion to prove residually finite three-dimensional Poincar\'e duality groups never have property (T). This implies such groups are never K\"ahler. The argument applies to fundamental groups of (possibly non-aspherical) compact 3-manifolds, giving a new proof of a theorem of Fujiwara that states if the fundamental group of a compact 3-manifold has property (T), then that group is finite. The only consequence of geometrization needed in the proof is that 3-manifold groups are residually finite.</description>
