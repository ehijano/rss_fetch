      <title>Applied Astrobiology: An Integrated Approach to the Future of Life in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for extraterrestrial life and supporting human life in space are traditionally regarded as separate challenges. However, there are significant benefits to an approach that treats them as different aspects of the same essential inquiry: How can we conceptualize life beyond our home planet?</description>

      <title>Some Historical Misconceptions and Inaccuracies Regarding The 1908 Tunguska Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a series of works, devoted to various aspects of the 1908 Tunguska event. A large number of hypotheses about its causes have been put forward already. However, so far none of them has received convincing evidence. This is probably why new hypotheses appear almost every year, not only in the mass-media, but also in scientific literature. At the same time, any hypothesis should not contradict the known facts about the event. Unfortunately, the authors of new hypotheses, as well as the authors of popular science articles, often use data, many of which turned out to be not entirely accurate, or even incorrect. In this paper some of this data will be considered. Also the history of the Tunguska research is considered in this paper. Some other aspects of the 1908 Tunguska event are considered too.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Demon in Szilard's Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.</description>
