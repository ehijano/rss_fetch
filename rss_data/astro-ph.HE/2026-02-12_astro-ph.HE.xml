      <title>TDE 2025abcr: A Tidal Disruption Event in the Outskirts of a Massive Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have traditionally been discovered in optical sky surveys through targeted searches of nuclear transients. However, it is expected that some TDEs will occur outside the galaxy nucleus, arising from wandering black holes originating in galaxy mergers. Here we present observations of TDE 2025abcr, the first optical TDE discovered in the outskirts of a host galaxy. The TDE was identified by a custom 'off-nuclear' implementation of the ML classifier $\texttt{tdescore}$, which classifies new ZTF transients based on their lightcurves. Follow-up observations confirm that TDE 2025abcr is a TDE-H+He, occurring 9.5$"$ (10.3 kpc projected distance) from the nucleus of a massive galaxy ($\mathrm{M}_{\star}$ = $10^{11.18 \pm 0.03}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) with a central black hole mass of $10^{8.82 \pm 0.65}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. TDE 2025abcr itself was likely disrupted by a much lighter black hole ($10^{6.09\pm0.53}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, as estimated with peak luminosity scaling relations). The black hole was either dynamically ejected from the nucleus or lies at the center of a very faint tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy undergoing a minor merger. Late-time observations of TDE 2025abcr could confirm the origin of this apparent 'orphan' black hole. The rate of highly offset ($\gtrsim$3 kpc) TDEs can be constrained to $&lt;$10% of the nuclear TDE rate, but our discovery implies that many dozens of similar sources will be detected by the Vera C. Rubin each year with resolvable offsets.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Methods for Stellar Collisions. I. Predicting Outcomes of SPH Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar collisions can occur frequently in dense cluster environments, and play a crucial role in producing exotic phenomena from blue stragglers in globular clusters to high-energy transients in galactic nuclei. Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\%$ and $0.15\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively. We make our trained models publicly available as part of the package collAIder, enabling rapid predictions of stellar collision outcomes in $N$-body models of dense star cluster dynamics.</description>

      <title>New Deep Radio Continuum Imaging Still Indicates a Large Reservoir of Undiscovered Millisecond Pulsars in Terzan 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the deepest and highest-resolution radio continuum imaging of the Galactic globular cluster Terzan 5, one of the most crowded locations in the radio sky. In these new 2$-$4 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array images, we detect 38 of the 49 confirmed pulsars, including extensive multi-frequency eclipse mapping of the luminous redback Ter5A. Nonetheless, there is still a large amount of diffuse residual flux from pulsars that are fainter than our 2.5 GHz continuum detection limit of $\sim 11\,\mu$Jy. Using a range of approaches including image-based simulations, we model the fluxes of the detected pulsars together with the residual flux. We find a minimum total population of $N\sim250$ detectable pulsars in Terzan 5 and perhaps substantially more, though the luminosity function remains very uncertain. Consideration of the $\gamma$-ray properties of the cluster, though also not unambiguous to interpret, leads to consistent conclusions. These pulsar population estimates are larger than inferred from previous work and highlight Terzan 5 as a keystone target for next-generation radio facilities.</description>

      <title>Evidence for neutrino emission from X-ray Bright Seyfert Galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere using Enhanced Starting Track Events with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube recently reported the observation of TeV neutrinos from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC~1068, and the corresponding neutrino flux is significantly higher than the upper limit implied by observations of GeV-TeV gamma rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced near the supermassive black hole, where the radiation density is high enough to obscure gamma rays. We use a set of muon neutrinos with interaction vertices inside the detector, which have good sensitivity to sources in the Southern sky, from IceCube data recorded between 2011 and 2021. We then search for individual and collective neutrino signals from 14 Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky selected from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN Spectroscopic Survey. Using the correlations between keV X-rays and TeV neutrinos predicted by disk-corona models, and assuming production characteristics similar to NGC~1068, a collective neutrino signal search reveals an excess of $6.7_{-3.2}^{+4.0}$ events, which is inconsistent with background expectations at the 3$\sigma$ level of significance. In this paper, we present new independent evidence that Seyfert galaxies contribute to the extragalactic flux of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>On the Expected Orbitally-modulated TeV Signatures of Spider Binaries: The Effect of Intrabinary Shock Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 'Spider' binary systems - black widow and redback compact binaries differentiated by their companion's mass and nature - are an important type of pulsar system exhibiting a rich empirical phenomenology, including radio eclipses, optical light curves from a heated companion, as well as non-thermal X-ray and GeV orbital light curves and spectra. Multi-wavelength observations have now resulted in the detection of &gt;~50 of these systems in which a millisecond pulsar heats and ablates its low-mass companion via its intense pulsar wind. Broadband observations have established the presence of relativistic leptons that have been accelerated in the pulsar magnetosphere and near the intrabinary shock, as well as a hot companion, presenting an ideal environment for the creation of orbitally-modulated inverse Compton fluxes that should be within reach of current and future Cherenkov telescopes. We have included an updated synchrotron kernel, different parametric injection spectral shapes, and several intrabinary shock geometries in our emission code to improve our predictions of the expected TeV signatures from spider binaries. Our updated phase-dependent spectral and energy-dependent light curve outputs may aid in constraining particle energetics, wind properties, shock geometry, and system inclination of several spider binaries.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Evolution of the HI Spin Temperature with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) emit broad band radio wave radiation that may, in rare cases, encode atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption signals produced as they traverse the interstellar medium of their host galaxies. Combining such signals with high resolution HI emission maps offers a unique opportunity to probe the dynamics of neutral gas at cosmological distances through constraints of the HI excitation temperature $T_{spin}$, which characterises the balance of neutral gas phases and the underlying thermal processes within these galactic environments. While no absorption signal has been recorded in an FRB to date, we demonstrate a proof of concept with the bright (F = 35 Jy ms) and narrow (0.2 ms) FRB 20211127I detected by ASKAP. We find a 3${\sigma}$ upper limit on the integrated optical depth in the pulse-averaged spectrum of 33 km s$^{-1}$, and, based on the HI emission observed in a 3 hr MeerKAT L-band observation, subsequently find a lower limit on $T_{spin}$ of 26 K. While this test case provides little constraining power, we find that narrow, non-repeating FRBs with fluences greater than 20/70/150 Jy ms observed with all dishes with the current MeerKAT/ASKAP/DSA telescopes can probe integrated optical depths below 5 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we highlight that utilising FAST's incredible sensitivity to stack thousands of bursts from hyperactive repeaters also provides a plausible avenue through which HI absorption, and hence $T_{spin}$, can be measured. Finally, we discuss how HI absorption can address several modern challenges in FRB science, providing a physical anchor for locating bursts within their host galaxies and helping to disentangle the host contribution to dispersion and scattering.</description>

      <title>A 682-second X-ray Periodicity in CH Cygni: Evidence for a Magnetic White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries consisting of a red giant and typically a white dwarf, important as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. Despite theoretical predictions that white dwarfs in symbiotic systems should often be magnetic, direct evidence has been elusive. We report the discovery of a $682.5 \pm 7$ s periodicity in the XMM-Newton X-ray light curve that we interpret as the spin period of the WD in CH Cygni. This detection provides strong evidence for a magnetic white dwarf in CH Cygni, making it only the second WD symbiotic star with confirmed X-ray pulsations after R Aquarii. Our discovery supports the magnetic propeller model previously proposed for CH Cygni's jet activity and state transitions.</description>

      <title>First Detection of $\gamma$-Ray Emission from the Compact Symmetric Object JVAS J1311+1658</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of $\gamma$-ray emission from the young radio galaxy JVAS~J1311+1658, classified as a compact symmetric object (CSO). This detection is characterized by a recent GeV $\gamma$-ray flare identified in Fermi-LAT data during MJD~60032.6--60132.6, with a $\gamma$-ray source detected at a significance level of $\sim6.2\sigma$. The average 0.1--300~GeV flux is measured to be $(1.6 \pm 0.6)\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, with a photon spectral index of $\Gamma = 2.15 \pm 0.185$. We find that a radiative model of the radio lobes significantly underestimates the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. The strong flux and short-term variability over $\sim$100 days suggest that the emission likely originates from newly launched sub-kiloparsec-scale jets at the core. This detection provides a unique window into the extreme environments and early-stage jet activity of young radio galaxies, offering insights into their initial evolution and the formation of relativistic jets in the earliest phases of galaxy growth.</description>

      <title>Linking {\it Fermi} blazars and radio galaxies through accretion and jet radiation mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the classical unification, blazars, namely BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), are believed to correspond with radio galaxies when observed at small jet viewing angles. In this paper, we aim to compile a sample of Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to provide new insights towards a unified accretion and ejection scenario between aligned and misaligned radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), by considering their optical emission-line classifications (low- and high-excitation radio galaxies, LERGs, HERGs), which are more representative of their accretion states. We adopted statistical analyses of accretion properties and high-energy beaming patterns for both Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to investigate a unified accretion-ejection scenario. In the gamma-ray luminosity-photon index plane, HERGs populate the region of higher luminosities and softer photon indices, akin to FSRQs, whereas LERGs fill lower luminosities with harder photon indices, analogous to BL Lacs. This parallel segregation indicates that LERGs and HERGs represent the misaligned counterparts of BL Lacs and FSRQs, respectively. The unified picture is further supported by the Compton dominance-photon index diagram, where FSRQs and HERGs dominated by external Compton (EC) emissions are distinctly separated from BL Lacs and LERGs governed by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emissions. Similarly, the diagram of accretion rate versus gamma-ray photon index reveals two distinct accretion-ejection states: a low-accretion-rate branch (BL Lacs and LERGs) is associated with the SSC model, and a high-accretion-rate branch (FSRQs and HERGs) is linked to the EC model. These results strongly strengthen the idea of a unified accretion and ejection paradigm between blazars and radio galaxies into two distinct states.</description>

      <title>Distance Estimation and Sky Localization of Eccentric Double White Dwarf Binaries from Gravitational Wave Observations inside Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic distance scale is built on multiple different techniques for estimating distances in space that are often connected and dependent on multiple measurements and assumptions. Double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) are common objects and are expected to produce gravitational wave (GW) signals that can be observed with space-based detectors such as LISA. By analyzing these signals we should be able to estimate the distance and sky location of the source. Previous studies have done this for circular binaries which, while they are abundant, have, in general, weaker signals than eccentric binaries and it is not possible to differentiate whether a circular binary is in the field or in a dense environment such as a globular cluster (GC). In this paper we used eccentric binaries from MOCCA GC simulations, simulated the GW signal from each binary at locations related to GCs in the Milky Way and estimated the precision on the distance and the sky location of the source. We find that distances can be estimated with higher precision than current day methods even with low eccentricity binaries and higher eccentricity further increases this precision. Although the probability of finding a tight and eccentric DWD is far lower than a circular one, we can expect to find at least a few in the dense environments of the Milky Way, such as GCs. These estimations would be independent measurements with high precision to objects inside dense environments, such as GCs inside the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds.</description>

      <title>GECAM discovery of the second FRB-associated Magnetar X-ray Burst from SGR J1935+2154</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio burst (FRB) is mysterious phenomenon with millisecond-duration radio pulses observed mostly from cosmological distance. The association between FRB 200428 and a magnetar X-ray burst (MXB) from SGR J1935+2154 has significantly advanced the understanding of FRB and magnetar bursts. However, it is uncertain whether this association between MXB and FRB (i.e. MXB/FRB 200428) is genuine or just coincidental only based on this single event. Here we report the discovery of a bright ($\rm\sim7.6\times10^{-7}\,erg \cdot cm^{-2}$ in 1-250 keV) magnetar X-ray burst detected by GECAM on October 14th, 2022 (dubbed as MXB 221014) from SGR J1935+2154, which is associated with a FRB detected by CHIME and GBT. We conducted a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of MXB 221014 with GECAM data and find that it is a bright and typical ($T_{90}\sim$250 ms) X-ray burst from this magnetar. Interestingly, we find two narrow X-ray pulses in the MXB, one of which temporally aligns with the main pulse of the FRB 221014 $\sim5.70$ ms latter than the peak time of FRB 221014), resembling the feature found in MXB/FRB 200428. Furthermore, we did comprehensive comparison between MXB/FRB 221014 and MXB/FRB 200428, and find that while the two events share several common features, they also exhibit distinct differences, highlighting the variety of the MXB-FRB association morphology. This finding not only confirms the association between MXB and FRB but also provides new insights into the mechanism of and the relationship between FRB and MXB.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Formation Channel for Galactic Dual-Line Gravitational-Wave Sources: von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effect in Triples Involving Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense Galactic Center environment is expected to host compact binary inspirals detectable by future space-borne gravitational wave (GW) observatories (e.g., LISA, TianQin, Taiji) in the millihertz band. Aided by information from these facilities, next-generation ground-based GW detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) can potentially capture gravitational radiation in the hectohertz band from rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) components in such binaries. These Galactic Center systems are thus anticipated to act as dual-line (i.e., low-frequency inspiral and high-frequency spin) GW sources. However, the formation channels of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this \textit{Letter}, we propose that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect can enhance the formation of dual-line GW sources in hierarchical triples involving the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. We show that ZLK-driven oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary can modulate the GW emission from both the binary inspiral and the individual NS spins. This effect boosts the expected dual-line source count by a factor of $\sim 3$, from rare to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in 4 years, making dual-line observations substantially more probable. Our results demonstrate that the ZLK effect provides an important formation channel for Galactic dual-line GW sources.</description>

      <title>X-ray stellar feedback in low-metallicity starbursts: Insights from the template starburst galaxy ESO 338-IG04 and its halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray output of low-metallicity starburst galaxies is a key component of stellar feedback, tracing the processes responsible for gas ionization and chemical enrichment. The integrated X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) from high-mass X-ray binaries in star-forming galaxies scales with both the star formation rate (SFR) and host-galaxy metallicity $Z$. Due to the inverse correlation between $L_X/\mathrm{SFR}$ and $Z$, the contribution of X-ray binaries to the ionizing photon budget is enhanced in metal-poor systems and may ionize He II in the surrounding interstellar medium, powering nebular He II $\lambda4686$ emission. The blue compact dwarf galaxy ESO 338-IG04 (ESO 338-4) provides a nearby laboratory for studying stellar feedback in a low-metallicity starburst, combining vigorous recent star formation, low metallicity ($12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})\approx7.9$), and a rich population of massive stellar clusters. We characterize the X-ray emission of ESO 338-4 and its halo using new deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We analyze X-ray spectra, light curves, and images to constrain the nature of its X-ray sources. We identify five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and diffuse hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Two ULXs are spatially associated with stellar clusters. The total X-ray luminosity exceeds $10^{41}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. The brightest source, ULX1, shows variability on day timescales and lacks a stellar-cluster counterpart. Photoionization modeling shows that X-ray sources significantly impact the ionizing photon budget; models with ULX1 as the ionizing source predict nebular He II $\lambda4686$ luminosities of $\sim10^{39}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Population Properties of Binary Black Holes with Eccentricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The improved sensitivity of Gravitational-Wave detectors and the development of eccentric waveform models enable us to explore the growing catalog of gravitational-wave events with measurable eccentricity. This opens new opportunities to gain insight into the formation channels and evolutionary pathways of compact binary systems using eccentricity. However, most recent population analyses have been limited to quasi-circular binaries, primarily due to constraints in waveform modeling and sensitivity estimates. We are now entering an era where both of these limitations are being addressed, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of eccentric binary populations. In this work, we perform the first population inference analysis that simultaneously fits the mass, spin, redshift, and eccentricity distribution. Specifically, we use source-parameter estimation provided by the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) framework using the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, and a default O4a population model extended to include eccentricity. We find population properties broadly consistent with conclusions obtained in previous analyses assuming quasi-circular binaries. Consistent with our conclusions about each event, we bound the branching ratio for eccentric events to be below $0.0239$ at $90\%$ confidence with our fiducial eccentricity mixture models. Using four different parametric population models for eccentricity, we point out that the rate of eccentric events is weakly constrained by observations and highly model-dependent.</description>

      <title>Future Perspectives on Black Hole Jet Mechanisms: Insights from Next-Generation Observatories and Theoretical Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole jets represent one of the most extreme manifestations of astrophysical processes, linking accretion physics, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, and large-scale feedback in galaxies and clusters. Despite decades of observational and theoretical work, the mechanisms governing jet launching, collimation, and energy dissipation remain open questions. In this article, we discuss how upcoming facilities such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST), and the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) will provide unprecedented constraints on jet dynamics, variability, and multi-wavelength signatures. Furthermore, we highlight theoretical challenges, including the role of magnetically arrested disks (MADs), plasma microphysics, and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations in shaping our understanding of jet formation. By combining high-resolution imaging, time-domain surveys, and advanced simulations, the next decade promises transformative progress in unveiling the physics of black hole jets.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal X-ray Emission from Merging Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent hydrodynamical simulations have identified a disappearing thermal X-ray signature in massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) embedded in circumbinary disks, arising from the tidal truncation and depletion of minidiscs shortly before merger. This feature has been proposed as a promising electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers detectable by LISA. In this work, we examine whether non-thermal X-ray emission powered by magnetic reconnection could obscure or modify this thermal X-ray drop. We construct semi-analytic models for both the thermal X-ray emission from minidiscs and the non-thermal synchrotron emission produced by reconnection in magnetically dominated black hole magnetospheres. Evaluating these models across the MBHB mass range relevant for LISA, we find that for physically motivated magnetic field strengths and accretion rates, the non-thermal X-ray luminosity remains several orders of magnitude below the thermal component throughout the inspiral. Even under optimistic assumptions that enhance the non-thermal emission, it remains significantly subdominant. We further incorporate the magnetospheric balding framework to model the decay of non-thermal emission near merger, finding that reconnection-powered X-ray emission fades on short, mass-scaled timescales once the external magnetic flux supply is disrupted. Taken together, our results indicate that non-thermal emission is unlikely to mask the disappearing thermal X-ray signature, reinforcing its robustness as an electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers and its potential utility for multi-messenger studies with LISA.</description>

      <title>Unmasking LHAASO J2108+5157: Near Infrared Insights into a Mysterious TeV Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LHAASO J2108+5157 is one of the few ultra-high energy gamma-ray sources in the LHAASO catalogue without secure counterpart at longer wavelengths. Several Galactic scenarios have been proposed, including an evolved supernova remnant and a pulsar wind nebula. Yet, no shocked gas, shell-like structure, or compact pulsar candidate has been identified. Follow-up observations with VERITAS and the LST-1 prototype have not firmly clarified its nature. A recent microquasar candidate from GMRT radio data remains uncertain. Here we present the first dedicated near-infrared study of the field, combining deep JHKs imaging with narrow band observations targeting the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line. Our observations were initially planned to encompass the full source region, but now only partially cover the latest updated position and size of LHAASO J2108+5157. We find no evidence of shocked emission, extended nebular structures, or an accreting compact object signature in the covered field. The GMRT radio source, despite its jet-like morphology, exhibits near-infrared properties incompatible with both a Galactic microquasar and a nearby radio galaxy, discouraging an association with the gamma-ray emission. Our analysis reveals no convincing counterpart consistent within the positional uncertainty, leaving LHAASO J2108+5157 as an enigmatic ultra-high energy emitter that requires deeper observations.</description>

      <title>Modern tidal interaction models for rapid binary population synthesis: I. Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an updated prescription of contemporary tidal dissipation theory adapted for rapid binary population synthesis. Our simplified expressions encode the dependence of tidal dissipation on stellar structure, stratification, and tidal forcing frequency, while remaining computationally efficient. We implement these prescriptions in the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS, and demonstrate the self-consistent coupling of tides with stellar evolution and binary properties such as orbital periods, spins, and eccentricities for several representative binary systems. When compared with commonly used tidal prescriptions, our equilibrium tidal dissipation efficiencies can be stronger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low mass main sequence and giant type stars, and dynamical tides can be stronger by 1-7 orders of magnitude due to the explicit dependence on internal stellar structure and the presence of inertial wave dissipation. Despite our simplistic approach, our models agree with detailed stellar simulations to within an order of magnitude across tidal dissipation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The stellar-to-halo mass relation of central galaxies across three orders of halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar content of galaxies is tightly connected to the mass and growth of their host dark matter halos. Observational constraints on this relation remain limited, particularly for low-mass groups, leaving uncertainties in how galaxies assemble their stars across halo mass scales. Accurately measuring the brightest central galaxy (BCG) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) over a wide mass range is therefore crucial for understanding galaxy formation and the role of feedback processes. Here we present the SHMR spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}$-$10^{15}\,M_\odot$, using halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry. By stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups, we recover robust average halo gas temperatures for each bin, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T_X$ relation. We find that the SHMR peaks near $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with a declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This trend reflects a combination of processes that reduce the efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos, such as AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and the increasing dominance of ex-situ assembly, while halos continue to grow through mergers and accretion. Our measurements are consistent over the full mass range with previous observational studies, including weak lensing, X-ray analyses of individual clusters, and kinematical and dynamical methods. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal significant discrepancies in the normalization at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history. These results provide the first X-ray-based observational SHMR covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establish a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Unstable Mass Transfer in Interacting Binaries and Its Imprint on the Population of Luminous Red Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common-envelope (CE) phase occurs when a star engulfs its companion and is widely considered the primary channel for producing Luminous Red Novae (LRNe). In this study, we combine binary-population synthesis with stellar-evolution calculations to systematically estimate the mass, velocity, and launching radius of ejecta produced during coalescence across a range of binary configurations. Our aim is to quantify how unstable mass-transfer dynamics in binaries at various evolutionary stages shape CE outcomes, enabling a predictive framework for modeling the LRN luminosity function. We find a bimodal distribution of plateau luminosities with significant implications for binary mass stability criteria that can be tested with forthcoming LSST observations. This bimodality emerges from differing mass-ejection outcomes during common-envelope interactions, which can lead either to stellar mergers, often accompanied by tidal disruption of the companion, or to successful envelope ejection. Although our predicted plateau luminosities and timescales broadly match existing observations, the models underpredict the number of LRNe with long-duration plateaus ($t_p \gtrsim 100\, \text{d}$) by about a third. We propose that these long-duration events arise from highly extended progenitors whose envelopes are ejected over multiple orbits (i.e., non-impulsively), producing relatively faint, long-lived transients. By constraining ejecta properties and incorporating pre-outburst progenitor imaging, we show how our models can clarify the physical processes that drive unstable mass transfer in these events. Finally, we argue that common-envelope interactions involving white-dwarf accretors can yield exotic outcomes, including red giants containing embedded white dwarfs that resemble Thorne-\.{Z}ytk\'ow objects (T\.ZOs), along with calcium-rich supernovae that preserve hydrogen envelopes.</description>

      <title>Evidence that SOL2012-06-03 Late Phase $\gamma$ Rays are Produced by $&gt;$300 MeV Protons from CME-Shock Acceleration of Suprathermals from the Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper on SOL2012-06-03 reported the detection for the first time of two distinct phases of $&gt;$100 MeV $\gamma$-radiation indicating separate acceleration processes. But such two-phase emission has been seen before and was first observed in SOL1982-06-03. The second phase is known as Late Phase Gamma-Ray Emission (LPGRE) and was cataloged for $&gt;$40 solar eruptions, including SOL2012-06-03. Here we provide evidence that the second SOL2012-06-03 $\pi$-decay peak is the onset of LPGRE that lasted for $&gt;$8 min. Its delay from the impulsive X-ray peak is consistent with the time it would take flare-produced suprathermal protons to overtake the expanding CME and be accelerated by its shock. The high accelerated ion-to-electron ratio in SOL2012-06-03 and other LPGRE events is consistent with the ratio observed in gradual SEP events produced by shocks and is inconsistent with ratios typically found in impulsive flares and solar energetic particle events produced by reconnection.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation as the origin of the anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature momentum distributions observed in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature distributed particle momenta are commonly observed in collisionless space plasmas, such as the solar wind. Using Liouville's theorem, we argue that anisotropic compression or expansion of the plasma, followed by a relaxation of the resulting anisotropic stress must lead to non-equilibrium states that are either anisotropic, non-thermal distribution functions, different electron and ion temperatures, or a combination of these effects. We present arguments showing that a plasma in thermal equilibrium undergoing anisotropic compression or expansion cannot return to thermal equilibrium in the absence of particle collisions. Since most astrophysical plasmas are practically collisionless and experience significant anisotropic compression or expansion, we expect anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature particle distributions to be ubiquitous, in agreement with solar wind measurements.</description>

      <title>Crustal lattice pressure as a source of neutron star mountains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin frequencies of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries may be limited by the emission of gravitational waves. A candidate for producing such steady emission is a mass asymmetry, or "mountain", sourced by temperature asymmetries in the star's crust. A number of studies have examined temperature-induced shifts in the crustal capture layers between one nuclear species and another to produce this asymmetry, with the presence of capture layers in the deep crust being needed to produce the required mass asymmetries. However, modern equation of state calculations cast doubt on the existence of such deep capture layers. Motivated by this, we investigated an alternative source of temperature dependence in the equation of state, coming from the pressure supplied by the solid crustal lattice itself. We show that temperature-induced perturbations in this pressure, while small, may be significant. We therefore advocate for more detailed calculations, self-consistently calculating both the temperature asymmetries, the perturbations in crustal lattice pressure, and the consequent mass asymmetries, to establish if this is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed distribution of low-mass X-ray binary spin frequencies. Furthermore, the crustal lattice pressure mechanism does not require accretion, extending the possibility for such thermoelastic mountains to include both accreting and isolated neutron stars.</description>

      <title>A second-scale periodicity in an active repeating fast radio burst source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are fierce radio flashes from the deep sky. Abundant observations have indicated that highly magnetized neutron stars might be involved in these energetic bursts, but the underlying trigger mechanism is still enigmatic. Especially, the widely expected periodicity connected to the spin of the central engine has never been discovered, which leads to further debates on the nature of FRBs. Here we report the first discovery of a $\sim 1.7\,\mathrm{s}$ period in the repeating source of FRB 20201124A. This is an active repeater, from which more than 2800 FRBs have been observed on a total of 49 days. The phase-folding method is adopted to analyze the bursts on each day separately. While no significant periodic signal is found in all other datasets, a clear periodicity does appear on two specific days, i.e. a period of $1.706024(13)\,\mathrm{s}$ on MJD 59310, and a slightly larger period of $1.707968(9)\,\mathrm{s}$ on MJD 59347. A period derivative of $6.11(5)\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{s\,s^{-1}}$ can be derived from these two periods, which further implies a surface magnetic field strength of $1.03\times 10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ and a spin-down age of 44 years for the central engine. A joint analysis on these two days yields a significance of $7.3\sigma$ for the periodicity. It is concluded that FRB 20201124A should be associated with a young magnetar.</description>

Abstract: The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, none of the metric model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of some exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties do not allow us to detect exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>The pulsar wind nebula around B1853+01 in X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations with \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the W44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence of a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, at the southern edge of the W44 thermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing the pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, an ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1\arcmin~($\sim$1.0 pc at a distance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded by a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this structure displays the same unusual morphology as the ``outflow'' feature and extends along $\sim$6\arcmin~($\sim$5 pc) in the direction of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved spectral analysis for different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is carried out. For an updated value of the column density of $0.65_{-0.42}^{+0.46} \times 10^{22} ~\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the ``outflow'' region yields a spectral index $\Gamma \approx 1.24_{-0.24}^{+0.23}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar ($\Gamma \approx 1.87_{-0.43}^{+0.48}$) and the pulsar tail ($\Gamma \approx 2.01_{-0.38}^{+0.39}$). We argue that both the ``outflow'' structure and the surrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles escaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for other bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.</description>

      <title>A semi-coherent search for optical pulsations from Scorpius X-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emission of continuous gravitational waves (CWs) possibly explains why pulsars spinning with a period shorter than a millisecond have not been observed so far. Neutron stars accreting mass at the highest rates are the most promising targets for a search for CWs, because a strong emission of gravitational waves is required to balance the torque exerted by mass accretion onto the neutron star. Detecting coherent pulsations in the electromagnetic emission maximizes the search sensitivity, but has so far not been successful for most of the brightest accreting neutron stars. Here, we present the first search for pulsations in the optical band from the brightest accreting neutron star known, Sco X-1. To this end, we tailored semi-coherent search strategies to data obtained over four years, for a total of $\sim$$56$ ks, by the SiFAP2 fast photometer mounted at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). These searches are especially suited to analysing long observations of systems for which only limited knowledge on the orbital parameters is available, and involve joining coherent analyses on shorter segments without connecting the spin phase between them. The large count rates afforded by an optical telescope and the efficiency of the search strategy employed allowed us to set an upper limit of $9 \times 10^{-5}$ to the pulsed amplitude, which is lower by a factor of four with respect to previous searches in the X-ray band. We also show that the application of semi-coherent searches to SiFAP2 observations of the first detected optical millisecond pulsar, PSR J1023+0038, could have preceded its detection in the radio band. These results highlight the role played by high-time-resolution optical observations in performing deep searches of quickly rotating pulsars.</description>

      <title>A volcanic chronosequence as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to study the cosmic-ray flux in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene</title>

Abstract: We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Cha\^ine des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years. This volcanic region provides a unique chronosequence of samples brought to the surface by well-dated eruptions. By modeling the expected density of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic-ray muons in olivine, we show that the signal is detectable and above backgrounds from natural radioactivity. We demonstrate that by analyzing samples with different exposure ages, it is possible to construct a time-differential measurement of the cosmic-ray flux. This method shows sensitivity to historical variations, such as the enhanced flux expected during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion ($\sim$41~kyr) and the potential contribution from nearby supernovae, for which we use the Antlia supernova remnant precursor as a benchmark. This work establishes a new application of the paleo-detector technique for long-scale time-domain high-energy astrophysics and provides the direct scientific motivation for experimental efforts to measure these track records.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic constraints for 1D planar grey photon diffusion from linear transport with special-relativistic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a grey linear diffusion equation for photons with respect to inertial (or lab-frame) space and time, using asymptotic analysis in 1D planar geometry. The solution of the equation is the comoving radiation energy density. Our analysis does not make use of assumptions about the magnitude of velocity; instead we derive an asymptotic scaling in the lab frame such that we avoid apparent non-physical pathologies that are encountered with the standard static-matter scaling. We permit the photon direction to be continuous (as opposed to constraining the analysis to discrete ordinates). The result is a drift-diffusion equation in the lab frame for comoving radiation energy density, with an adiabatic term that matches the standard semi-relativistic diffusion equation. Following a recent study for discrete directions, this equation reduces to a pure advection equation as the velocity approaches the speed of light. We perform preliminary numerical experiments comparing solutions to relativistic lab-frame Monte Carlo transport and to the well-known semi-relativistic diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the AGN population origin of TeV neutrinos with their spatial correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detection of TeV neutrinos from some nearby Seyfert galaxy (e.g., NGC1068) by IceCube suggests that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could make a significant contribution to diffuse astrophysical neutrinos. The absence of TeV gamma-rays from NGC1068 indicates neutrino production in a compact opaque region of gamma-rays. The vicinity of the supermassive black hole, such as the disk-corona, is an ideal region, where the high radiation density leads to efficient neutrino production and gamma-ray attenuation. Disk-corona models predict that the neutrino emission from AGNs correlates with X-ray emission, which traces the coronal activity. In this paper, we assess whether diffuse TeV neutrinos can originate from X-ray-emitting AGNs with Monte Carlo simulations, considering the predicted performance of future neutrino telescopes. We test this hypothesis by searching for spatial correlations between the X-ray AGN population and high-energy neutrinos, assuming that the neutrino flux scales with the AGN X-ray flux. Based on detailed Monte Carlo simulations, we find that an AGN origin of diffuse neutrinos can be tested at a significance of about $3\sigma$ with five years of IceCube-Gen2 observations. With improved angular resolution and sensitivity, a 30km$^{3}$-scale underwater neutrino telescope (such as the High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope) is expected to reach a significance of about $8\sigma$ with one year of exposure. The detection significance decreases if AGNs contribute partially to the total astrophysical neutrino flux. Our results highlight the critical role of angular resolution in diagnosing the AGN origin of diffuse TeV neutrinos.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic-ray Knee as a Local Signature of Nearby PeVatrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum, characterized by a sudden steepening of the spectral shape at $\sim 4$ PeV, may be interpreted either as a global feature of Galactic cosmic rays or as a local signature. In the former scenario, cosmic-ray spectra throughout the Galaxy would be similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood, and the knee would be a common feature of the cosmic-ray sea. In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole signatures from femtolensing and spectral fringe of Gamma Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtolensing of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are vastly studied to constrain the primordial black hole (PBHs) lighter than $10^{-13}$ solar mass and may close the window for PBH dark matter. In this case, wave optics formalism is required and carefully implemented in our analysis. Incorporating the GRB observational data from Swift XRT, we perform the statistic analysis of PBH lensing, comparing with null hypothesis where BAND model is used to parametrize the GRB spectrum. We found few GRB data manifest the spectral fringe which characterize the feature of femtolensing by PBHs, and the analysis shows moderate statistical preference in terms of goodness of fit. Conversely, since most of the fitting to GRB spectral data do not improved with PBH lensing, we utilize to obtain upper bound on the PBH fractional abundance with respect to dark matter. However, the robust constraint cannot be achieved, unless the size of GRBs are smaller than $5\times10^{7}$ m for PBH mass around $5\times10^{-15}$ solar mass.</description>

      <title>A Faint Progenitor System for the Faint Supernova 2024vjm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are well known for their role as standardizable cosmological candles. Their uniformity is credited to their single origin as thermonuclear explosions of White dwarf (WD) stars. Nevertheless, some SNe Ia break this regularity. Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gravitational Waves from Supersoft X-ray Sources: Promising Targets for deci-Hz Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) host white dwarfs (WDs) accreting at rates that sustain steady nuclear burning, driving rapid mass growth, radial contraction, and magnetic field amplification. Angular-momentum transfer from the accretion disk naturally spins up the WD, while the amplified internal magnetic field induces a non-axisymmetric deformation in presence of a misaligned rotation. Such WDs emits continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We model the coupled evolutions of stellar mass, spin, and magnetic structure in accreting WDs in SSSs with MESA, and compute the resulting quadrupolar deformation with the Einstein-Maxwell solver XNS. We show that WDs in SSSs, particularly near the end of thermal timescale mass transfer and close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, produce CGWs predominantly in the deci-Hz band accessible to planned detectors such as DECIGO, BBO, Deci-Hz, ALIA, and LGWA, and are distinguishable from other Galactic CGW sources such as AM CVn systems, detached double WDs, and isolated WDs. Well studied SSSs such as CAL 83 and RX J0019+2156 can be detectable, enabling targeted CGW measurements that directly probe WD's internal magnetic fields and rotation, while blind searches can reveal hundreds of obscured SSSs otherwise missed in soft X-rays and map the hidden population of accreting, rapidly rotating, magnetized WDs in nearby galaxies. A CGW detection from WDs in SSSs could also identify potential pre-explosion Type Ia progenitors.</description>

      <title>Kilohertz Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Full Spectrum Analyses and High-density Constraints on Neutron Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate Bayesian analyses of the complete gravitational-wave spectrum of binary neutron star mergers events with the next-generation detector Einstein Telescope. Our mock analyses are performed for 20 different signals using the TEOBResumSPA_NRPMw waveform that models gravitational-waves from the inspiral to the postmerger phase. They are employed to validate a pipeline for neutron star's extreme matter constraints with prospective detections and under minimal hypotheses on the equation of state. The proposed analysis stack delivers inferences for the mass-radius curve, the mass dependence of the quadrupolar tidal polarizability parameter, the neutron star's maximum density, the maximum mass and the relative radius, and the pressure-density relation itself. We show that a single event at a signal-to-noise ratio close to the minimum threshold for postmerger detection is sufficient to tightly constrain all the above relations as well as quantities like the maximum mass (maximum density) to precision of ${\sim}6$% (${\sim}10$%) at 90% credibility level. We also revisit inferences of prompt black hole formation with full spectrum signals and find that the latter can be robustly identified, even when the postmerger is not detectable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. New results on the impact of the initial signal frequency and of the detector configuration (triangular vs. two-L) on the source's parameters estimation are also reported. An improvement of approximately one order of magnitude in the precision of the chirp mass and mass ratio can be achieved by lowering the initial frequency from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The two-L configuration shows instead significant improvements on the inference of the source declination, due to geographical separation of the two detectors.</description>

      <title>Geodesics and Shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate geodesics and black hole shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. We show that the equations of motion for null geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined relative to the magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Lepton number crossings are insufficient for flavor instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, the mean field of flavor coherence can develop instabilities. A necessary condition is that the flavor lepton number changes sign as a function of energy and/or angle. Whether such a crossing is also sufficient has been a longstanding question. We construct an explicit counterexample: a spectral crossing without accompanying flavor instability, with an even number of crossings being key. This failure is physically understood as Cherenkov-like emission of flavor waves. If flipped-lepton-number neutrinos never dominate among those kinematically allowed to decay, the waves cannot grow.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hills mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a framework based on kinematics to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 91 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>An Implementation to Identify the Properties of Multiple Population of Gravitational Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability.
  In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers.
  To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4).
  We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.</description>
