      <title>Double-trace instability of BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the linear stability of rotating BTZ black holes under massive scalar field perturbations with double-trace boundary conditions. While BTZ black holes are stable under standard Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we demonstrate that they can develop instabilities when subjected to double-trace boundary conditions. Our key findings are threefold. First, we show that BTZ black holes exhibit instabilities not only for non-axisymmetric modes $\unicode{x2013}$ previously the only known unstable sector $\unicode{x2013}$ but crucially also for axisymmetric modes. Second, we prove that the axisymmetric instability is the dominant and most fundamental: configurations unstable to any non-axisymmetric mode are already unstable to the axisymmetric one. Third, we identify regions in the BTZ parameter space where these black holes are unstable while global AdS$_3$ remains stable, and we map the complete onset curves that determine the corresponding stability boundaries. Unlike conventional superradiant instabilities, the BTZ double-trace instability occurs for angular velocities always satisfying the Hawking-Reall bound. We trace the physical origin of these instabilities to the influx of energy and angular momentum through the asymptotic boundary permitted by double-trace deformations for a particular sign of the coupling, rather than to near-horizon effects. Our results provide a prototype for understanding double-trace instabilities in higher-dimensional rotating AdS black holes and suggest the existence of rotating hairy black hole solutions with scalar condensates, which we construct in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>A novel violation of the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that any discrepancy between an object's inertial and gravitational masses, leading to a violation of the equivalence principle, arises from the nature of its internal constituents and their interactions. We show here that the difference can instead be a function of the distance of the object from a gravitating body, and suggest ways of testing this, illustrating side-by-side a covariant framework for the same.</description>

      <title>Deviations from Gaussian White Noise in Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation is widely used as a framework to study scalar field perturbations on an inflationary spacetime in a classical manner. In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>A Search for Binary Black Hole Mergers in LIGO O1-O3 Data with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by LIGO from the binary black hole merger GW150914, gravitational wave astronomy has developed significantly, with over 200 compact binary merger events cataloged. The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of thick branes in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the quasinormal modes of thick branes in $f(R)$ gravity by numerically solving the Schr\"odinger-like perturbation equation of gravitational perturbations. To ensure the reliability of the results, we employ three complementary methods: the asymptotic iteration method, the direct integration of the wave equation, and the time-domain numerical evolution. We analyze how the model parameters influence the shape of the effective potential of gravitational perturbations and find that the structure of the potential barrier plays a significant role in shaping the quasinormal frequency spectrum. The results obtained from the three methods exhibit strong consistency, thereby ensuring the reliability of the calculations. In particular, the real parts of the quasinormal frequencies exhibit an approximately arithmetic progression, suggesting that the quasi-localized states can be understood as resonances between the barriers.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Lyapunov exponents, phase transitions and chaos bound in nonlinear electrodynamics black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents of chaos for both massless and charged particles around a non-linear electrodynamics black hole, and explore their relationships with a phase transition and a chaos bound of this black hole. Our results indicate that these exponents can effectively reveal the phase transition. Specifically, during the phase transition, the violation of the chaos bound occurs solely within a stable branch of a small black hole. Moreover, regardless of whether the phase transition takes place, the violations are observed.</description>

      <title>Between two descriptions of dark matter around a black hole: photon sphere, shadow, and lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine observational discrepancies of two widely used models describing anisotropic (dark) matter distributions around a black hole, focusing on their photon spheres, shadow radii, and lensing observables. The models considered are the vacuum and Einstein cluster dark matter model, characterized by negative and zero radial pressure, respectively. The analysis reveals that these models display contrasting photon sphere behavior. In particular, the Einstein cluster results in a more pronounced deviation in the shadow radius relative to the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Additionally, a distinctive lensing phenomenon associated with the matter halo is identified in both models.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo approach to stationary kinetic disks in the Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recently proposed Monte Carlo scheme for computing stationary solutions of the general-relativistic Vlasov equation to the Kerr spacetime. As an example, we focus on razor-thin configurations of a gas confined to the equatorial plane and extending to spatial infinity. We consider monoenergetic models as well as solutions corresponding to planar Maxwell-J\"{u}ttner distributions at infinity. In both cases, the components of the particle current surface density are recovered within the proposed Monte Carlo framework. Some aspects of razor-thin kinetic disk models, including an analysis of the bulk angular momentum and angular velocity, are briefly covered.</description>

      <title>Ghost-free 2-form fields in cosmology: implications for gravitational parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of parity-violating, nonminimally coupled 2-form field theories that retain the same dynamical degrees of freedom as a massive 2-form and thus are ghost-free. Starting from the most general kinetic terms and dimension four couplings between the 2-form field and the curvature tensors, we find a two-parameter family of such theories. However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical. We show that chiral gravitational waves can be generated in the presence of parity-violating terms in the potential.</description>

      <title>Origin of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations and Accretion Process in X-Ray Binaries around Quantum Lee-Wick Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the accretion dynamics and test particle motion around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric Lee-Wick black hole (BH) to reveal how the model parameters affect orbital stability and the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binary systems. The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: The Kerr-Schild gauge is generalized to the case that the vector generating the deformation is not null. Contrary to naive expectations, this vector generates a finite expansion for the curvature tensor. We prove a theorem
  on the conditions for the deformed metric being Ricci flat, namely that the deformation vector must be geodesic of the background spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of gravitational collapse in the context of scalar-tensor theories of Gravity. We introduce a new hydrodynamical formulation in the Einstein frame, inspired by that of Misner and Sharp. We obtain the equilibrium Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff condition that we use to find valid initial states of the problem within this framework. For illustration purposes, we present the minimal version of the initial phases of the collapse together with an analysis of the corresponding junction conditions.</description>

      <title>Advantages and disadvantages of maximally entangled states in dilaton black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.</description>

      <title>GW231123: Overlapping Gravitational Wave Signals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered gravitational wave event GW231123 was interpreted as the merger of two black holes with a total mass of 190-265 $M_\odot$, making it the heaviest such merger detected to date. Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, equivalence principle, and HBAR entropy, in a new bumblebee black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum information and thermodynamic properties of a new bumblebee black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking by analyzing near-horizon physics through complementary quantum probes. We study the degradation of quantum entanglement for field modes shared by inertial and accelerated observers in spacelike and lightlike Lorentz-violating vacua that generate identical spacetime metrics. Using the near-horizon Rindler correspondence, we derive analytic expressions for the logarithmic negativity and mutual information and examine their dependence on detector position, frequency, and Lorentz-violation parameters. Despite sharing the same metric, the two Lorentz-violating vacua become distinguishable near the horizon, particularly at low frequencies. We analyze the excitation of a freely falling two-level atom coupled to quantum fields near the horizon. The associated acceleration-radiation transition probabilities are computed explicitly. The resulting atomic response is locally indistinguishable from that in flat spacetime, confirming the validity of the equivalence principle even in the presence of Lorentz-violating corrections. Finally, we extend the notion of horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy to the bumblebee black hole and derive the corresponding entropy production rate induced by infalling atoms.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating Black Holes in DHOST Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study slowly rotating black hole solutions within Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories. Starting from a static, spherically symmetric metric solution of a DHOST theory, we employ the Hartle-Thorne ansatz to model a slowly rotating spacetime. We show that the differential equation governing the frame-dragging function $\omega$ (which is supposed to depend on the radial coordinate only) is integrable for any DHOST theory allowing us to obtain its explicit form. We also consider angular dependence in $\omega$ and show that regularity at the horizon and at infinity forbids it, as in General Relativity. As an illustration of the formalism introduced here, we study the slowly-rotating version of black hole solutions with primary hair obtained recently, examining the influence of the rotation on the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and on the circular light trajectories in the equatorial plane.</description>

      <title>Revisiting particle circular orbits as probes of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, jumps in the particle circular-orbit radius $r_{\rm c}$ have been proposed as observational signatures of black hole phase transitions, supported by the general consensus that $r_{\rm c}$ increases monotonically with the horizon radius $r_h$. However, in this paper, we will show that this monotonicity is not universally valid. By deriving a universal, ensemble-independent criterion for $\mathrm{d}r_{\rm c}/\mathrm{d}r_h$ and applying it to the $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter black hole, we reveal a sharp dichotomy: while $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ exhibits strictly monotonicity along isobars, it typically becomes non-monotonic along isotherms (except for the photon sphere of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole)--a behavior that has been overlooked in previous studies. Nevertheless, we rigorously prove that within the phase-transition region itself, the monotonicity of $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ is preserved. However, the generalizability of this result to other spacetimes requires case-by-case verification, and its validity could have notable implications for the observability of the jump in $r_{\rm c}$. Interestingly, non-monotonicity itself acts as a new observational probe: the monotonicity contrast in $r_{\rm c}(r_h)$ distinguishes isobaric from isothermal evolution, providing a complementary thermodynamic probe. Furthermore, we show that the critical exponents extracted from $r_{\rm c}$ match those obtained from $r_h$, independent of ensemble. Remarkably, all these phenomena are closely tied to the thermodynamic first law.</description>

      <title>Networks as the fundamental constituents of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review an approach that uses binary relations as the fundamental constituents of the universe, utilizing them as building blocks for both space and matter. The model is defined by an ultraviolet continuous fixed point of a statistical model on random networks, governed by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature, which acts as a network analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert action. The model exhibits two distinct phases separated by this fixed point, a geometric and a random phase, representing space and matter, respectively. At weak coupling and on large scales, the network organizes into a holographic surface whose collective state encodes both an emergent 3D space and the matter distributed in it. The Einstein equations emerge as constitutive relations expressing matter in terms of fundamental network degrees of freedom while dynamics in a comoving frame is governed by relativistic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however is an effective theory breaking down at the scale of the radius of curvature of the holographic network. On smaller scales, not only relativistic invariance is lost but also the Lorentzian signature of space-time. Finally, the manifold nature of space-time breaks down on the Planck length, where the random character of the fundamental network on the smallest scales becomes apparent. The network model seems to naturally encode several of the large-distance features of cosmology, albeit still at a qualitative level. The holographic property of black holes arises intrinsically from the expander nature of random regular graphs. There is a natural mechanism to resolve the cosmological constant problem and dark matter appears naturally as a metastable allotrope in the network fabric of space-time. In this model, both gravity and quantum mechanics are macroscopic statistical effects reflecting the free energy minimization of fundamental binary degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of rotating black holes beyond general relativity in the WKB approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring gravitational theories beyond general relativity (GR) with black hole (BH) spectroscopy requires accurate and flexible methods for computing their quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum. A popular method of choice is the higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, mostly applied to nonrotating BHs. While previous studies demonstrated that the higher-order WKB method can also be used for Kerr BHs in GR, there has been little work on rotating BHs in modified theories of gravity. In this work, we revive the idea by extending WKB calculations of the Kerr QNM spectrum to higher order and assessing its accuracy against continued-fraction tabulated data. We then apply the WKB approximation beyond GR, comparing it against both linearized and continued fraction calculations in the parametrized beyond-Teukolsky formalism and in higher-derivative gravity (HDG) theories. We find that the frequencies computed by the WKB method in theories beyond GR have better accuracy than the measurement errors for GW250114, the event with the highest ringdown signal-to-noise ratio observed to date.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the Quantum Stress Tensor Fluctuations and the Limits of Semiclassical Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and its fluctuations in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$. A necessary condition for the conceptual consistency of semiclassical gravity, where $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$ represent the sources of the Einstein equations, is that the fluctuations of the energy momentum tensor remain small compared to its expectation value. We study the renormalization of both the energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x)\rangle_{\rm ren}$ and the fluctuation tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x) T_{cd}(x) \rangle_{\rm ren}$ for suitable Hadamard states, using the operator product expansion for a free scalar field on a fixed curved background. We show that squeezed vacua -- arising naturally in black hole evaporation and in inflationary cosmology -- fail to satisfy the semiclassicality criterion.</description>

      <title>Revisited apparent horizon entropy and GSL in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a universal and revisited formalism for the entropy of the apparent horizon in modified gravity to investigate the validity of the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics. This revisited horizon entropy is constructed directly from the modified Friedmann equations in a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The resulting entropy relation contains, beside the standard Bekenstein-Hawking term, an additional integral contribution that encodes the effective energy density and pressure generated by deviations from general relativity. Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift. The analysis demonstrates that including the integral term in the revisited entropy can relatively improve the late-time validity of the GSL for some of these models while living others unchanged, thereby reinforcing the profound connection between thermodynamics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Trails of clouds in binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes can give rise to long-lived bosonic clouds, offering natural laboratories to probe ultralight particles across a wide range of parameter space. The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of ``co-rotating'' floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that ``counter-rotating'' orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein~Telescope.</description>

      <title>A Re-Examination Of Foundational Elements Of Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper undertakes a conceptual re-examination of several foundational elements of cosmology through the lens of spacetime symmetries. A new derivation of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric is obtained by a careful conceptual examination of rotations and translations on generic manifolds, followed by solving the rotational and translational Killing equations, yielding both the metric \emph{and} its translational generators for $k\in\{-1,0,1\}$ without any further assumptions. We then analyze how continuous symmetries are inherited by the Einstein tensor and the Hilbert energy-momentum tensor, proving two general propositions. Furthermore, we use the Maxwell and Kalb-Ramond fields to show that a homogeneous and isotropic energy-momentum tensor, in general, does \emph{not} give rise to field configurations which share these symmetries. In particular, the Kalb-Ramond field we derive is significantly more general than what is usually encountered in the cosmological context. Finally, we provide a rigorous but accessible, elementary, and transparent derivation of the scalar-vector-tensor decomposition from the linearized Einstein equations. Together, these results highlight the value of multiple complementary formulations of the same cosmological physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (GPPE) that is used to model self-gravitating superfluid systems, which include gravitationally collapsed boson and axion stars and dark-matter haloes. We outline how this framework can be used to develop minimal models for neutron stars and for pulsars and their glitches. We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Some examples of use of transfinite induction in analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is not uncommon in analysis that existence of extremal objects is obtained via an iterative procedure: we start from a given admissible object, then modify it, then modify again etc... If being extremal means maximimizing a real valued quantity and we are sure to approach the supremum fast enough, after a countable number of steps and a limiting procedure we are done.
  In this short note we want to advertise a slightly different line of thought, where rather than trying to approach the supremum fast enough, we: try to increase, if possible, the function to be maximized and, at the same time, index our recursive procedure over ordinals. Since there are no increasing functions from $\omega_1$ to $\R$, the procedure must stop at some countable ordinal and existence is proved anyway.
  The advantage of this line of reasoning is that it can be helpful even in situations where it is not so evident how to measure `being maximal' via a real valued function. This is the case, for instance, for existence of a Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development of an initial data set in General Relativity.
  Speaking of this particular example, we also show that such `real-valued quantification' of the size of a development is actually possible, thus existence of a maximal one can be obtained in a countable number of steps using the original argument in [2] together with the standard procedure depicted above. This provides a way alternative to the one given in [5] to `dezornify' the proof in [2].</description>

      <title>Creation of spin-3/2 dark matter via cosmological gravitational particle production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) of spin-3/2 particles during and after cosmic inflation, and map the parameter space that can realize the observed dark matter density in stable spin-3/2 particles. Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Shape of Kerr Black Holes at the Photon Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bright ring-like structures observed in the images of M87* and SgrA* captured by the Event Horizon Telescope strongly support the validity of general relativity. Lensed images of the emission region, often referred to as photon rings in this context, are a direct consequence of the unstable dynamics of null geodesics near the spherical photon orbit in the Kerr spacetime. The order of the lensed image can be characterized by the number of half-orbits the photons complete before reaching the observer, with higher-order photon rings produced by null geodesics that circle the black hole more times. However, low-order rings are significantly influenced by the astrophysical environment. Measuring the Lyapunov exponent requires probing the exponentially small differences between successive photon rings or between photon rings and the shadow. We investigate potential astrophysical sources of systematic error the estimation of Lyapunov exponent, including the location of the observed emission, and especially at low photon ring order. We show that it is nevertheless possible to measure this purely gravitational quantity to roughly 10% and 1% systematic uncertainty by resolving the n=2 and n=3 photon rings with the shadow size, respectively. Therefore, the forthcoming black hole imaging efforts to capture, even if indirectly, the n=2 photon ring can result in a measurement of the Lyapunov exponent that is not limited by astrophysical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave oscillations in Multi-Proca dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave oscillations arise from the exchange of energy between the metric perturbations and additional tensor modes. This phenomenon can occur even when the extra degrees of freedom consist of a triplet of massive Abelian vector fields, as in Multi-Proca dark energy models. In this work, we study gravitational wave oscillations in this class of models minimally coupled to gravity with a general potential, allowing also for a kinetic coupling between the vector field and dark matter that can, in principle, enhance the modulation of gravitational wave amplitudes. After consistently solving the background dynamics, requiring the model parameters to reproduce a phase of late-time accelerated expansion, we assess the accuracy of commonly used analytical approximations and quantify the impact of gravitational wave amplitude modulation for current detectors (LIGO--Virgo) and future missions such as LISA. Although oscillations are present in these scenarios, we find that the effective mass scale (the mixing mass) governing the phenomenon is $m_g \sim \mu_A$, where $\mu_A$ is the (time-dependent) effective mass of the vector dark-energy field. Detectability of gravitational wave oscillations, however, requires $m_g \gg H_0$, which is in tension with the ultra-light masses typically needed to drive accelerated expansion $\mu_A \sim H_0 \sim 10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, if gravitational wave oscillations were to be detected at the corresponding frequencies, they could not be attributed to these classes of dark-energy models.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background with an X-ray Pulsar Timing Array from NICER observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present constraints on the nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB) using X-ray pulsar timing data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer(\textit{NICER}). By analyzing six millisecond pulsars over a six-year observational baseline, we employed a Bayesian framework to model noise components and search for a common red signal consistent with a GWB from supermassive black hole binaries (assuming a spectral index $\gamma_{\rm gwb}=13/3$). Our results show no significant evidence for a GWB, yielding a 95\% upper limit of $\log_{10}(A_{\rm gwb})&lt;-13.4$. Weak evidence for Hellings-Downs spatial correlations was found (S=2.5), though the signal remains statistically inconclusive. Compared to radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsar timing arrays, the \textit{NICER} constraint is currently less stringent but demonstrates the feasibility of X-ray timing with \textit{NICER} for GWB studies and highlights the potential for improved sensitivity with future X-ray missions.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the population of compact binary mergers and their formation pathways with gravitational waves through the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.</description>

Abstract: High-quality test mass substrates play essential roles in laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Inhomogeneous birefringence distribution in test mass substrates, however, can degrade the sensitivity of the detector by introducing the optical loss and disturbing the interferometer controls. In this paper, we present a heterodyne polarimetry method that enables in situ birefringence characterizations, hence diagnosing the gravitational wave interferometer. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed method with a tabletop setup. We also discuss its applicability to current and future gravitational wave detectors and the detectable limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum state of interacting primordial inhomogeneities: de-squeezing and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how interactions affect the quantum state of scalar perturbations during inflation and the quantum correlations they may exhibit. Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Across the Universe: GW231123 as a magnified and diffracted black hole merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 appears as the most massive binary black hole (BBH) ever observed by the LIGO interferometers with total mass $190-265 M_\odot$. A high observed mass can be explained by the combination of cosmological redshift and gravitational magnification if the source is aligned with a gravitational lens, such as a galaxy. Small-scale objects such as stars and remnants diffract the signal, distorting the wavefront and providing additional lensing signatures. Here we present an analysis of GW231123 combining for the first time the effects of diffraction by a small-scale lens and gravitational magnification by an external potential, modelled as an embedded point-mass lens (PL), finding an intriguing case for the lensing hypothesis. Lensing is favoured by the data, with a false alarm probability of the observed Bayes factors bounded below $&lt;1\%$, or $\sim 2.6 \sigma$ confidence level. Including lensing lowers the total source mass of GW231123 to $100-180 M_\odot$, closer to BBHs reported so far, and also removes discrepancies between different waveform approximants and the need for high component spins. We reconstruct all source and lens properties, including the microlens mass $190-850 M_\odot$, its offset, the magnitude of the external gravitational potential and its orientation. The embedded PL analysis leads to a lighter microlens compared to the isolated PL. Within our assumptions, the reconstruction is complete up to an ambiguity between the distance and projected density (mass-sheet degeneracy). Assuming a single galaxy as the macroscopic lens allows us to infer the total amplification of the signal, placing the event at redshift $0.7-2$, and predict the probability $~55\%$ of forming an additional detectable image due to strong lensing by the macrolens. We discuss the implications of our findings on the source and nature of the microlens, including a possible dark matter origin.</description>

      <title>Momentum correlations of the Hawking effect in a quantum fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking effect -- the spontaneous emission of correlated quanta from horizons -- can be observed in laboratory systems where an acoustic horizon forms when a fluid transitions from subcritical to supercritical flow. Although most theoretical and experimental studies have relied on real-space observables, the frequency-dependent nature of the Hawking process motivates a momentum-space analysis to access its spectral structure and entanglement features. Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems. We consider a polaritonic fluid of light in a realistic configuration known to yield strong real-space correlations between Hawking, partner, and witness modes. We find signatures that are directly accessible in state-of-the-art experiments and offer a robust diagnostic of spontaneous emission. Our results form the basis for a new theoretical framework to assess a variety of effects, such as quasi-normal mode emission or modifications of the horizon structure on the Hawking spectrum.</description>

Abstract: The Hamiltonian analysis for a 3-dimensional connection dynamics of $\frak{so}(1,2)$, spanned by $\{L_{-+},L_{-2},L_{+2}\}$ instead of $\{L_{01}, L_{02}, L_{12}\}$, is first conducted in a Bondi-like coordinate system. The symmetry of the system is clearly presented. A null coframe with 3 independent variables and 9 connection coefficients are treated as basic configuration variables. All constraints and their consistency conditions, the solutions of Lagrange multipliers as well as the equations of motion are presented. There is no physical degree of freedom in the system. The Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime is discussed as an example to check the analysis. Unlike the ADM formalism, where only non-degenerate geometries on slices are dealt with and the Ashtekar formalism, where non-degenerate geometries on slices are mainly concerned though the degenerate geometries may be studied as well, in the present formalism the geometries on the slices are always degenerate though the geometries for the spacetime are not degenerate.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases in parameter estimation on LISA binaries: The effect of excluding higher harmonics for non-spinning binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity achieved by the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will allow us to observe gravitational-wave signals from the mergers of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the hundreds, or even thousands. At such high SNR, our ability to precisely infer the parameters of an MBHB from the detected signal will be limited by the accuracy of the waveform templates we use. In this paper, we explore the systematic biases that arise in parameter estimation if we use waveform templates that do not model radiation in higher-order multipoles. This is an important consideration for the large fraction of high-mass events expected to be observed with LISA. We examine how the biases change for MBHB events with different total masses, mass ratios, and inclination angles. We find that systematic biases due to insufficient mode content are severe for events with total redshifted mass $\gtrsim10^6\,M_\odot$. We then compare several methods of predicting such systematic biases without performing a full Bayesian parameter estimation. In particular, we show that through direct likelihood optimization it is possible to predict systematic biases with remarkable computational efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we devise a method to construct approximate waveforms including angular multipoles with $\ell\geq5$ to better understand how many additional modes (beyond the ones available in current approximants) might be required to perform unbiased parameter estimation on the MBHB signals detected by LISA.</description>

Abstract: In the context of Palatini gravity, $F(R+X)$ models, with X the inflaton kinetic term, are characterized by the appealing property of generating asymptotically flat inflaton potentials, exactly like the more commonly studied Palatini $F(R)$ models, but without the complication of non-canonical inflaton kinetic terms in the Einstein frame. In this paper, we study the case of a Jordan frame potential which is positive and bounded, specifically, natural inflation. We compute the CMB observables and show that for a wide class of $F(R + X)$ theories, including the quadratic one, natural inflation is still viable.</description>

      <title>Towards model-independent identification of lensed gravitational waves using Kramers-Kronig relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of microlensed gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are essential for studying the mass density distribution in the universe, including black holes and dark matter halos. However, no confident detection of microlensed GWs have been reported to date. There are two important challenges in the identification of microlensed GWs. The first is that the source waveform and lens structure models are not known a-priori. The second is that certain classes of unlensed GWs could mimic microlensed GWs, resulting in undesirable false alarms. In this work, we propose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems. We argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying causality, where KK relation must hold. The power of this method lies in the fact that microlensed GWs, regardless of the lens structure, must obey KK relation, while unlensed GW events are not in general expected to obey it. This, in principle, allows us to identify microlensed GWs while dismissing microlensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a methodology that exploits KK relation, and test its usefulness under idealized conditions.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Einstein--Maxwell--phantom spacetime: Instabilities of charged Ellis--Bronnikov wormholes and quasinormal modes of black holes</title>

Abstract: Phantom scalar fields, as a viable candidate for dark energy, have been instrumental in eliminating spacetime singularities and constructing wormholes and regular black holes. We investigate the Einstein-Maxwell-phantom (EMP) framework, in which the Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes can be charged and regular black holes can be admitted. While the previous study has shown the stability of EMP wormholes under massless scalar field perturbations, we further perform a comprehensive linear analysis of the EMP spacetime through gravito-electromagnetic field perturbations in the axial sector and phantom scalar field perturbations under an approximate treatment in the polar sector. Our analyses of effective potentials and finite difference time profiles reveal the linear instability of EMP wormholes. In the black hole scenario, the quasinormal spectra of Type I black holes, where the matrix-valued direct integration method and the Prony method are used, recover those of general relativity (GR) when the scalar charge goes to zero. Finally, by introducing the concepts of generalized specific charge and mixing angle, we quantify how the relative contributions between the phantom scalar and the electromagnetic fields modify the quasinormal spectra, and we assess the prospects for detecting spectral deviations between the EMP theory and GR in gravitational wave observation.</description>

Abstract: The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes. We study the formation of the primordial black holes in $k$-essence inflation models with a potential characterized by an inflection point. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. Using the critical collapse and peaks formalism, we calculate the abundance of primordial black holes today.</description>

      <title>Toward relativistic inspirals into black holes surrounded by matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals, compact objects spiraling into massive black holes, represent key sources for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA. The inspirals will occur within rich astrophysical environments containing gravitating matter. Motivated by this, we develop a fully relativistic framework for inspirals under the gravitational influence of matter environments. Our approach employs a two-parameter perturbation expansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter. This yields a modified Teukolsky equation capturing the leading cross-order. We then implement a simple pole-dipole approximation of an axisymmetric environment through a thin matter shell and restrict to non-rotating black holes. As a result, we obtain a piecewise type D spacetime. This enables the use of Teukolsky-based methods while accounting for junction physics. The presence of the matter shell leads to effectively non-separable boundary conditions for the Teukolsky scalar and introduces mode mixing between adjacent multipoles. Additionally, the shell oscillates under the wave perturbation of the inspiral, contributing to the overall flux. The framework provides novel insights into the global dynamics of gravitational radiation in tidal environments. Furthermore, it represents a complete theoretical foundation for a future computation of inspirals and waveforms in our environmental model.</description>

      <title>Squeezed gravitons from superradiant axion fields around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion history and content of the Universe between the end of inflation and the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by matter isocurvature fluctuations in a generic perfect fluid background as a novel probe of the physics of the very early Universe. We analytically compute the induced GW kernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked isocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal is sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid dominating the early Universe after inflation. We find that the GW amplitude is enhanced for a soft equation of state. Our framework can be applied to dark matter isocurvature and models leading to early matter-dominated eras, such as primordial black holes and cosmological solitons.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness for the Bartnik Stationary Extension Problem near Schwarzschild Spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Bartnik stationary extension conjecture, which arises from the definition of the spacetime Bartnik mass for a compact region in a general initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. This conjecture posits the existence and uniqueness (up to isometry) of an asymptotically flat stationary vacuum spacetime containing an initial data set $(M, \mathfrak{g}, \Pi)$ that realizes prescribed Bartnik boundary data on $\partial M$, consisting of the induced metric, mean curvature, and appropriate components of the spacetime extrinsic curvature $\Pi$.
  Building on the analytic framework developed in arXiv:2411.02801 for the static case, we show that, in a double geodesic gauge, the stationary vacuum Einstein equations reduce to a coupled system comprising elliptic and transport-type equations, with the genuinely stationary contributions encoded in an additional boundary value problem for a $1$-form $\theta$.
  We establish local well-posedness for the Bartnik stationary metric extension problem for Bartnik data sufficiently close to that of any coordinate sphere in any initial data set (possibly non time-symmetric) in Schwarzschild spacetime. This includes spheres arbitrary close to the apparent horizon in the initial data set. A key feature of our framework is that the linearized equations decouple: the equations for the metric and potential reduce to the previously solved static case, while the boundary value problem for $\theta$ is treated independently. We prove solvability of this boundary value problem in the Bochner-measurable function spaces adapted to the coupled system developed in arXiv:2411.02801, establishing uniform estimates for the vector spherical harmonic decomposition of $\theta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a class of regular black holes from the proper-time renormalization group approach to asymptotically safe gravity. A central challenge is the robustness of physical predictions to the regularization scheme. We address this by computing key observables for our quantum-corrected black holes, which are non-singular and asymptotically Schwarzschild. We calculate the quasinormal mode spectrum, finding significant deviations from the classical case. The Hawking radiation spectrum is strongly suppressed, implying a slower evaporation rate and relaxed constraints on primordial black holes as dark matter. Shadows and ISCO radii remain consistent with observations. Our results demonstrate that the singularity resolution and its primary observational implications are robust physical outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics of non-minimally coupled matter models using the Brown's variational approach to relativistic fluids in General Relativity. After decomposing the Ricci scalar into a bulk and a boundary term, we construct new models by coupling the bulk term to the fluid variables and an external scalar field. Using dynamical systems techniques, we study models of this type and find that they can give rise to both early-time inflationary behaviour and late-time accelerated expansion. Moreover, these models also contain very interesting features that are rarely seen in this context. For example, we find dark energy models which exhibit phantom crossing in the recent past. Other possibilities include models that give a viable past evolution but terminate in a matter-dominated universe. The dynamical systems themselves display an array of mathematically interesting phenomena, including spirals, centres, and non-trivial bifurcations depending on the chosen parameter values.</description>

The vacuum equations admit inflationary solutions, hinting at an entropic origin for inflation. Equations also admit a regime of phantom like behavior. Assuming that the relation between slow roll parameters and CMB observables holds for entropic gravity, the theory predicts a viable spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational models with non-minimal couplings involving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor have become increasingly popular. The idea of coupling the trace of the matter tensor to the geometry can be applied to various matter models, including relativistic perfect fluids. However, it is well-known that the variational formulation of perfect fluids involves some technicalities. We carefully derive the field equations including the trace coupling of a perfect fluid using two different approaches, namely, that given by Brown using Lagrange multipliers, and that given by Schutz using velocity potentials. We show that previous results involving such trace couplings do not match the results presented here. We demonstrate that our fluid's equations of motion are consistent with the gravitational field equations. Moreover, we present a simple on-shell argument which further supports the correctness of our results.
  Our work implies that a vast amount of the $f(R,T)$ literature using perfect fluids needs to be revisited.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the mass of magnetized relativistic compact star is larger than that of non-magnetized one for the same equation of state and central density, albeit the excess of mass is sizable only if the magnetic fields are strong enough B~10^17-10^18G. Using our recently developed numerical code COCAL, we systematically compute such compact star solutions in equilibrium associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, and show the magnetically supramassive solutions whose masses exceed by more than 10% of the maximum mass of the static and spherically symmetric solutions. For some extremely strong magnetic field configurations, we also obtain solutions more massive than the maximum mass of the uniformly rotating solutions at the Kepler (mass-shedding) limit, namely magnetically hypermassive solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first analysis of traversable wormhole solutions within the framework
  of Einstein-aether theory. We show that the corresponding field equations admit three
  distinct wormhole geometries, obtained by adopting three different classes of combinations
  for the aether coupling constants. We examine the null and weak energy conditions for
  three types of wormhole shape functions. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to Einstein
  gravity, by choosing appropriate parameter values, wormhole geometries can satisfy the
  energy conditions at the wormhole throat. We also nd that in one class, wormholes
  can satisfy the energy conditions not only at the wormhole throat but also throughout
  the entire spacetime. Furthermore, the requirement of energy condition satisfaction,
  imposes some constraints on the values of aether coupling constants. By comparing these
  constraints with those previously obtained from theoretical and observational analyses,
  we nd that the satisfaction of energy conditions put more stringent limits on the allowed
  values of the aether couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study general $f(R,\phi)$ theories in Palatini formalism and attempt to constrain the behavior of ones that could support both inflationary and late-time expansion era in a unified model. In particular, we find conditions for which the theories remain consistent in weak gravity regimes as well as cosmic expansion eras in both early and late universe. Assuming that the curvature part of the $f(R,\phi)$ behaves as Starobinsky gravity, we assess post-inflation dynamical stability of the theory in Einstein frame and proceed to isolate two distinct fixed points that provide a stable late-time accelerating universe. Comparison with DESI, Cosmic Chronometers, and SNeIa datasets adds more stringent constraints to the behavior of the theory near the present epoch, giving us one stable fixed point where expansion is driven by a phantom scalar field. However, time scales of the two fixed points suggest that this fixed point may be transient and may eventually evolve toward a stable expansion stage driven potential domination in the distant future of the universe.</description>

      <title>Local Well-posedenss of the Bartnik Static Extension Problem near Schwarzschild spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the local well-posedness of the Bartnik static metric extension problem for arbitrary Bartnik data that perturb that of any sphere in a Schwarzschild $\{t=0\}$ slice. Our result in particular includes spheres with arbitrary small mean curvature. We introduce a new framework to this extension problem by formulating the governing equations in a geodesic gauge, which reduce to a coupled system of elliptic and transport equations. Since standard function spaces for elliptic PDEs are unsuitable for transport equations, we use certain spaces of Bochner-measurable functions traditionally used to study evolution equations. In the process, we establish existence and uniqueness results for elliptic boundary value problems in such spaces in which the elliptic equations are treated as evolutionary equations, and solvability is demonstrated using rigorous energy estimates. The precise nature of the expected difficulty of solving the Bartnik extension problem when the mean curvature is very small is identified and suitably treated in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Scattering, Polyhomogeneity and Asymptotics for Quasilinear Wave Equations From Past to Future Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general construction of semiglobal scattering solutions to quasilinear wave equations in a neighbourhood of spacelike infinity including past and future null infinity, where the scattering data are posed on an ingoing null cone and along past null infinity. More precisely, we prove weighted, optimal-in-decay energy estimates and propagation of polyhomogeneity statements from past to future null infinity for these solutions, we provide an algorithmic procedure how to compute the precise coefficients in the arising polyhomogeneous expansions, and we apply this procedure to various examples. As a corollary, our results directly imply the summability in the spherical harmonic number $\ell$ of the estimates proved for fixed spherical harmonic modes in the papers [Keh22b,KM24] from the series "The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity".
  Our (physical space) methods are based on weighted energy estimates near spacelike infinity similar to those of [HV23], commutations with (modified) scaling vector fields to remove leading order terms in the relevant expansions, time inversions, as well as the Minkowskian conservation laws: $$
  \partial_u(r^{-2\ell}\partial_v(r^2\partial_v)^{\ell}(r\phi_{\ell}))=0, $$ which are satisfied if $\Box_\eta\phi=0$.
  Our scattering constructions apply to systems of equations as well and go beyond the usual class of finite energy solutions. We use this to also derive a scattering theory and prove propagation of polyhomogeneity for the Einstein vacuum equations in a harmonic gauge. In the process, we also need to introduce a novel ansatz accounting for the stronger-than-Schwarzschildean divergence of the light cones, which, in particular, extends existing exterior stability of Minkowski statements in harmonic gauge to allow for slowly decaying data as considered in [Bie10].</description>

      <title>Forecasted Detection Limits on the (Dark) Matter Density in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are among the most powerful known sources of gravitational waves (GWs). Accordingly, these systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Within this domain, SMBHs evolve rapidly and merge with each other. Dynamical friction from stars and gas at the centers of galaxies typically helps to bring together two SMBHs when they are at relatively far separations ($\approx$ kpc $-$ 100 pc), but becomes less efficient at smaller separations. However, dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times. In this paper, we simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to millihertz frequency range and confirm that the GW signals from SMBHBs with DM spikes can be clearly distinguished from those without any additional matter. Making use of the projected sensitivity curve of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we forecast upper limits for the (dark) matter density for given future SMBHB observations. We then compare these thresholds with the theoretical density profiles expected for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) spikes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phenomenologically emergent dark energy model: is non-zero equation of state of dark matter favored by DESI DR2?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Probing Picohertz Gravitational Waves with Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With periods much longer than the duration of current pulsar timing surveys, gravitational waves in the picohertz (pHz) regime are not detectable in the typical analysis framework for pulsar timing data. However, signatures of these low-frequency signals persist in the slow variation of pulsar timing parameters. In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search for continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar timing parameters -- time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period $\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\ddot{P}$. We apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of pulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an order-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is detected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the Square Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the opportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of supermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this signal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding that future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter space. Our new Bayesian technique and leading sensitivity in this frequency domain paves the way for new discoveries in both black hole astrophysics and the search for new physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy in Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates holographic timelike entanglement entropy in higher curvature gravity, with a particular focus on Lovelock theories and on the role of excited states. For strip subsystems, higher-curvature terms are found to affect the imaginary part of the entropy in a dimension-dependent manner, while excited states contribute solely to the real part. For the cases analyzed, spacelike and timelike entanglement entropies exhibit proportional relations: vacuum contributions differ by universal phase factors, while excitation contributions are linked by dimension-dependent rational coefficients. For hyperbolic subsystems, the timelike entanglement entropy computed via complex extremal surfaces is shown to agree with results obtained through analytic continuation, with imaginary contributions appearing in all dimensions. Higher-curvature corrections are explicitly calculated in five- and $(d+1)$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity, illustrating the applicability of the complex surface prescription to general Lovelock corrections. These results provide a controlled setting to examine the influence of higher-curvature interactions on holographic timelike entanglement entropy, and clarify its relation to vacuum and excited-state contributions.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the bulk flat space limit in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flat space limit of scalar bulk fields in AdS is discussed within a Lorentzian canonical quantization setup tailored to describe AdS state preparation and to extract the flat S-matrix dynamics. We discuss how the algebraic \`{I}n\"on\"u-Wigner contraction captures the local physics of the equivalence principle in quantum field theory in a fixed background description. We develop the embedding formalism to describe the bulk AdS scalar primary wave functions as holomorphic functions. Flat space massive particle states are built out of the AdS primary together with AdS boosted wave functions. We compute their inner products and show that these become orthogonal in the flat limit, resulting in the correct continuous spectrum for a standard unitary representation of the Lorentz group. In this same limit the original AdS descendants become null states. We also argue how the flat space S-matrix emerges from standard perturbation theory in the interaction picture. To obtain flat space massless particles requires to consider a double scaled limit in which the boost rapidity is scaled to infinity keeping the average particle energy in the flat space limit fixed. We comment on how this limit generates interesting massless state wave functions with non-trivial shape profiles that remember the dimension of the AdS operator. We discuss some of the puzzles attached to these.</description>

      <title>Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</description>
