      <title>Local statistical moments to capture Kramers-Moyal coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative local statistical moment approach for estimating Kramers-Moyal coefficients, effectively bridging the gap between nonparametric and parametric methodologies. These coefficients play a crucial role in characterizing stochastic processes. Our proposed approach provides a versatile framework for localized coefficient estimation, combining the flexibility of nonparametric methods with the interpretability of global parametric approaches. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through use cases involving both stationary and non-stationary time series analysis. Additionally, we demonstrate its applicability to real-world complex systems, specifically in the energy conversion process analysis of a wind turbine.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-based schemes for on-the-fly parameter estimation in dissipative dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies two particular algorithms, a Relaxation Least Squares (RLS) algorithm and a Relaxation Newton Iteration (RNI) scheme , for reconstructing unknown parameters in dissipative dynamical systems. Both algorithms are based on a continuous data assimilation (CDA) algorithm for state reconstruction of A. Azouani, E. Olson, and E.S. Titi \cite{Azouani_Olson_Titi_2014}. Due to the CDA origins of these parameter recovery algorithms, these schemes provide on-the-fly reconstruction, that is, as data is collected, of unknown state and parameters simultaneously. It is shown how both algorithms give way to a robust general framework for simultaneous state and parameter estimation. In particular, we develop a general theory, applicable to a large class of dissipative dynamical systems, which identifies structural and algorithmic conditions under which the proposed algorithms achieve reconstruction of the true parameters. The algorithms are implemented on a high-dimensional two-layer Lorenz 96 model, where the theoretical conditions of the general framework are explicitly verifiable. They are also implemented on the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithms beyond the finite-dimensional setting. In each case, systematic numerical experiments are carried out probing the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, in addition to the apparent benefits and drawbacks between them.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Langevin power curve analysis by separation per operational state</title>

Abstract: In the last few years, the dynamical characterization of the power output of a wind turbine by means of a Langevin equation has been well established. For this approach, temporally highly resolved measurements of wind speed and power output are used to obtain the drift and diffusion coefficients of the energy conversion process. These coefficients fully determine a Langevin stochastic differential equation with Gaussian white noise. The drift term specifies the deterministic behavior of the system whereas the diffusion term describes the stochastic behavior of the system. A precise estimation of these coefficients is essential to understand the dynamics of the power conversion process of the wind turbine. We show that the dynamics of the power output of a wind turbine have a hidden dependency on turbine's different operational states. Here, we use an approach based on clustering Pearson correlation matrices for different observables on a moving time window to identify different operational states. We have identified five operational states in total, for example the state of rated power. Those different operational states distinguish non-stationary behavior in the mutual dependencies and represent different turbine control settings. As a next step, we condition our Langevin analysis on these different states to reveal distinctly different behaviors of the power conversion process for each operational state. Moreover, in our new representation hysteresis effects which have typically appeared in the Langevin dynamics of wind turbines seem to be resolved. We assign these typically observed hysteresis effects clearly to the change of the wind energy system between our estimated different operational states. In this contribution, we discuss further consequences for the meaning of hysteric switching and detection of malbehaviors in wind turbines.</description>

      <title>Dominant misconceptions and alluvial flows between Engineering and Physical Science students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we assess the comprehension of physics concepts by Physical Science and Engineering students enrolled in their first semester at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa ($2022$). We employ different graphical measures to explore similarities and differences using the results of both pre- and post-test data from the Force Concept Inventory assessment tool, from which we calculate dominant misconceptions (DMs) and gains. We also use alluvial diagrams to track the choices made by these two groups of students from pre- to post-test stages. In our analysis, we find that DMs results indicate that participating Engineering students outperformed Physical Science students on average. However, the same types of normalised DMs persist at the post-test level. This is very useful when tracking persistent misconceptions, where when using repeated measures and alluvial diagrams with smaller groups of students, we find that Physical Science students tend to make more chaotic choices.</description>
