      <title>Global Balance and Systemic Risk in Financial Correlation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the global balance index of financial correlation networks can be used as a systemic risk measure. We define the global balance of a network starting from a diffusive process that describes how the information spreads across nodes in a network, providing an alternative derivation to the usual combinatorial one. The steady state of this process is the solution of a linear system governed by the exponential of the replication matrix of the process. We provide a bridge between the numerical stability of this linear system, measured by the condition number in an opportune norm, and the structural predictability of the underlying signed network. The link between the condition number and related systemic risk measures, such as the market rank indicators, allows the global balance index to be interpreted as a new systemic risk measure. A comprehensive empirical application to real financial data finally confirms that the global balance index of the financial correlation network represents a valuable and effective systemic risk indicator.</description>

      <title>Construction and Hedging of Equity Index Options Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of systematic index option-writing strategies, focusing on S&amp;P500 index options. We compare the performance of hedging strategies using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model and the Variance-Gamma (VG) model, emphasizing varying moneyness levels and different sizing methods based on delta and the VIX Index. The study employs 1-minute data of S&amp;P500 index options and index quotes spanning from 2018 to 2023. The analysis benchmarks hedged strategies against buy-and-hold and naked option-writing strategies, with a focus on risk-adjusted performance metrics including transaction costs. Portfolio delta approximations are derived using implied volatility for the BSM model and market-calibrated parameters for the VG model. Key findings reveal that systematic option-writing strategies can potentially yield superior returns compared to buy-and-hold benchmarks. The BSM model generally provided better hedging outcomes than the VG model, although the VG model showed profitability in certain naked strategies as a tool for position sizing. In terms of rehedging frequency, we found that intraday hedging in 130-minute intervals provided both reliable protection against adverse market movements and a satisfactory returns profile.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Error Analysis of Multilevel Stochastic Approximations for the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cr\'epey, Frikha, and Louzi (2023) introduced a nested stochastic approximation algorithm and its multilevel acceleration to compute the value-at-risk and expected shortfall of a random financial loss. We hereby establish central limit theorems for the renormalized estimation errors associated with both algorithms as well as their averaged versions. Our findings are substantiated through a numerical example.</description>
