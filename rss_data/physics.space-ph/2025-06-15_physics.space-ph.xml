      <title>Suppressing spurious oscillations and particle noise in particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are essential for studying kinetic plasma processes, but they often suffer from statistical noise, especially in plasmas with fast flows. We have also found that the typical central difference scheme used in PIC codes to solve Maxwell's equations produces spurious oscillations near discontinuities, which can lead to unphysical solutions. In this work, we present numerical techniques to address these challenges within the semi-implicit PIC code FLEKS, which is based on the Gauss's Law-satisfying Energy-Conserving Semi-Implicit Particle-in-Cell method (GL-ECSIM). First, we introduce a Lax-Friedrichs-type diffusion term with a flux limiter into the Maxwell solver to suppress unphysical oscillations near discontinuities. Second, we propose a novel approach for calculating the current density in the comoving frame, which significantly reduces particle noise in simulations with fast plasma flows. Numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in mitigating spurious oscillations and noise in shock and magnetic reconnection simulations.</description>

      <title>Loss of 12 Starlink Satellites Due to Pre-conditioning of Intense Space Weather Activity Surrounding the Extreme Geomagnetic Storm of 10 May 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the orbital decay and subsequent reentries of 12 Starlink satellites from 16 April to 15 May 2024. By examining Two-Line Element data, we observed a significant increase in orbital decay following the geomagnetic storm on 10 May 2024, consistent with expectations of increased thermospheric density. An unexpected increase in decay rates for 10 satellites was identified around 25 April 2024, while two lower-altitude satellites remained unaffected. Detailed analysis revealed that this enhanced decay rate prior to the storm was influenced by a spike in the O/N2 ratio and an increase in Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) flux. Moreover, most of the satellites exhibited sharp decay during the early recovery phase of the geomagnetic storm. Based on the positions and local times of changes in decay rates, it is likely that the satellites were affected by various processes during elevated space weather activity, such as enhanced EUV flux, Joule heating, particle precipitation, and the equatorial neutral anomaly. This study highlights the complex role of preconditioning due to enhanced EUV flux and extreme space weather activity in the orbital dynamics of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.</description>

      <title>Eastward Transients in the Dayside Ionosphere II: A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Like Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven, energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations. We detailed this in a companion paper. In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines -- observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'. We propose that transient eastward electrodynamic bursts in the dayside ionosphere might be a common, albeit previously unresolved, feature of geomagnetic storms.</description>
