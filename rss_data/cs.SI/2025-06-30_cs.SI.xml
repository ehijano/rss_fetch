      <title>Quantifying Institutional Gender Inequality in Contemporary Visual Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From disparities in the number of exhibiting artists to auction opportunities, there is evidence of women's under-representation in visual art. Here we explore the exhibition history and auction sales of 65,768 contemporary artists in 20,389 institutions, revealing gender differences in the artist population, exhibitions and auctions. We distinguish between two criteria for gender equity: gender-neutrality, when artists have gender-independent access to exhibition opportunities, and gender-balanced, that strives for gender parity in representation, finding that 58\% of institutions are gender-neutral but only 24\% are gender-balanced, and that the fraction of man-overrepresented institutions increases with institutional prestige. We define artist's co-exhibition gender to capture the gender inequality of the institutions that an artist exhibits. Finally, we use logistic regression to predict an artist's access to the auction market, finding that co-exhibition gender has a stronger correlation with success than the artist's gender. These results help unveil and quantify the institutional forces that relate to the persistent gender imbalance in the art world.</description>

      <title>The Missing Link: Joint Legal Citation Prediction using Heterogeneous Graph Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal systems heavily rely on cross-citations of legal norms as well as previous court decisions. Practitioners, novices and legal AI systems need access to these relevant data to inform appraisals and judgments. We propose a Graph-Neural-Network (GNN) link prediction model that can identify Case-Law and Case-Case citations with high proficiency through fusion of semantic and topological information. We introduce adapted relational graph convolutions operating on an extended and enriched version of the original citation graph that allow the topological integration of semantic meta-information. This further improves prediction by 3.1 points of average precision and by 8.5 points in data sparsity as well as showing robust performance over time and in challenging fully inductive prediction. Jointly learning and predicting case and norm citations achieves a large synergistic effect that improves case citation prediction by up to 4.7 points, at almost doubled efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Decade of News Forum Interactions: Threaded Conversations, Signed Votes, and Topical Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a large-scale, longitudinal dataset capturing user activity on the online platform of DerStandard, a major Austrian newspaper. The dataset spans ten years (2013-2022) and includes over 75 million user comments, more than 400 million votes, and detailed metadata on articles and user interactions. It provides structured conversation threads, explicit up- and downvotes of user comments and editorial topic labels, enabling rich analyses of online discourse while preserving user privacy. To ensure this privacy, all persistent identifiers are anonymized using salted hash functions, and the raw comment texts are not publicly shared. Instead, we release pre-computed vector representations derived from a state-of-the-art embedding model. The dataset supports research on discussion dynamics, network structures, and semantic analyses in the mid-resourced language German, offering a reusable resource across computational social science and related fields.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Network Topology on the Equilibria of Influence-Opinion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social networks exert a powerful influence on public opinion. Adversaries weaponize these networks to manipulate discourse, underscoring the need for more resilient social networks. To this end, we investigate the impact of network connectivity on Stackelberg equilibria in a two-player game to shape public opinion. We model opinion evolution as a repeated competitive influence-propagation process. Players iteratively inject \textit{messages} that diffuse until reaching a steady state, modeling the dispersion of two competing messages. Opinions then update according to the discounted sum of exposure to the messages. This bi-level model captures viral-media correlation effects omitted by standard opinion-dynamics models. To solve the resulting high-dimensional game, we propose a scalable, iterative algorithm based on linear-quadratic regulators that approximates local feedback Stackelberg strategies for players with limited cognition. We analyze how the network topology shapes equilibrium outcomes through experiments on synthetic networks and real Facebook data. Our results identify structural characteristics that improve a network's resilience to adversarial influence, guiding the design of more resilient social networks.</description>

      <title>How Large Language Models play humans in online conversations: a simulated study of the 2016 US politics on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario: Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular, we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments, both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions, influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.</description>

      <title>The relationship between episcopal genealogy and ideology in the Roman Catholic Church</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we investigate how hierarchical structures within the Roman Catholic Church shape the ideological orientation of its leadership. The full episcopal genealogy dataset comprises over 35,000 bishops, each typically consecrated by one principal consecrator and two co-consecrators, forming a dense and historically continuous directed network of episcopal lineage. Within this broader structure, we focus on a dataset of 245 living cardinals to examine whether genealogical proximity correlates with doctrinal alignment on a broad set of theological and sociopolitical issues. We identify motifs that capture recurring patterns of lineage, such as shared consecrators or co-consecrators. In parallel, we apply natural language processing techniques to extract each cardinal's publicly stated positions on ten salient topics, including LGBTQIA+ rights, women's roles in the Church, liturgy, bioethics, priestly celibacy, and migration. Our results show that cardinals linked by specific genealogical motifs, particularly those who share the same principal consecrator, are significantly more likely to exhibit ideological similarity. We find that the influence of pope John Paul II persists through the bishops he consecrated, who demonstrate systematically more conservative views than their peers. These findings underscore the role of hierarchical mentorship in shaping ideological coherence within large-scale religious institutions. Our contribution offers quantitative evidence that institutional lineages, beyond individual background factors, may have an impact on the transmission and consolidation of doctrinal positions over time.</description>

      <title>Harder, shorter, sharper, forward: A comparison of women's and men's elite football gameplay (2020-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elite football is believed to have evolved in recent years, but systematic evidence for the pace and form of that change is sparse. Drawing on event-level records for 13,067 matches in ten top-tier men's and women's leagues in England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and the United States (2020-2025), we quantify match dynamics with two views: conventional performance statistics and pitch-passing networks that track ball movement among a grid of pitch (field) regions. Between 2020 and 2025, average passing volume, pass accuracy, and the percent of passes made under pressure all rose. In general, the largest year-on-year changes occurred in women's competitions. Network measures offer alternative but complementary perspectives on the changing gameplay in recent years, normalized outreach in the pitch passing networks decreased, while the average shortest path lengths increased, indicating a wider ball circulation. Together, these indicators point to a sustained intensification of collective play across contemporary professional football.</description>

      <title>Characterization Of Diseases In Temporal Comorbidity Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comorbidity networks, which capture disease-disease co-occurrence usually based on electronic health records, reveal structured patterns in how diseases cluster and progress across individuals. However, how these networks evolve across different age groups and how this evolution relates to properties like disease prevalence and mortality remains understudied. To address these issues, we used publicly available comorbidity networks extracted from a comprehensive dataset of 45 million Austrian hospital stays from 1997 to 2014, covering 8.9 million patients. These networks grow and become denser with age. We identified groups of diseases that exhibit similar patterns of structural centrality throughout the lifespan, revealing three dominant age-related components with peaks in early childhood, midlife, and late life. To uncover the drivers of this structural change, we examined the relationship between prevalence and degree. This allowed us to identify conditions that were disproportionately connected to other diseases. Using betweenness centrality in combination with mortality data, we further identified high-mortality bridging diseases. Several diseases show high connectivity relative to their prevalence, such as iron deficiency anemia (D50) in children, nicotine dependence (F17), and lipoprotein metabolism disorders (E78) in adults. We also highlight structurally central diseases with high mortality that emerge at different life stages, including cancers (C group), liver cirrhosis (K74), subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60), and chronic kidney disease (N18). These findings underscore the importance of targeting age-specific, network-central conditions with high mortality for prevention and integrated care.</description>

      <title>Design of A* based heuristic algorithm for efficient interdiction in multi-Layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction with Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The message-passing mechanism underlying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is not naturally suited for heterophilic datasets, where adjacent nodes often have different labels. Most solutions to this problem remain confined to the task of node classification. In this article, we focus on the valuable task of link prediction under heterophily, an interesting problem for recommendation systems, social network analysis, and other applications. GNNs like GRAFF have improved node classification under heterophily by incorporating physics biases in the architecture. Similarly, we propose GRAFF-LP, an extension of GRAFF for link prediction. We show that GRAFF-LP effectively discriminates existing from non-existing edges by learning implicitly to separate the edge gradients. Based on this information, we propose a new readout function inspired by physics. Remarkably, this new function not only enhances the performance of GRAFF-LP but also improves that of other baseline models, leading us to reconsider how every link prediction experiment has been conducted so far. Finally, we provide evidence that even simple GNNs did not experience greater difficulty in predicting heterophilic links compared to homophilic ones. This leads us to believe in the necessity for heterophily measures specifically tailored for link prediction, distinct from those used in node classification. The code and appendix are available at https://github.com/difra100/Link_Prediction_with_PIGNN_IJCNN.</description>

      <title>No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- graph structure and node features --, we introduce Rings, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods from a distinct angle. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for dataset evaluation via extensive experiments on graph-level tasks and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</description>
