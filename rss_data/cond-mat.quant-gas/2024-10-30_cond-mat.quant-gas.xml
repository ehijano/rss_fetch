      <title>Effective tight-binding models in optical moir\'e potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A twist between two systems offers the possibility to drastically change the underlying physical properties. To that end, we study the bandstructure of twisted moir\'e potentials in detail. At sets of commensurate twisting angles, the low energy single-particle spectrum of a twisted moir\'e potential will form into distinct bands and gaps. To a first approximation, energy bands can be qualitatively modelled by harmonic states, localised in different potential minima. The bands are intrinsically linked to the number of distinct minima and size of the moir\'e unit cell, with smaller cells producing larger gaps and vice versa. For shallower potential depths, degeneracies between harmonic states are lifted by virtue of anharmonic confinement and coupling between states. Depending on the exact geometry of potential minima, bands can then be classified by $4$ unique forms of tight-binding models. We find excellent agreement between the continuous spectrum and fitting to our tight-binding models, allowing for accurate tunnelling rates and onsite energies to be extracted. Our results are directly relevant to the bosonic, many-body problem, and thus provide further understanding on the relative stability of quantum phases both in theory and experiments. In particular, the prominence of gaps can be mapped to strongly correlated insulating phases. Furthermore, tunnelling rates of different bands serve as thresholds on temperature in which a phase can be either a normal fluid or superfluid.</description>

      <title>Boson-anyon-fermion mapping in one dimension: Constructing anyonic molecule and superfluidity in a spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an exact mapping between identical particles in one dimension with arbitrary exchange statistics, including bosons, anyons and fermions, provided they share the same scattering length. This boson-anyon-fermion mapping facilitates the construction of anyons from a linear superposition of spatially symmetric and anti-symmetric states. We demonstrate this in a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with coexistent s- and p-wave interactions, where both types of bound states can be supported by manipulating spin channels. A suitable symmetry-breaking field then hybridizes these states to form anyonic molecules. The condensation of these molecules in a many-body system leads to anyonic superfluidity, characterized by fractional statistics upon spin exchange within a Cooper pair. These anyonic states can be detected through asymmetric momentum distributions with a chiral $k^{-3}$ tail for each spin at high momentum. Our results propose a convenient route for engineering fractional statistics and associated intriguing phases in the platform of ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Antichiral and trap-skin dynamics in a nonreciprocal bosonic two-leg ladder with artificial magnetic flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity and synthetic gauge fields play two fundamental roles in engineering exotic phases and dynamics in artificial quantum systems. Here we explore the mean-field dynamics of interacting bosons in a two-leg ladder with synthetic magnetic flux and nonreciprocal hopping under the open boundary condition. In the Hermitian limit, we showcase the breakdown of the flux-driven chiral dynamics due to the nonlinear self-trapping effect. We further find that the nonreciprocity can drive the transition between chiral dynamics and antichiral dynamics. The antichiral motion is manifested as the non-Hermitian skin dynamics along the same direction on two legs that are not suppressed by the magnetic flux, while the chiral-antichiral transition is flux-tunable. We also reveal the trap-skin dynamics with the coexistence of the self-tapping and skin dynamics in the ladder. Dynamical phase diagrams with respect to the chiral-antichiral dynamics, skin dynamics, self-trapping dynamics, and trap-skin dynamics are presented. Our results shed light on intriguing dynamical phenomena under the interplay among non-Hermiticity, nonlinearity, and artificial gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-body Scars through the Lens of Correlation Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS with either known analytic expressions or can be captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively isolate QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables easy manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations and universal coarsening dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22178v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective excitation spectrum of a Raman-induced spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a quasi-one-dimensional harmonic trap while varying either the Raman coupling or quadratic Zeeman term by using the Bogoliubov approach. A few low-lying modes, which can be used to delineate the phase boundaries, are identified by exciting them with suitable perturbations. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 condensate by quenching from the zero-momentum into the plane wave phase through a sudden change in Raman coupling strength. We demonstrate that the correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamic scaling during the late-time dynamics, allowing us to determine the dynamic critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Bilayer Superfluid with Interlayer Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the coupling between different degrees of freedom in many-body systems is a powerful technique for engineering novel phases of matter. We create a bilayer system of two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gases and demonstrate the controlled generation of bulk coherence through tunable interlayer Josephson coupling. We probe the resulting correlated phases using matter-wave interferometry, measuring both the symmetric and antisymmetric phase modes of the bilayer system. These modes exhibit a crossover from short-range to quasi-long-range order above a coupling-dependent critical point, providing direct evidence of bilayer superfluidity mediated by interlayer coupling. We map out the phase diagram and interpret it with renormalization-group theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through the observation of suppressed vortex excitations in the antisymmetric mode.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry dynamics on Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) that interchanges fermions and bosons is of great theoretical importance but has not yet been revealed experimentally in particle physics. It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models. Inspired by the recent experiments of Floquet engineering of Rydberg atom arrays, we find that quantum mechanical SUSY can be realized in Floquet Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments. This work sheds light on the future experimental exploration of SUSY with the help of Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Spin-1 Haldane phase in a chain of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol to implement a spin-1 chain in Rydberg systems using three Rydberg states close to a F\"orster resonance. In addition to dipole-dipole interactions, strong van der Waals interactions naturally appear due to the presence of the F\"orster resonance and give rise to a highly tunable Hamiltonian. The resulting phase diagram is studied using the infinite density-matrix renormalization group and reveals a highly robust Haldane phase -- a prime example of a symmetry protected topological phase. We find experimentally accessible parameters to probe the Haldane phase in current Rydberg systems, and demonstrate an efficient adiabatic preparation scheme. This paves the way to probe the remarkable properties of spin fractionalization in the Haldane phase.</description>

      <title>From spin squeezing to fast state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is great interest in generating and controlling entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates and similar ensembles for use in quantum computation, simulation, and sensing. One class of entangled states useful for enhanced metrology are spin-squeezed states of $N$ two-level atoms. After preparing a spin coherent state of width $1/\sqrt{N}$ centered at coordinates $( \theta, \phi) $ on the Bloch sphere, atomic interactions generate a nonlinear evolution that shears the state's probability density, stretching it to an ellipse and causing squeezing in a direction perpendicular to the major axis. Here we consider the same setup but in the $N \rightarrow \infty $ limit . This shrinks the initial coherent state to zero area. Large $N$ also suppresses two-particle entanglement and squeezing, as required by a monogamy bound. The torsion (1-axis twist) is still present, however, and the center of the large $N$ coherent state evolves as a qubit governed by a two-state Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The resulting nonlinearity is known to be a powerful resource in quantum computation. It can be used to implement single-input quantum state discrimination, an impossibility within linear one-particle quantum mechanics. We obtain a solution to the discrimination problem in terms of a Viviani curve on the Bloch sphere. We also consider an open-system variant containing both Bloch sphere torsion and dissipation. In this case it should be possible to generate two basins of attraction within the Bloch ball, having a shared boundary that can be used for a type of autonomous state discrimination. We explore these and other connections between spin squeezing in the large $N$ limit and nonlinear quantum gates, and argue that a two-component condensate is a promising platform for realizing a nonlinear qubit.</description>

      <title>Mott-glass phase induced by long-range correlated disorder in a one-dimensional Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the phase diagram of a one-dimensional Bose gas in the presence of disorder with short- and long-range correlations, the latter decaying with distance as $1/|x|^{1+\sigma}$. When $\sigma&lt;0$, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition between the superfluid and the localized phase is driven by the long-range correlations and the Luttinger parameter $K$ takes the critical value $K_c(\sigma)=3/2-\sigma/2$. The localized phase is a Bose glass for $\sigma&gt;\sigma_c=3-\pi^2/3\simeq -0.289868$, and a Mott glass -- characterized by a vanishing compressibility and a gapless conductivity -- when $\sigma&lt;\sigma_c$. Our conclusions, based on the nonperturbative functional renormalization group and perturbative renormalization group, are confirmed by the study of the case $\sigma=-1$, corresponding to a perfectly correlated disorder in space, where the model is exactly solvable in the semiclassical limit $K\to 0^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting non-trivial Euler class, a multi-gap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to DC conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multi-band invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter, fundamental high-energy processes, quantum metrology, and quantum algorithms. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>
