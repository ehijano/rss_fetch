      <title>Open-System Virus Particle Physics: A Non-Self-Adjoint, Stochastic PDE, and Fock-Space Framework for Many-Lattice Viral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical biophysics framework integrating virophysics and advanced PDE analysis to model damped viral phonon dynamics under multiplicative noise. Our approach accommodates unbounded viral lattices by lifting a non self adjoint single lattice operator (assumed m sectorial or maximally dissipative) with external forcing or operator valued noise into a second quantized setting on bosonic or fermionic Fock spaces. This many lattice evolution is governed by a non unitary semigroup admitting both equilibrium and non equilibrium steady states, enabling flux and cycle analyses when detailed balance is broken. Extending the PDE layer with multiplicative noise preserves m sectorial structure, crucial for capturing resource limited and stochastic viral behavior.
  We propose two additional axioms to formalize observed phenomena. First, the Axiom of Non Equilibrium Flux Persistence asserts that sustained energy input generates persistent probability current loops in state space, revealing topological obstructions to detailed balance. Second, the Axiom of Stochastic Continuity of Lattice Evolution stipulates that m sectorial PDEs with operator valued noise remain well posed and capture subcellular variability. These axioms emphasize a cohomological perspective on flux loops, highlighting resource driven irreversibility and the capacity for viral capsids to reconfigure at steady state.
  We provide a step by step derivation of the non self adjoint operator constructions, prove well posedness via the Lumer Phillips and Hille Yosida theorems, and unify Markov jumps, replication annihilation events, and PDEs with complex damping in a single framework. The resulting theory offers a rigorous description of viral lattice dynamics far from equilibrium, clarifies the topological nature of persistent capsid rearrangements.</description>

      <title>Instability of a fluctuating biomimetic membrane driven by an applied uniform DC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking account to the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layer redistributes and destabilizes the membrane via electrical surface stress interior and exterior to the membrane. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.</description>

      <title>Form and function in biological filaments: A physicist's review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature uses elongated shapes and filaments to build stable structures, generate motion, and allow complex geometric interactions. In this Review, we examine the role of biological filaments across different length scales. From the molecular scale, where cytoskeletal filaments provides a robust but dynamic cellular scaffolding, over the scale of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella, to the scale of filamentous microorganisms like cyanobacteria which are among the most successful genera on Earth, and even to the scale of elongated animals like worms and snakes, whose motility modes inspire robotic analogues. We highlight the general mechanisms that couple form and function. Physical principles, such as classical elasticity and the non-reciprocity of active matter can be used to trace unifying themes linking these systems spanning about six orders of magnitude in length.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Nonlinear Stability of Finite-Energy Solutions of the Compressible Euler-Riesz Equations with Large Initial Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compressible Euler-Riesz equations are fundamental with wide applications in astrophysics, plasma physics, and mathematical biology. In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence and nonlinear stability of finite-energy solutions of the multidimensional Euler-Riesz equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry. We consider both attractive and repulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for dimensions larger than or equal to two. This is achieved by the inviscid limit of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes-Riesz equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing viscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It is observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no concentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit. Moreover, we prove that the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the Euler-Riesz equations is unconditional under a spherically symmetric perturbation around the steady solutions. Unlike the Coulomb case where the potential can be represented locally, the singularity and regularity of the nonlocal radial Riesz potential near the origin require careful analysis, which is a crucial step. Finally, unlike the Coulomb case, a Gr\"onwall type estimate is required to overcome the difficulty of the appearance of boundary terms in the sub-Coulomb case and the singularity of the super-Coulomb potential. Furthermore, we prove the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the compressible Euler-Riesz equations around steady states by employing concentration compactness arguments. Steady states properties are obtained by variational arguments connecting to recent advances in aggregation-diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The droplet size distribution typically decays exponentially in solutions formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Nevertheless, a power-law distribution of nucleoli volumes has been observed in amphibian oocytes, which appears similar to the cluster size distribution in reaction-limited aggregation. In this work, we study the mechanism of power-law distributed droplet sizes and unveil a self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion between droplets. Surprisingly, the droplet size dynamics is governed by a similar Smoluchowski equation as the cluster size in aggregation systems. The system reaches a critical state as the area fraction approaches the critical value at which the droplet size has a power-law distribution with a $1.5$ exponent. Furthermore, the system is also spatially scale-free with a divergent correlation length at the critical state, marked by giant droplet-density fluctuations and power-law decay of the pair correlation function.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>
