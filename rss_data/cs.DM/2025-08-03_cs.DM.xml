      <title>Computation of Approximately Stable Committees in Approval-based Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approval-based committee selection is a model of significant interest in social choice theory. In this model, we have a set of voters $\mathcal{V}$, a set of candidates $\mathcal{C}$, and each voter has a set $A_v \subset \mathcal{C}$ of approved candidates. For any committee size $K$, the goal is to choose $K$ candidates to represent the voters' preferences. We study a criterion known as \emph{approximate stability}, where a committee is $\lambda$-approximately-stable if there is no other committee $T$ preferred by at least $\frac{\lambda|T|}{k} |\mathcal{V}| $ voters. We prove that a $3.65$-approximately stable committee always exists and can be computed algorithmically in this setting. Our approach is based on finding a Lindahl equilibrium and sampling from a strongly Rayleigh distribution associated with it.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Inapproximability of E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration problem, we are given a satisfiable $k$-CNF formula $\varphi$ where each clause contains exactly $k$ literals, along with a pair of its satisfying assignments. The objective is transform one satisfying assignment into the other by repeatedly flipping the value of a single variable, while maximizing the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses of $\varphi$ throughout the transformation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the optimal approximation factor for Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration is $1 - \Theta\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$. On the algorithmic side, we develop a deterministic $\left(1-\frac{1}{k-1}-\frac{1}{k}\right)$-factor approximation algorithm for every $k \geq 3$. On the hardness side, we show that it is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard to approximate this problem within a factor of $1-\frac{1}{10k}$ for every sufficiently large $k$. Note that an ``$\mathsf{NP}$ analogue'' of Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration is Max E$k$-SAT, whose approximation threshold is $1-\frac{1}{2^k}$ shown by H\r{a}stad (JACM 2001). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reconfiguration problem whose approximation threshold is (asymptotically) worse than that of its $\mathsf{NP}$ analogue. To prove the hardness result, we introduce a new ``non-monotone'' test, which is specially tailored to reconfiguration problems, despite not being helpful in the PCP regime.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of the Graph-Structural and Optimization-Based Characterizations of Popular Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popular matchings provide a model of matching under preferences in which a solution corresponds to a Condorcet winner in voting systems. In a bipartite graph in which the vertices have preferences over their neighbours, a matching is defined to be popular if it does not lose in a majority vote against any matching. In this paper, we study the following three primary problems: only the vertices on one side have preferences; a generalization of this problem allowing ties in the preferences; and the vertices on both sides have preferences. A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings is how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires exponential time if the definition is simply applied. In the literature, we have the following two types of characterizations: a graph-structural characterization; and an optimization-based characterization described by maximum-weight matchings. The graph-structural characterizations are specifically designed for each problem and provide a combinatorial structure of the popular matchings. The optimization-based characterizations work in the same manner for all problems, while they do not reveal the structure of the popular matchings. A main contribution of this paper is to provide a direct connection of the above two types of characterizations for all of the three problems. Specifically, we prove that each characterization can be derived from the other, without relying on the fact that they characterize popular matchings. Our proofs offer a comprehensive understanding of the equivalence of the two types of characterizations, and suggest a new interpretation of the graph-structural characterization in terms of the dual optimal solution for the maximum-weight matching problem.</description>

      <title>Dudeney's Dissection is Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle \dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation).
  Four weeks later, Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains perhaps the most famous example of dissection.
  In this paper (over a century later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal pieces.
  We reduce the problem to the analysis of discrete graph structures representing the correspondence between the edges and the vertices of the pieces forming each polygon.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-free Quantum Adder with Sublinear Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first exact quantum adder with sublinear depth and no ancilla qubits. Our construction is based on classical reversible logic only and employs low-depth implementations for the CNOT ladder operator and the Toffoli ladder operator, two key components to perform ripple-carry addition. Namely, we demonstrate that any ladder of $n$ CNOT gates can be replaced by a CNOT-circuit with $O(\log n)$ depth, while maintaining a linear number of gates. We then generalize this construction to Toffoli gates and demonstrate that any ladder of $n$ Toffoli gates can be substituted with a circuit with $O(\log^2 n)$ depth while utilizing a linearithmic number of gates. This builds on the recent works of Nie et al. and Khattar and Gidney on the technique of conditionally clean ancillae. By combining these two key elements, we present a novel approach to design quantum adders that can perform the addition of two $n$-bit numbers in depth $O(\log^2 n)$ without the use of any ancilla and using classical reversible logic only (Toffoli, CNOT and X gates). We also present new constructions for incrementing and adding a constant to a quantum register.</description>
