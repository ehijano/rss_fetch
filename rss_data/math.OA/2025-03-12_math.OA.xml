      <title>Towards a noncommutative theory of Cowen-Douglas class of noncommuting operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Cowen-Douglas class of (commuting tuples of) operators possessing an open set of (joint) eigenvalues of finite constant multiplicity was introduced by Cowen and Douglas, generalizing the backward shifts. Their unitary equivalence classes are determined by the equivalence classes of certain hermitian holomorphic vector bundles associated with them on this set.
  This article develops a free noncommutative analogue of Cowen-Douglas theory to explore the notion of vector bundles in the setting of free noncommutative function theory. We define the noncommutative Cowen-Douglas class using matricial joint eigenvalues, as envisioned by Taylor, and show via the Taylor-Taylor series that the associated joint eigenspaces naturally form such a vector bundle, what we call a noncommutative hermitian holomorphic vector bundle.
  A key result is that the unitary equivalence class of a tuple in this class is completely determined by the equivalence class of its associated noncommutative vector bundle. This work lays the groundwork of the noncommutative hermitian geometry, which investigates noncommutative analogues of complex manifolds, vector bundles, and hermitian metrics by drawing on ideas from both complex hermitian geometry and operator theory.
  We also examine noncommutative reproducing kernel Hilbert space models and introduce the noncommutative Gleason problem, showing that elements of the noncommutative Cowen-Douglas class are essentially (up to unitary equivalence) adjoints of left multiplication operators by noncommuting independent variables in a noncommutative reproducing kernel Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Products, crossed products, and Zappa--Sz\'ep products for $k$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the lens of Zappa--Sz\'ep decomposition to examine the relationship between directed graph products and $k$-graph products. There are many examples of higher-rank graphs, or $k$-graphs, whose underlying directed graph may be factored as a product, but the $k$-graph itself is not a product. In such examples, we establish that the Zappa--Sz\'ep structure of the $k$-graph gives rise to "actions'' of the underlying directed factors on each other. Although these "actions'' are in general poorly behaved, if one of them is trivial (or trivial up to isomorphism), we obtain a crossed-product-like structure on the $k$-graph. We provide examples where this crossed-product structure is visible in the associated $C^*$-algebra, and we characterize those $k$-graphs whose Zappa--Sz\'ep induced actions are trivial up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint traces on the Pedersen ideal of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to circumvent a fundamental issue when studying densely defined traces on $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras -- which we refer to as the Trace Question -- we initiate a systematic study of the set $T_{\mathbb R}(A)$ of self-adjoint traces on the Pedersen ideal of $A$.
  The set $T_{\mathbb R}(A)$ is a topological vector space with a vector lattice structure, which in the unital setting reflects the Choquet simplex structure of the tracial states. We establish a form of Kadison duality for $T_{\mathbb R}(A)$ and compute $T_{\mathbb R}(A)$ for principal twisted \'etale groupoid $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras. We also answer the Trace Question positively for a large class of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Dual braided quantum $E(2)$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An explicit construction of the braided dual of quantum $E(2)$ groups is described over the circle group $\mathbb{T}$ with respect to a specific $R$-matrix $R$. Additionally, the corresponding bosonization is also described.</description>
