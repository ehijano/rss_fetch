      <title>Core-Periphery Principle Guided State Space Model for Functional Connectome Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the organization of human brain networks has become a central focus in neuroscience, particularly in the study of functional connectivity, which plays a crucial role in diagnosing neurological disorders. Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning techniques have significantly improved brain network analysis. However, traditional machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex relationships between brain regions, while deep learning methods, particularly Transformer-based models, face computational challenges due to their quadratic complexity in long-sequence modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Core-Periphery State-Space Model (CP-SSM), an innovative framework for functional connectome classification. Specifically, we introduce Mamba, a selective state-space model with linear complexity, to effectively capture long-range dependencies in functional brain networks. Furthermore, inspired by the core-periphery (CP) organization, a fundamental characteristic of brain networks that enhances efficient information transmission, we design CP-MoE, a CP-guided Mixture-of-Experts that improves the representation learning of brain connectivity patterns. We evaluate CP-SSM on two benchmark fMRI datasets: ABIDE and ADNI. Experimental results demonstrate that CP-SSM surpasses Transformer-based models in classification performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of CP-SSM in modeling brain functional connectivity, offering a promising direction for neuroimaging-based neurological disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>From Density to Void: Why Brain Networks Fail to Reveal Complex Higher-Order Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In brain network analysis using resting-state fMRI, there is growing interest in modeling higher-order interactions beyond simple pairwise connectivity via persistent homology. Despite the promise of these advanced topological tools, robust and consistently observed higher-order interactions over time remain elusive. In this study, we investigate why conventional analyses often fail to reveal complex higher-order structures - such as interactions involving four or more nodes - and explore whether such interactions truly exist in functional brain networks. We utilize a simplicial complex framework often used in persistent homology to address this question.</description>

      <title>A Foundational Theory for Decentralized Sensory Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both neuroscience and artificial intelligence, popular functional frameworks and neural network formulations operate by making use of extrinsic error measurements and global learning algorithms. Through a set of conjectures based on evolutionary insights on the origin of cellular adaptive mechanisms, we reinterpret the core meaning of sensory signals to allow the brain to be interpreted as a negative feedback control system, and show how this could lead to local learning algorithms without the need for global error correction metrics. Thereby, a sufficiently good minima in sensory activity can be the complete reward signal of the network, as well as being both necessary and sufficient for biological learning to arise. We show that this method of learning was likely already present in the earliest unicellular life forms on earth. We show evidence that the same principle holds and scales to multicellular organisms where it in addition can lead to division of labour between cells. Available evidence shows that the evolution of the nervous system likely was an adaptation to more effectively communicate intercellular signals to support such division of labour. We therefore propose that the same learning principle that evolved already in the earliest unicellular life forms, i.e. negative feedback control of externally and internally generated sensor signals, has simply been scaled up to become a fundament of the learning we see in biological brains today. We illustrate diverse biological settings, from the earliest unicellular organisms to humans, where this operational principle appears to be a plausible interpretation of the meaning of sensor signals in biology, and how this relates to current neuroscientific theories and findings.</description>

      <title>Functional Correspondences in the Human and Marmoset Visual Cortex During Movie Watching: Insights from Correlation, Redundancy, and Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world of beauty is deeply connected to the visual cortex, as perception often begins with vision in both humans and marmosets. Quantifying functional correspondences in the visual cortex across species can help us understand how information is processed in the primate visual cortex, while also providing deeper insights into human visual cortex functions through the study of marmosets. In this study, we measured pairwise and beyond pairwise correlation, redundancy, and synergy in movie-driven fMRI data across species. Our first key finding was that humans and marmosets exhibited significant overlaps in functional synergy. Second, we observed that the strongest functional correspondences between the human peri-entorhinal and entorhinal cortex (PeEc) and the occipitotemporal higher-level visual regions in the marmoset during movie watching reflected a functional synergistic relationship. These regions are known to correspond to face-selective areas in both species. Third, redundancy measures maintained stable high-order hubs, indicating a steady core of shared information processing, while synergy measures revealed a dynamic shift from low- to high-level visual regions as interaction increased, reflecting adaptive integration. This highlights distinct patterns of information processing across the visual hierarchy. Ultimately, our results reveal the marmoset as a compelling model for investigating visual perception, distinguished by its remarkable functional parallels to the human visual cortex.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based motion imitation for physiologically plausible musculoskeletal motor control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do humans move? The quest to understand human motion has broad applications in numerous fields, ranging from computer animation and motion synthesis to neuroscience, human prosthetics and rehabilitation. Although advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have produced impressive results in capturing human motion using simplified humanoids, controlling physiologically accurate models of the body remains an open challenge. In this work, we present a model-free motion imitation framework (KINESIS) to advance the understanding of muscle-based motor control. Using a musculoskeletal model of the lower body with 80 muscle actuators and 20 DoF, we demonstrate that KINESIS achieves strong imitation performance on 1.9 hours of motion capture data, is controllable by natural language through pre-trained text-to-motion generative models, and can be fine-tuned to carry out high-level tasks such as target goal reaching. Importantly, KINESIS generates muscle activity patterns that correlate well with human EMG activity. The physiological plausibility makes KINESIS a promising model for tackling challenging problems in human motor control theory, which we highlight by investigating Bernstein's redundancy problem in the context of locomotion. Code, videos and benchmarks will be available at https://github.com/amathislab/Kinesis.</description>

      <title>Fast Two-photon Microscopy by Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscience to study how the joint activity of large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed for imaging deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is in computational imaging: the co-development of optics and algorithms where the optics are designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, and the algorithms compensate by inverting the optical image coding process to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopic video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the information loss by extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to integrate the fluorescence of neighboring lines into a single set of measurements. By imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame, NORA diversifies the information collected across frames and enables video-level reconstruction. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame using image-level recovery, NORA recovers full video sequences through a nuclear-norm minimization (i.e., matrix completion) on the pixels-by-time matrix. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulation suite. Using these simulations we demonstrate that NORA imaging can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions.</description>
