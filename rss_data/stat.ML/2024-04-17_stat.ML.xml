      <title>Online Estimation via Offline Estimation: An Information-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $ $The classical theory of statistical estimation aims to estimate a parameter of interest under data generated from a fixed design ("offline estimation"), while the contemporary theory of online learning provides algorithms for estimation under adaptively chosen covariates ("online estimation"). Motivated by connections between estimation and interactive decision making, we ask: is it possible to convert offline estimation algorithms into online estimation algorithms in a black-box fashion? We investigate this question from an information-theoretic perspective by introducing a new framework, Oracle-Efficient Online Estimation (OEOE), where the learner can only interact with the data stream indirectly through a sequence of offline estimators produced by a black-box algorithm operating on the stream. Our main results settle the statistical and computational complexity of online estimation in this framework.
  $\bullet$ Statistical complexity. We show that information-theoretically, there exist algorithms that achieve near-optimal online estimation error via black-box offline estimation oracles, and give a nearly-tight characterization for minimax rates in the OEOE framework.
  $\bullet$ Computational complexity. We show that the guarantees above cannot be achieved in a computationally efficient fashion in general, but give a refined characterization for the special case of conditional density estimation: computationally efficient online estimation via black-box offline estimation is possible whenever it is possible via unrestricted algorithms.
  Finally, we apply our results to give offline oracle-efficient algorithms for interactive decision making.</description>

      <title>HELLINGER-UCB: A novel algorithm for stochastic multi-armed bandit problem and cold start problem in recommender system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, where the reward is driven by an unknown random variable. We propose a new variant of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm called Hellinger-UCB, which leverages the squared Hellinger distance to build the upper confidence bound. We prove that the Hellinger-UCB reaches the theoretical lower bound. We also show that the Hellinger-UCB has a solid statistical interpretation. We show that Hellinger-UCB is effective in finite time horizons with numerical experiments between Hellinger-UCB and other variants of the UCB algorithm. As a real-world example, we apply the Hellinger-UCB algorithm to solve the cold-start problem for a content recommender system of a financial app. With reasonable assumption, the Hellinger-UCB algorithm has a convenient but important lower latency feature. The online experiment also illustrates that the Hellinger-UCB outperforms both KL-UCB and UCB1 in the sense of a higher click-through rate (CTR).</description>

      <title>Lighter, Better, Faster Multi-Source Domain Adaptation with Gaussian Mixture Models and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), a task in transfer learning where one adapts multiple heterogeneous, labeled source probability measures towards a different, unlabeled target measure. We propose a novel framework for MSDA, based on Optimal Transport (OT) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our framework has two key advantages. First, OT between GMMs can be solved efficiently via linear programming. Second, it provides a convenient model for supervised learning, especially classification, as components in the GMM can be associated with existing classes. Based on the GMM-OT problem, we propose a novel technique for calculating barycenters of GMMs. Based on this novel algorithm, we propose two new strategies for MSDA: GMM-WBT and GMM-DaDiL. We empirically evaluate our proposed methods on four benchmarks in image classification and fault diagnosis, showing that we improve over the prior art while being faster and involving fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Relative Validity Indices for Comparing Clustering Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative Validity Indices (RVIs) such as the Silhouette Width Criterion, Calinski-Harabasz and Davie's Bouldin indices are the most popular tools for evaluating and optimising applications of clustering. Their ability to rank collections of candidate partitions has been used to guide the selection of the number of clusters, and to compare partitions from different clustering algorithms. Beyond these more conventional tasks, many examples can be found in the literature where RVIs have been used to compare and select other aspects of clustering approaches such as data normalisation procedures, data representation methods, and distance measures. The authors are not aware of any studies that have attempted to establish the suitability of RVIs for such comparisons. Moreover, given the impact of these aspects on pairwise similarities, it is not even immediately obvious how RVIs should be implemented when comparing these aspects. In this study, we conducted experiments with seven common RVIs on over 2.7 million clustering partitions for both synthetic and real-world datasets, encompassing feature-vector and time-series data. Our findings suggest that RVIs are not well-suited to these unconventional tasks, and that conclusions drawn from such applications may be misleading. It is recommended that normalisation procedures, representation methods, and distance measures instead be selected using external validation on high quality labelled datasets or carefully designed outcome-oriented objective criteria, both of which should be informed by relevant domain knowledge and clustering aims.</description>

      <title>How Deep Networks Learn Sparse and Hierarchical Data: the Sparse Random Hierarchy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what makes high-dimensional data learnable is a fundamental question in machine learning. On the one hand, it is believed that the success of deep learning lies in its ability to build a hierarchy of representations that become increasingly more abstract with depth, going from simple features like edges to more complex concepts. On the other hand, learning to be insensitive to invariances of the task, such as smooth transformations for image datasets, has been argued to be important for deep networks and it strongly correlates with their performance. In this work, we aim to explain this correlation and unify these two viewpoints. We show that by introducing sparsity to generative hierarchical models of data, the task acquires insensitivity to spatial transformations that are discrete versions of smooth transformations. In particular, we introduce the Sparse Random Hierarchy Model (SRHM), where we observe and rationalize that a hierarchical representation mirroring the hierarchical model is learnt precisely when such insensitivity is learnt, thereby explaining the strong correlation between the latter and performance. Moreover, we quantify how the sample complexity of CNNs learning the SRHM depends on both the sparsity and hierarchical structure of the task.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum simulation: a case study for understanding warm starts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real and imaginary time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training.</description>

      <title>Node Similarities under Random Projections: Limits and Pathological Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random Projections have been widely used to generate embeddings for various graph tasks due to their computational efficiency. The majority of applications have been justified through the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. In this paper, we take a step further and investigate how well dot product and cosine similarity are preserved by Random Projections. Our analysis provides new theoretical results, identifies pathological cases, and tests them with numerical experiments. We find that, for nodes of lower or higher degrees, the method produces especially unreliable embeddings for the dot product, regardless of whether the adjacency or the (normalized version) transition is used. With respect to the statistical noise introduced by Random Projections, we show that cosine similarity produces remarkably more precise approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the field of semi-supervised Fr\'echet regression, driven by the significant costs associated with obtaining non-Euclidean labels. Methodologically, we propose two novel methods: semi-supervised NW Fr\'echet regression and semi-supervised kNN Fr\'echet regression, both based on graph distance acquired from all feature instances. These methods extend the scope of existing semi-supervised Euclidean regression methods. We establish their convergence rates with limited labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data, taking into account the low-dimensional manifold structure of the feature space. Through comprehensive simulations across diverse settings and applications to real data, we demonstrate the superior performance of our methods over their supervised counterparts. This study addresses existing research gaps and paves the way for further exploration and advancements in the field of semi-supervised Fr\'echet regression.</description>

      <title>Analytical Approximation of the ELBO Gradient in the Context of the Clutter Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an analytical solution for approximating the gradient of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) in variational inference problems where the statistical model is a Bayesian network consisting of observations drawn from a mixture of a Gaussian distribution embedded in unrelated clutter, known as the clutter problem. The method employs the reparameterization trick to move the gradient operator inside the expectation and relies on the assumption that, because the likelihood factorizes over the observed data, the variational distribution is generally more compactly supported than the Gaussian distribution in the likelihood factors. This allows efficient local approximation of the individual likelihood factors, which leads to an analytical solution for the integral defining the gradient expectation. We integrate the proposed gradient approximation as the expectation step in an EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm for maximizing ELBO and test against classical deterministic approaches in Bayesian inference, such as the Laplace approximation, Expectation Propagation and Mean-Field Variational Inference. The proposed method demonstrates good accuracy and rate of convergence together with linear computational complexity.</description>

      <title>HiGraphDTI: Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a crucial role in pharmaceutical development. The deep learning model achieves more accurate results in DTI prediction due to its ability to extract robust and expressive features from drug and target chemical structures. However, existing deep learning methods typically generate drug features via aggregating molecular atom representations, ignoring the chemical properties carried by motifs, i.e., substructures of the molecular graph. The atom-drug double-level molecular representation learning can not fully exploit structure information and fails to interpret the DTI mechanism from the motif perspective. In addition, sequential model-based target feature extraction either fuses limited contextual information or requires expensive computational resources. To tackle the above issues, we propose a hierarchical graph representation learning-based DTI prediction method (HiGraphDTI). Specifically, HiGraphDTI learns hierarchical drug representations from triple-level molecular graphs to thoroughly exploit chemical information embedded in atoms, motifs, and molecules. Then, an attentional feature fusion module incorporates information from different receptive fields to extract expressive target features.Last, the hierarchical attention mechanism identifies crucial molecular segments, which offers complementary views for interpreting interaction mechanisms. The experiment results not only demonstrate the superiority of HiGraphDTI to the state-of-the-art methods, but also confirm the practical ability of our model in interaction interpretation and new DTI discovery.</description>

      <title>Randomized Exploration in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study on provably efficient randomized exploration in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We propose a unified algorithm framework for randomized exploration in parallel Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and two Thompson Sampling (TS)-type algorithms, CoopTS-PHE and CoopTS-LMC, incorporating the perturbed-history exploration (PHE) strategy and the Langevin Monte Carlo exploration (LMC) strategy respectively, which are flexible in design and easy to implement in practice. For a special class of parallel MDPs where the transition is (approximately) linear, we theoretically prove that both CoopTS-PHE and CoopTS-LMC achieve a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}H^2\sqrt{MK})$ regret bound with communication complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dHM^2)$, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the horizon length, $M$ is the number of agents, and $K$ is the number of episodes. This is the first theoretical result for randomized exploration in cooperative MARL. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple parallel RL environments, including a deep exploration problem (\textit{i.e.,} $N$-chain), a video game, and a real-world problem in energy systems. Our experimental results support that our framework can achieve better performance, even under conditions of misspecified transition models. Additionally, we establish a connection between our unified framework and the practical application of federated learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the geometry of binary hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a computational scheme in which data are encoded using high-dimensional binary vectors. We establish a result about the similarity structure induced by the HDC binding operator and show that the Laplace kernel naturally arises in this setting, motivating our new encoding method Laplace-HDC, which improves upon previous methods. We describe how our results indicate limitations of binary HDC in encoding spatial information from images and discuss potential solutions, including using Haar convolutional features and the definition of a translation-equivariant HDC encoding. Several numerical experiments highlighting the improved accuracy of Laplace-HDC in contrast to alternative methods are presented. We also numerically study other aspects of the proposed framework such as robustness and the underlying translation-equivariant encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an optimization algorithm for Variational Inference (VI) in complex models. Our approach relies on natural gradient updates where the variational space is a Riemann manifold. We develop an efficient algorithm for Gaussian Variational Inference whose updates satisfy the positive definite constraint on the variational covariance matrix. Our Manifold Gaussian Variational Bayes on the Precision matrix (MGVBP) solution provides simple update rules, is straightforward to implement, and the use of the precision matrix parametrization has a significant computational advantage. Due to its black-box nature, MGVBP stands as a ready-to-use solution for VI in complex models. Over five datasets, we empirically validate our feasible approach on different statistical and econometric models, discussing its performance with respect to baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dealing with imbalanced classification data, reweighting the loss function is a standard procedure allowing to equilibrate between the true positive and true negative rates within the risk measure. Despite significant theoretical work in this area, existing results do not adequately address a main challenge within the imbalanced classification framework, which is the negligible size of one class in relation to the full sample size and the need to rescale the risk function by a probability tending to zero. To address this gap, we present two novel contributions in the setting where the rare class probability approaches zero: (1) a non asymptotic fast rate probability bound for constrained balanced empirical risk minimization, and (2) a consistent upper bound for balanced nearest neighbors estimates. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of the benefits of class-weighting in realistic settings, opening new avenues for further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Aleatoric and Epistemic Discrimination: Fundamental Limits of Fairness Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models can underperform on certain population groups due to choices made during model development and bias inherent in the data. We categorize sources of discrimination in the ML pipeline into two classes: aleatoric discrimination, which is inherent in the data distribution, and epistemic discrimination, which is due to decisions made during model development. We quantify aleatoric discrimination by determining the performance limits of a model under fairness constraints, assuming perfect knowledge of the data distribution. We demonstrate how to characterize aleatoric discrimination by applying Blackwell's results on comparing statistical experiments. We then quantify epistemic discrimination as the gap between a model's accuracy when fairness constraints are applied and the limit posed by aleatoric discrimination. We apply this approach to benchmark existing fairness interventions and investigate fairness risks in data with missing values. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art fairness interventions are effective at removing epistemic discrimination on standard (overused) tabular datasets. However, when data has missing values, there is still significant room for improvement in handling aleatoric discrimination.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Optimal Control with Performance Guarantees for Unknown Systems with Latent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As control engineering methods are applied to increasingly complex systems, data-driven approaches for system identification appear as a promising alternative to physics-based modeling. While the Bayesian approaches prevalent for safety-critical applications usually rely on the availability of state measurements, the states of a complex system are often not directly measurable. It may then be necessary to jointly estimate the dynamics and the latent state, making the quantification of uncertainties and the design of controllers with formal performance guarantees considerably more challenging. This paper proposes a novel method for the computation of an optimal input trajectory for unknown nonlinear systems with latent states based on a combination of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and scenario theory. Probabilistic performance guarantees are derived for the resulting input trajectory, and an approach to validate the performance of arbitrary control laws is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>The extended Ville's inequality for nonintegrable nonnegative supermartingales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the initial work by Robbins, we rigorously present an extended theory of nonnegative supermartingales, requiring neither integrability nor finiteness. In particular, we derive a key maximal inequality foreshadowed by Robbins, which we call the extended Ville's inequality, that strengthens the classical Ville's inequality (for integrable nonnegative supermartingales), and also applies to our nonintegrable setting. We derive an extension of the method of mixtures, which applies to $\sigma$-finite mixtures of our extended nonnegative supermartingales. We present some implications of our theory for sequential statistics, such as the use of improper mixtures (priors) in deriving nonparametric confidence sequences and (extended) e-processes.</description>

      <title>Universal Online Learning with Gradient Variations: A Multi-layer Online Ensemble Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an online convex optimization approach with two different levels of adaptivity. On a higher level, our approach is agnostic to the unknown types and curvatures of the online functions, while at a lower level, it can exploit the unknown niceness of the environments and attain problem-dependent guarantees. Specifically, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log V_T)$, $\mathcal{O}(d \log V_T)$ and $\hat{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{V_T})$ regret bounds for strongly convex, exp-concave and convex loss functions, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension, $V_T$ denotes problem-dependent gradient variations and the $\hat{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$-notation omits $\log V_T$ factors. Our result not only safeguards the worst-case guarantees but also directly implies the small-loss bounds in analysis. Moreover, when applied to adversarial/stochastic convex optimization and game theory problems, our result enhances the existing universal guarantees. Our approach is based on a multi-layer online ensemble framework incorporating novel ingredients, including a carefully designed optimism for unifying diverse function types and cascaded corrections for algorithmic stability. Notably, despite its multi-layer structure, our algorithm necessitates only one gradient query per round, making it favorable when the gradient evaluation is time-consuming. This is facilitated by a novel regret decomposition equipped with carefully designed surrogate losses.</description>

      <title>Statistical Complexity of Quantum Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant activity on the problem of using data for the purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing classical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning, quantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating the data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure satisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side information such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of quantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data complexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about quantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine learning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss simultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we provide extensive background material on classical results from statistical learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states. Throughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide extensive pointers to the literature.</description>

      <title>Mori-Zwanzig latent space Koopman closure for nonlinear autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator presents an attractive approach to achieve global linearization of nonlinear systems, making it a valuable method for simplifying the understanding of complex dynamics. While data-driven methodologies have exhibited promise in approximating finite Koopman operators, they grapple with various challenges, such as the judicious selection of observables, dimensionality reduction, and the ability to predict complex system behaviors accurately. This study presents a novel approach termed Mori-Zwanzig autoencoder (MZ-AE) to robustly approximate the Koopman operator in low-dimensional spaces. The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder to extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman subspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields a closed representation of dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear autoencoder, thereby enhancing the precision and stability of the Koopman operator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's ability to capture regime transitions in the flow around a cylinder. It also provides a low dimensional approximation for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky with promising short-term predictability and robust long-term statistical performance. By bridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the mathematical foundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for improved understanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Frequentist Guarantees of Distributed (Non)-Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to analyze large, decentralized datasets, distributed Bayesian inference has become a critical research area across multiple fields, including statistics, electrical engineering, and economics. This paper establishes Frequentist properties, such as posterior consistency, asymptotic normality, and posterior contraction rates, for the distributed (non-)Bayes Inference problem among agents connected via a communication network. Our results show that, under appropriate assumptions on the communication graph, distributed Bayesian inference retains parametric efficiency while enhancing robustness in uncertainty quantification. We also explore the trade-off between statistical efficiency and communication efficiency by examining how the design and size of the communication graph impact the posterior contraction rate. Furthermore, We extend our analysis to time-varying graphs and apply our results to exponential family models, distributed logistic regression, and decentralized detection models.</description>

      <title>Causal Machine Learning for Moderation Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is valuable for any decision maker to know the impact of decisions (treatments) on average and for subgroups. The causal machine learning literature has recently provided tools for estimating group average treatment effects (GATE) to understand treatment heterogeneity better. This paper addresses the challenge of interpreting such differences in treatment effects between groups while accounting for variations in other covariates. We propose a new parameter, the balanced group average treatment effect (BGATE), which measures a GATE with a specific distribution of a priori-determined covariates. By taking the difference of two BGATEs, we can analyse heterogeneity more meaningfully than by comparing two GATEs. The estimation strategy for this parameter is based on double/debiased machine learning for discrete treatments in an unconfoundedness setting, and the estimator is shown to be $\sqrt{N}$-consistent and asymptotically normal under standard conditions. Adding additional identifying assumptions allows specific balanced differences in treatment effects between groups to be interpreted causally, leading to the causal balanced group average treatment effect. We explore the finite sample properties in a small-scale simulation study and demonstrate the usefulness of these parameters in an empirical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting consistent statistics between relevant free-energy minima of a molecular system is essential for physics, chemistry and biology. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can aid in this task but are computationally expensive, especially for systems that require quantum accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we develop an approach combining enhanced sampling with deep generative models and active learning of a machine learning potential (MLP). We introduce an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that enables the training of one Normalizing Flow (NF) and one MLP per state, achieving rapid convergence towards the Boltzmann distribution. Leveraging the trained NF and MLP models, we compute thermodynamic observables such as free-energy differences or optical spectra. We apply this method to study the isomerization of an ultrasmall silver nanocluster, belonging to a set of systems with diverse applications in the fields of medicine and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Ensemble Belief Propagation for Efficient Inference in High-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient inference in high-dimensional models remains a central challenge in machine learning. This paper introduces the Gaussian Ensemble Belief Propagation (GEnBP) algorithm, a fusion of the Ensemble Kalman filter and Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) methods. GEnBP updates ensembles by passing low-rank local messages in a graphical model structure. This combination inherits favourable qualities from each method. Ensemble techniques allow GEnBP to handle high-dimensional states, parameters and intricate, noisy, black-box generation processes. The use of local messages in a graphical model structure ensures that the approach is suited to distributed computing and can efficiently handle complex dependence structures. GEnBP is particularly advantageous when the ensemble size is considerably smaller than the inference dimension. This scenario often arises in fields such as spatiotemporal modelling, image processing and physical model inversion. GEnBP can be applied to general problem structures, including jointly learning system parameters, observation parameters, and latent state variables.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the echo state property in quantum reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian inference for the generalized linear mixed model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is a popular statistical approach for handling correlated data, and is used extensively in applications areas where big data is common, including biomedical data settings. The focus of this paper is scalable statistical inference for the GLMM, where we define statistical inference as: (i) estimation of population parameters, and (ii) evaluation of scientific hypotheses in the presence of uncertainty. Artificial intelligence (AI) learning algorithms excel at scalable statistical estimation, but rarely include uncertainty quantification. In contrast, Bayesian inference provides full statistical inference, since uncertainty quantification results automatically from the posterior distribution. Unfortunately, Bayesian inference algorithms, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), become computationally intractable in big data settings. In this paper, we introduce a statistical inference algorithm at the intersection of AI and Bayesian inference, that leverages the scalability of modern AI algorithms with guaranteed uncertainty quantification that accompanies Bayesian inference. Our algorithm is an extension of stochastic gradient MCMC with novel contributions that address the treatment of correlated data (i.e., intractable marginal likelihood) and proper posterior variance estimation. Through theoretical and empirical results we establish our algorithm's statistical inference properties, and apply the method in a large electronic health records database.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of research in computational psycholinguistics has concentrated on the processing of words. This study introduces innovative methods for computing sentence-level metrics using multilingual large language models. The metrics developed sentence surprisal and sentence relevance and then are tested and compared to validate whether they can predict how humans comprehend sentences as a whole across languages. These metrics offer significant interpretability and achieve high accuracy in predicting human sentence reading speeds. Our results indicate that these computational sentence-level metrics are exceptionally effective at predicting and elucidating the processing difficulties encountered by readers in comprehending sentences as a whole across a variety of languages. Their impressive performance and generalization capabilities provide a promising avenue for future research in integrating LLMs and cognitive science.</description>

      <title>Rate-Optimal Non-Asymptotics for the Quadratic Prediction Error Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quadratic prediction error method -- i.e., nonlinear least squares -- for a class of time-varying parametric predictor models satisfying a certain identifiability condition. While this method is known to asymptotically achieve the optimal rate for a wide range of problems, there have been no non-asymptotic results matching these optimal rates outside of a select few, typically linear, model classes. By leveraging modern tools from learning with dependent data, we provide the first rate-optimal non-asymptotic analysis of this method for our more general setting of nonlinearly parametrized model classes. Moreover, we show that our results can be applied to a particular class of identifiable AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, resulting in the first optimal non-asymptotic rates for identification of ARMA models.</description>
