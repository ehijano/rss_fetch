      <title>Shape space as a conceptual space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of shape space was introduced in the second half of the 20th Century as a useful analytical tool for tackling problems related to the intrinsic spatial configuration of material systems. In recent years, the geometrical properties of shape spaces have been investigated and exploited to construct a totally relational description of physics (classical, relativistic, and quantum). The main aim of this relational framework - originally championed by Julian Barbour and Bruno Bertotti - is to cast the dynamical description of material systems in dimensionless and scale-invariant terms only. As such, the Barbour-Bertotti approach to dynamics represents the technical implementation of the famous Leibnizian arguments against the reality of space and time as genuine substances. The question then arises about the status of shape space itself in this picture: Is it an actual physical space in which the fundamental relational dynamics unfolds, or is it just a useful mathematical construction? The present paper argues for the latter answer and, in doing so, explores the possibility that shape space is a peculiar case of a conceptual space.</description>

      <title>300th anniversary of the birth of Father Eliseo della Concezione: the scientific contribution in the Royal Academy of Studies of Palermo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2025 marks the 300th birthday of Father Eliseo della Concezione, professor of Experimental Physics at the Royal Academy of Studies of Palermo. To celebrate this anniversary, the Physics and Chemistry Library of the University Library System and the Department of Physics and Chemistry - Emilio Segre' have organized several cultural activities. In the article, after a brief biographical description of Father Eliseo della Concezione, we will present the activities carried out and discuss the historical and educational aspects of Father Eliseo's work carried out during his stay at the Royal Academy of Palermo at the end of 18th century.</description>

      <title>Einstein, Free Creations, and His Worldly Cloister</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09530v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines "Free Creations of the Human Mind: The Worlds of Albert Einstein" by Diana Kormos Buchwald and Michael D. Gordin. The authors seek to dispel the long-standing myths of Einstein as the "lone genius" of Bern and the "stubborn sage" of Princeton, drawing on newly uncovered archival materials to illuminate his intellectual networks and collaborative engagements. By exploring the authors' reasoning, this paper engages with their interpretations, highlighting the strengths of their archival revelations and areas where alternative perspectives may enrich the understanding of Einstein's intellectual development.</description>
