      <title>Unification of Gravity and Standard Model: Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a unified (quantum) description by the gauge principle of gravity and Standard Model (SM), that extends the Dirac-Born-Infeld action to the SM and Weyl geometry in $d$ dimensions, hereafter called Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action (WDBI). This action is a general gauge theory of SM and Weyl group (of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry), in the Weyl gauge covariant (metric) formulation of Weyl geometry. The theory is SM and Weyl gauge invariant in arbitrary $d$ dimensions, hence there is no Weyl anomaly. The action has the unique elegant feature, not present in other gauge theories or even in string theory, that it is mathematically well-defined in $d$ dimensions, with no need to introduce a UV regulator (scale or field). The WDBI action actually {\it predicts} that gravity, through (Weyl covariant) space-time curvature, acts as UV regulator of both SM and gravity in $d=4$. A series expansion of the WDBI action (in dimensionless couplings) recovers in the leading order the Weyl gauge invariant action of SM and Weyl (gauge theory of) quadratic gravity. The SM and Einstein-Hilbert gravity are recovered in the Stueckelberg broken phase of Weyl gauge symmetry, which also restores Riemannian geometry below Planck scale. Sub-leading orders are suppressed by powers of (dimensionless) gravitational coupling ($\xi$) of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Addressing Local Realism through Bell Tests at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most notable aspects of quantum systems is that their components can exhibit correlations much stronger than those allowed by classical physics. Two examples of quantum correlations are quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality, but generally there is a hierarchy of many types of quantum correlations. Among these correlations, Bell nonlocality holds a special place because it plays a dual role in distinguishing theories where local realism is a valid description. A Bell test, which is a test of local realism, typically needs to be augmented with assumptions to address possible loopholes in the experimental setup. In this work, we study Bell tests in experiments in which the detector reports the correct outcome with a specified probability. This mirrors the situation at high-energy colliders, where particle spins are not measured directly but inferred from the angular distributions of their decay products. We show that, in this setup, a test of local realism is not possible. Quantum correlations, however, are still present, measurable, and informative in high-energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on dark matter spikes through neutrino-dark matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino mass remains an open question in particle physics. One intriguing possibility is that neutrinos are massless in vacuum but acquire an effective refractive mass through interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM) during propagation. We investigate the capability of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to probe such refractive masses using the time-of-flight delays of neutrinos from a galactic core-collapse supernova. Our analysis shows that DUNE can set competitive bounds on the refractive neutrino mass, with sensitivity significantly enhanced if neutrinos traverse a DM density spike near the Galactic Center. In particular, we quantify how the presence of a spike modifies the projected limits, demonstrating that supernova neutrino observations at DUNE provide a powerful and novel avenue to test both the nature of neutrino masses and the distribution of DM in the innermost regions of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Observable Optimization for Precision Theory: Machine Learning Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practice of collider physics typically involves the marginalization of multi-dimensional collider data to uni-dimensional observables relevant for some physics task. In any cases, such as classification or anomaly detection, the observable can be arbitrarily complicated, such as the output of a neural network. However, for precision measurements, the observable must correspond to something computable systematically beyond the level of current simulation tools. In this work, we demonstrate that precision-theory-compatible observable space exploration can be systematized by using neural simulation-based inference techniques from machine learning. We illustrate this approach by exploring the space of marginalizations of the energy 3-point correlator to optimize sensitivity to the the top quark mass. We first learn the energy-weighted probability density from simulation, then search in the space of marginalizations for an optimal triangle shape. Although simulations and machine learning are used in the process of observable optimization, the output is an observable definition which can be then computed to high precision and compared directly to data without any memory of the computations which produced it. We find that the optimal marginalization is isosceles triangles on the sphere with a side ratio approximately $1:1:\sqrt{2}$ (i.e. right triangles) within the set of marginalizations we consider.</description>

      <title>Understanding large local CP violation in $B^\pm\to K^\pm\pi^+\pi^-$ using dispersive methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the universality of pion--pion ($\pi\pi$) final-state interactions at small invariant masses to understand their enhanced local CP violation in $B^\pm\to K^\pm\pi^+\pi^-$, using a dispersive approach. From a fit to the integrated CP-asymmetry data, we successfully predict the Dalitz-plot kinematic distribution of the asymmetry in the low-energy $\pi\pi$ region, including the large local CP violation recently observed by LHCb. An essential role is played by the contributions of isospin 2. This formalism, whose parameters have a physical meaning, can be adapted straightforwardly to other systems with CP violation enhanced by final-state interactions.</description>

      <title>Cooling of quark stars from perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of quark stars with and without a hadronic crust using an equation of state derived from perturbative QCD that incorporates the running of the strong coupling and the strange quark mass. Our analysis reveals that bare quark stars cool too rapidly to match the luminosity data, including those of the coldest observed isolated neutron stars, even when the uncertainty from the renormalization scale is taken into account. In contrast, configurations featuring a hadronic crust exhibit slower cooling and improved agreement with observational data. We also observe that the cooling band for bare quark stars narrows significantly after $t \sim 1$ year, whereas the configurations with a crust exhibit a larger uncertainty throughout their time evolution.</description>

      <title>On CP-violation and quark masses: reducing the number of free parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physically viable ansatz for quark mass matrices must satisfy certain constraints, like the constraint imposed by CP-violation. In this article we study a concrete example, by looking at some generic matrices with a nearly democratic texture, and the implications of the constraints imposed by CP-violation, specifically the Jarlskog invariant. This constraint reduces the number of parameters from six to five, implying that the six mass eigenvalues of the up-quarks and the down-quarks are interdependent, which in our approach is explicitly demonstrated.</description>

      <title>$D$-wave dimeson resonance interpretation to the $Z_c/Z_{cs}/Z_b$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the $S$-wave, $P$-wave, and $D$-wave $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{*}_{(s)}$/$B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{*}_{(s)}$ interactions by considering the lowest order contributions from the leading order (LO), next-to-leading order (NLO), and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) contact terms, respectively. After solving the corresponding Lippmann-Schwinger equation (LSE), we obtain the typical pole trajectory for the $S$-wave/$P$-wave/$D$-wave state. We adjust the $P$-wave low energy constant (LEC) and {accordingly obtain a $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^*/D^*\bar{D}$} resonance state that may correspond to the observed $G(3900)$, { and its $P$-wave $D^*\bar{D}^*$ and $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{*}$ partners are also predicted}. Then we proceed to adjust the $D$-wave LECs to looking for the $D$-wave $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}_{(s)}$/$B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ resonances. The satisfactory consistencies between our results { and the experimental resonance parameters} of $Z_c(3900)$/$Z_c(4020)$, $Z_b(10610)$/$Z_b(10650)$, and $Z_{cs}(4000)$/$Z_{cs}(4220)$ indicate that the $D$-wave resonance interpretation may provide a unified picture to understand these { isovector charmoniumlike states. Especially, the broad width features of $Z_{cs}(4000)$ and $Z_{cs}(4220)$ can be naturally reproduced by interpreting them as $D$-wave $D\bar{D}_s^*$ and $D^*\bar{D}_s^*$ resonances, respectively.</description>

      <title>The non-maximal symmetry breaking patterns in the supersymmetric $\widehat {\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}}(8)_{k_U =1}$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-maximal symmetry breaking patterns of ${\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}}(8) \to \mathfrak{g}_{531}/\mathfrak{g}_{351}$ allowed in a supersymmetric theory with the affine Lie algebra of $\widehat {\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}}(8)_{k_U=1}$, which was recently proposed to explain the three-generational standard model quark/lepton mass hierarchies as well as the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing pattern. Three gauge couplings are found to achieve the unification below the Planck scales, according to the unification relations determined by the affine Lie algebra at level of $1$. We also prove that a separate non-maximal symmetry breaking pattern of ${\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}}(8) \to \mathfrak{g}_{621}$ is unrealistic due to the additional massless vectorlike quarks in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Tetraquark states in the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform systematical investigations of heavy flavor tetraquark systems, including fully heavy $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ ($Q=b,c$), doubly heavy $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar q\bar q$ ($q=u,d$), and singly heavy $Qs\bar q\bar q$ tetraquark systems, within the framework of quark potential model. We employ the Gaussian expansion method and complex scaling method to solve the four-body Hamiltonian and identify bound and resonant states. We further calculate the root mean square radii to study the spatial configurations of tetraquarks. Our calculations reveal a rich spectrum of tetraquark states exhibiting diverse spatial configurations. In particular, we find good candidates for experimental states $X(6900)$, $X(7200)$, $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, and $T_{\bar c\bar s0}^*(2870)$. The fully charmed tetraquark resonances $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$ are compact teraquark states, while doubly charmed tetraquark bound state $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and charm-strange tetraquark resonance $T_{\bar c\bar s0}^*(2870)$ are meson molecules. Additionally, more tetraquark bound and resonant states are predicted and may be searched for in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Probes for String-Inspired Foam, Lorentz, and CPT Violations in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is such a basic principle in fundamental physics that it must be constantly tested and that any proposal of its violation and breakdown of CPT symmetry, that might characterize some approaches to quantum gravity, should be treated with care. In this review we examine, among other scenarios, such instances in supercritical~(Liouville) string theory, particularly in some brane models for ``quantum foam''. Using the phenomenological formalism introduced here, we analyze the observational hints of Lorentz violation in time-of-flight lags of cosmic photons and neutrinos which fit excellently stringy space-time foam scenarios. We further demonstrate how stringent constraints from other astrophysical data, including the recent first detections of multi-TeV events in $\gamma$-ray burst 221009A and PeV cosmic photons by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO), are satisfied in this context. Such models thus provide a unified framework for all currently observed phenomenologies of space-time symmetry breaking at Planckian scales.</description>

      <title>Search for doubly charged scalars in type-II seesaw mechanism through photon fusion at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small neutrino masses can be generated through the well-known seesaw mechanisms, among which the type-II scenario predicts a triplet scalar with doubly charged components. Except for the Drell-Yan production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the doubly charged scalars $\Delta^{\pm\pm}$ can also be produced through photon fusion along with ultraperipheral collision of protons, the outgoing protons from which can be detected by forward detectors at the LHC, providing a promising way to explore related new physics. We study the pair production through such processes at the 14 TeV LHC, focusing on the final states of $\mu^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{-}$ and $e^{+}e^{+}e^{-}e^{-}$ under normal (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) of the neutrino mass spectra, respectively. Promising sensitivity can be reached via our proposed search strategy. With luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$(100 fb$^{-1}$), $m_{\Delta}\sim430(520)$ GeV can be excluded at 95% C.L. under the NH via $\mu^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{-}$ states searching, while the mass bound can be extended to 730(880) GeV under the IH via $e^{+}e^{+}e^{-}e^{-}$ states. The exclusion limits on $m_{\Delta}$ can be improved up to 1 TeV and even higher with integrated luminosity accumulated to 3 ab$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Studying the in-medium $\phi$ meson spectrum through kaons in proton-nucleus reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the mass modifications of $\phi$ mesons in nuclei provides insights into the nature of strongly interacting matter. Specifically, $\phi$ meson mass shifts can be related to the in-medium modification of the strange quark condensate. Therefore, the partial restoration of chiral symmetry can be studied by observing the mass shifts through the decay channels $\phi \rightarrow e^+e^-$, and $\phi \rightarrow K^+K^-$. In this paper, we examine the possibility of observing the $\phi$ meson mass modifications of the $\phi$ mesons in 30 GeV proton-nucleus (C, Cu, Pb) collisions, to be studied at the J-PARC E88 experiment, through the kaonic decay channel, with the off-shell Budapest Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BuBUU) transport model. By applying different mean fields to the kaons, we examine their effects on the invariant mass spectra. Our simulations suggest that, although different mean fields for the kaons do affect the spectrum, there is a common observable effect primarily driven by the $\phi$ mass shift. However, due to the threshold associated with the two kaons, the signal we observe is quite different from the one expected in dilepton spectra. Therefore, to meaningfully constrain the mass shift, it will be useful to include both kaon and dilepton channels in the analysis of the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone boson phenomenology in Domain-Wall Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Domain-Wall Standard Model (DWSM), a five-dimensional framework in which all Standard Model (SM) particles are localized on a domain wall embedded in a non-compact extra spatial dimension. A distinctive feature of this setup is the emergence of a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson, arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the extra dimension due to the localization of SM chiral fermions. This NG boson couples via Yukawa interactions to SM fermions and their Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. We study the phenomenology of this NG boson and derive constraints from astrophysical processes (supernova cooling), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and collider searches for KK-mode fermions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The strongest limits arise from LHC data: we reinterpret existing mass bounds on squarks and sleptons in simplified supersymmetric models (assuming a massless lightest neutralino), as well as limits on exotic hadrons containing long-lived squarks or long-lived charged sleptons in the regime of extremely small Yukawa couplings. From this analysis, we obtain a conservative lower bound of 1 TeV on the masses of KK-mode quarks and charged leptons. Finally, we discuss the prospects for producing KK-mode fermions at future high-energy lepton colliders and outline strategies to distinguish their signatures from those of sfermions.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Extraction of the Pion-Nucleon Sigma Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pion-nucleon sigma term, characterizing the mass component of Higgs origin related to $u$ and $d$ quarks inside the nucleon, is investigated within relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory at leading two-loop order using the extended-on-mass-shell renormalization scheme. The two-loop representation of the sigma term is derived from the nucleon mass via the Feynman-Hellmann theorem and verified through a direct calculation of the forward isoscalar-scalar nucleon matrix element. We apply the derived chiral expression to extract the physical pion-nucleon sigma term by extrapolating $N_f=2+1$ lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) data at unphysical quark masses. We find that, at the two-loop level, the long-standing tension between lattice QCD and dispersive determinations can be naturally resolved, owing to the incorporation of intermediate $\pi\pi$ rescattering effects that begin to contribute at two-loop order. Our final result for the nucleon sigma term based on recent lattice QCD calculations is $\sigma_{\pi N}=55.9(2.5)$ MeV. It is compatible with the result of the Roy-Steiner equation analysis and thus provides a satisfactory resolution to the previous debate between lattice QCD and phenomenological determinations.</description>

      <title>The Masses of Fermions in the context of the Supersymmetric $SU(3)_{C}\times SU(3)_{L}\times U(1)_{N}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will study in details the masses spectrum of fermions of the Minimal Supersymmetric $SU(3)_{C}\times SU(3)_{L}\times U(1)_{N}$ Model. We will consider the case in which all the usual neutral scalars fields of this model obtain vacuum expectation values, in both case when we have $R$-parity conservation, respect the invariance of the quantum number, ${\cal F}\equiv B+L$, where $B$ is the baryon number while $L$ is the total lepton number, and the oppposite ones, it means $R$-parity violation. We will present numerical predictions for all the fermions of this model, we will show that all masses and mixing angles are in agreement with current experimental data.</description>

      <title>Exotic Heavy Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review our recent findings on the structure and properties of exotic heavy hadrons, focusing on two main topics. First, we examine the role of correlations driven by the short-range Coulomb-like color interaction in hidden heavy-flavor pentaquarks. We show how this framework consistently accounts for the observed pattern of $P_c$ and $P_{cs}$ states in the hidden-charm sector and enables predictions for the hidden-bottom sector, where experimental data are still lacking. The second topic explores the possibility of forming stable multihadron molecules from deeply bound two-hadron exotic states. In this context, a bound state of three $B$ mesons, denoted as $T_{bbb}$, with quantum numbers $(I)J^P = (1/2)2^-$, is presented. We find that the binding energy generally decreases as the number of hadrons increases, primarily due to effects of the Pauli principle and the appearance of new decay thresholds. Nonetheless, resonances may still arise in specific cases, depending on the internal thresholds of the system. Finally, we discuss how the decay width of an exotic multihadron resonance can offer valuable insights into its internal structure and underlying~dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized parton density in the $N \to \Delta$ transition from the large-$N_c$ light-cone wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor-polarized parton density is defined by the forward matrix element of a partonic operator in the $N \to \Delta$ transition. In this work, we investigate it by employing the large-$N_c$ light-cone wave function derived from the mean-field approach. The mean-field picture is based on low-energy effective dynamics in the large-$N_c$ limit, where the baryon wave function is formulated in the rest frame. By exploiting the covariance of the mean-field solution, we derive the corresponding large-$N_c$ light-cone wave function$\unicode{x2013}$decomposed unambiguously into $3Q$, $5Q$, $7Q$, and higher Fock components$\unicode{x2013}$in the infinite momentum frame. Evaluating the overlap of these wave functions, we derive an overlap representation of the tensor-polarized parton density in the $N \to \Delta$ transition and find that the leading contribution arises from the $5Q$ Fock sector. This indicates that the tensor-polarized parton density directly probes the genuine $5Q$ component and is governed by chiral dynamics. Our numerical analysis shows that the $N \to \Delta$ tensor-polarized parton density is suppressed, consistent with standard large-$N_c$ expectations. Finally, we establish connections among the tensor-polarized parton density, the generalized parton distribution $H_X$, and the energy-momentum tensor form factor $F_4$.</description>

      <title>Two-loop BSM contributions to Higgs pair production in the aligned THDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of the two-loop corrections controlled by the BSM Higgs couplings on the cross section for the production of a pair of SM-like Higgs bosons via gluon fusion in the aligned THDM. To this aim, we reassess the two-loop calculation of $\lambda_{hhh}$, we compute for the first time the two-loop corrections to $\lambda_{hhH}$, and we include the relevant corrections to the Higgs-gluon couplings and to the s-channel propagators entering the $gg \rightarrow hh$ amplitude. We discuss the numerical impact of the two-loop BSM contributions, first on the individual couplings and then on the prediction for the pair-production cross section, in two benchmark scenarios for the aligned THDM.</description>

      <title>The energy dependence of exclusive heavy vector meson photoproduction cross-sections and NLO BFKL evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy dependence of the cross-section for exclusive photoproduction of vector mesons $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$, using a solution to the next-to-leading order (NLO) Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equation. Our goal is to use BFKL evolution as a benchmark to provide evidence for the presence of non-linear QCD dynamics and signs for the onset of gluon saturation at highest center of mass energies. Our approach determines initial conditions for the proton from the Bartels-Golec Biernat-Kowalski (BGK) dipole model, and evolves the resulting unintegrated gluon distribution using NLO BFKL evolution. For the nucleus, initial conditions are generated through both the impact parameter dependent saturation model (IP-Sat), using a Wood-Saxon distribution and a $A^{1/3}$ scaling of the saturation scale of the original BGK model. We find that NLO BFKL evolution provides a very good description of the nuclear modification factor for $J/\psi$ production, if initial conditions are generated through a $A^{1/3}$ scaled BGK model, while the description fails, if initial conditions are created using the IP-Sat model.</description>

      <title>A string based model with Hagedorn temperature of $T_H\sim 300~$MeV describes the spectrum of mesons and glueballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the thermodynamics of a color-confined phase of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and pure gauge theory within a string-inspired model, corresponding to a physical spatial dimension, d = 3. We show that the physical mass spectrum of massive mesons--in both the strange and non-strange sectors separately--is reasonably well described and extended by the exponential mass spectrum of open strings, $\rho(m)$, characterized by a unique Hagedorn temperature, $T_H = \sqrt{3\sigma/2\pi}$, expressed by the string tension, $\sigma$. This $T_H$ is the value appropriate for d = 3 spatial dimensions, and is of order $T_H \sim 300~\rm MeV$ for typical values of the string tension. It is much larger than the values of $T_H$, which have been phenomenologically extracted \green{so far} to describe the meson spectrum. Glueball states in pure gauge theory, modeled by closed strings, exhibit a similarly large Hagedorn temperature, highlighting a universal feature of the exponential spectrum. We further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the equation of state at finite temperature and demonstrate that, in the confined phase, the string models agree with lattice QCD results. This lends further support to the recent interpretation of the QCD phase diagram that incorporates strings as relevant degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions and microscopic interactions in quasi-topological black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic geometry of four-dimensional quasi-topological black holes by computing the Ruppeiner scalar curvature R which serves as an empirical tool to describe the nature of interactions among black hole microstructures. In four dimensions, we write novel black hole solutions within the framework of generalized quasi-topological gravity, extended through a fundamental p-form field. Temperature, entropy, and thermodynamic volume are explicitly expressed using the extended first law. The nature of the interactions between the microstructure is then revealed by computing R, where positive curvature indicates repulsion dominant interactions and negative curvature indicates the dominance of attraction. Our approach uses divergences and sign changing nature of R to identify critical points and phase transitions. Further, our analysis reveals a notably streamlined thermodynamic behavior, a single zero-crossing of curvature R, marking a second-order phase transition and offering direct insight into the underlying microstructure interactions.</description>

      <title>Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of gravity interaction with matter at one-loop level of effective quantum field theory naturally sets the cut-off scale $\Lambda_E$ in a sub-Planckian region through incorporating the gauge coupling constant $\alpha(\Lambda_E)$ and the reduced Planckian mass $\tilde m_\text{pl}$ into relation $ \Lambda_E\sim \tilde m_\text{pl}\,\alpha(\Lambda_E)/(4\pi)$ numerically yielding $\Lambda_E\sim 10^{16}$ GeV. Such two scales are empirically inherent for an inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use methods of arithmetic geometry to solve the abelian local anomaly cancellation conditions for a four-dimensional gauge theory whose Lie algebra has a single $\mathfrak{u}_1$ summand, assuming that a solution exists. The resulting polynomial equations in the integer $\mathfrak{u}_1$ charges define a projective cubic hypersurface over the field of rational numbers. Generically, such a hypersurface is (by a theorem of Koll\'{a}r) a unirational variety, making it possible to find a finitely-many-to-one parametrization of all solutions (of which there are necessarily infinitely many). (Otherwise, such a hypersurface is either reducible or is a cone over an elliptic curve and all solutions can again be found in practice.) As an example, for the Standard Model Lie algebra with its three generations of quarks and leptons (or even with just a single generation and two $\mathfrak{su}_3 \oplus \mathfrak{su}_2$-singlet right-handed neutrinos), it follows that there are infinitely many anomaly-free possibilities for the $\mathfrak{u}_1$ hypercharges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inside dense neutrino gases, such as neutron star mergers or core-collapse supernovae, collective neutrino effects cause the transformation of one neutrino flavour into another. Due to strong neutrino self-interactions in these environments, there is prevalence of flavour swapping. Considering these environments to be isotropic and homogeneous, we present a study of collective neutrino oscillations by simulating such a system on a noisy quantum simulator (Qiskit AerSimulator) and a quantum processor (ibm\_brisbane). We model the effective Hamiltonian governing neutrino interactions and by applying the Trotter-Suzuki approximation, decompose it into a tractable form suitable for quantum circuit implementation of the time-evolution propagator. Encoding the neutrino state for a system of two- and three-neutrinos onto qubits, we compute the time evolution of the inversion probability relative to the initial product state. Furthermore, we present quantum circuits to evaluate the concurrence as a measure of entanglement between the neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical exploration of the relativistic-field-theory (RFT) formalism for three pions with all possible values of non-maximal isospin, $I_{\pi\pi\pi} = 2$, $1$ and $0$. Using the generic-isospin extension of the RFT formalism and applying our open-source Python library to implement the framework, we predict a range of three-pion energies for illustrative values of the two-to-two scattering amplitudes for various finite-volume irreps also with non-zero total momentum $\boldsymbol P$ in the finite-volume frame. The results restrict attention to the case of a vanishing intrinsic three-body interaction so that the spectra can be understood as a baseline. In future lattice QCD calculations, deviations from these values will be translated into evidence for intrinsic three-body effects in the various scattering channels.</description>

      <title>Revised QCD effects on the $Z\to b\bar{b}$ forward-backward asymmetry in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.00530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The forward-backward (FB) asymmetry of $b$ quarks in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the Z pole measured at LEP, $A_\text{FB}^{0,b} = 0.0992\pm0.0016$, remains today one of the electroweak precision observables with the largest disagreement (2.4$\sigma$) with respect to the Standard Model prediction, $(A_\text{FB}^{0,b})_{_\text{th}} = 0.1030 \pm 0.0002$. Beyond the dominant statistical uncertainties, QCD effects, such as $b$-quark showering and hadronization, are the leading sources of $A_\text{FB}^{0,b}$ systematic uncertainty, and have not been revised in the last twenty years. We reassess the QCD uncertainties of the eight original $A_\text{FB}^{0,b}$ LEP measurements, using modern parton shower PYTHIA 8 and VINCIA simulations with nine different implementations of soft and collinear radiation as well as of parton fragmentation. Our analysis, combined with NNLO massive $b$-quark corrections independently computed, indicates total propagated QCD uncertainties of $\sim$0.7\% and $\sim$0.3\% for the lepton- and jet-charge analyses, respectively, that are about a factor of two smaller than those of the original LEP results. Accounting for such updated QCD effects leads to a new $A_\text{FB}^{0,b} = 0.0995\pm0.0016$ average, with a data-theory tension slightly reduced from 2.4$\sigma$ to 2.2$\sigma$. Confirmation or resolution of this long-term discrepancy requires a new high-luminosity $e^+e^-$ collider collecting orders-of-magnitude more data at the Z pole to significantly reduce the dominant $A_\text{FB}^{0,b}$ statistical uncertainties, and to improve our understanding of $b$-quark showering and hadronization.</description>

      <title>Higgs Pair Production in the 2HDM: Impact of Loop Corrections to the Trilinear Higgs Couplings and Interference Effects on Experimental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results obtained at the LHC for constraining the trilinear Higgs self-coupling of the detected Higgs boson at about 125 GeV, $\lambda_{hhh}$, via the Higgs pair production process have significantly improved during the last years. We investigate the impact of potentially large higher-order corrections and interference effects on the comparison between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions for the pair production of the 125 GeV Higgs boson at the LHC. We use the theoretical framework of the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), containing besides the SM-like ${\cal CP}$-even Higgs boson $h$ a second ${\cal CP}$-even Higgs boson $H$, which we assume to be heavier, $m_H &gt; m_h$. We analyze in particular the invariant mass distribution of the two produced Higgs bosons and show that the loop corrections to the trilinear Higgs couplings $\lambda_{hhh}$ and $\lambda_{hhH}$ as well as interference contributions give rise to important effects both for the differential and the total cross section. We point out the implications for the experimental limits that can be obtained in the 2HDM for the case of the resonant production of the heavy Higgs boson $H$. We emphasize the importance of the inclusion of interference effects between resonant and non-resonant contributions in the experimental analysis for a reliable determination of exclusion bounds for a heavy resonance of an extended Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Schwinger pair production in spacetime fields: Moir\'e patterns, Aharonov-Bohm phases and Sturm-Liouville eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a worldline-instanton formalism to study the momentum spectrum of Schwinger pair production in spacetime fields with multiple stationary points. We show that the interference structure changes fundamentally when going from purely time-dependent to space-time-dependent fields. For example, it was known that two time-dependent pulses give interference if they are anti-parallel, i.e. $E_z(t)-E_z(t-\Delta t)$, but here we show that two spacetime pulses will typically give interference if they instead are parallel, i.e. $E_z(t,z)+E_z(t-\Delta t,z-\Delta z)$. We take into account the fact that the momenta of the electron, $p_z$, and of the positron, $p'_z$, are independent for $E_z(t,z)$ (it would be $p_z+p'_z=0$ for $E(t)$), and find a type of fields which give moir\'e patterns in the $p_z-p'_z$ plane. Depending on the separation of two pulses, we also find an Aharonov-Bohm phase. We also study complex momentum saddle points in order to obtain the integrated probability from the spectrum. Finally, we calculate an asymptotic expansion for the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville equation that corresponds to the saddle-point approximation of the worldline path integral, use that expansion to compute the product of eigenvalues, and compare with the result obtained with the Gelfand-Yaglom method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear trident, $e^{\scriptscriptstyle -}\to e^{\scriptscriptstyle -} e^{\scriptscriptstyle -} e^{\scriptscriptstyle +}$, in various electric background fields. This process has so far been studied for plane-wave backgrounds, using Volkov solutions. Here we first use WKB for trident in time-dependent electric fields, and then for fields which vary slowly in space. Then we show how to use worldline instantons for more general fields which depend on both time and space. For time-dependent fields the WKB approach is at least as simple to use as the worldline approach, but already the relatively modest step of including a slow spatial dependence makes the worldline approach much more efficient.</description>

      <title>Searching for single production of vectorlike quarks decaying into Wb at a future muon-proton collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the discovery potential for singly produced vectorlike quarks~(VLQs) $T$ ($Q=+2/3e$) and $Y$ ($Q=-4/3e$) decaying to $Wb$ at future $\mu p$ colliders with $\sqrt{s}=5.29$, 6.48, and 9.16 TeV, analyzing both leptonic and hadronic $W$ decay channels through detailed detector simulations. The hadronic channel demonstrates superior sensitivity, enabling $5\sigma$ discovery up to $m_T=3750$ GeV ($m_Y=4100$ GeV) at 9.16 TeV with 100 fb$^{-1}$, while exclusion limits reach $m_T=4500$ GeV ($g^*\geq0.06$) and $m_Y=4800$ GeV ($\kappa_Y\geq0.04$) - significantly beyond LHC capabilities. At 5.29 TeV, discovery regions cover $g^*\in[0.15,0.5]$ for $m_T\in[1500,2520]$ GeV and $\kappa_Y\in[0.12,0.5]$ for $m_Y\in[1700,2700]$ GeV, with exclusions extending to $m_T=2750$ GeV and $m_Y=3020$ GeV. These results, obtained within a simplified two-parameter framework ($m_{T/Y}$ and electroweak couplings $g^{\ast}$), establish $\mu p$ colliders as uniquely powerful tools for probing high-mass VLQ states, particularly in the boosted jet regime.</description>

Abstract: According to recent lore, it is difficult to explain the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background obtained by pulsar timing arrays with supercooled first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). We demonstrate that supercooled FOPTs in dark U(1)' models with a conformal dark sector easily explain the nHz signal at NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV dark matter via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance annihilation with CMB data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) annihilation via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance processes using current and future CMB data from Planck, FIRAS, and upcoming experiments such as LiteBIRD, CMB-S4, PRISTINE, and PIXIE. For $s$-wave annihilation, we provide updated limits for both $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\pi\pi$ channels, with the profile likelihood method yielding stronger constraints than the marginal posterior method. In the $p$-wave case, we comprehensively present a model-independent inequality for the 95\% upper limits from FIRAS, PRISTINE, and PIXIE, with future experiments expected to surpass current BBN limits. For resonance annihilation, we report -- for the first time -- the $95\%$ upper limits on the decay branching ratio of the mediator particle, when the resonance peaks during the recombination epoch. Overall, our study highlights the complementary strengths of $\mu$-distortion and CMB anisotropies in probing sub-GeV DM annihilation.</description>

      <title>Quark anomalous magnetic moments and neutral pseudoscalar meson dynamics with three-flavor NJL model in magnetized quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of quark anomalous magnetic moments (AMMs) on the mass spectra of neutral pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi$, $K$, $\eta$, $\eta^{'}$) under external magnetic fields, finite temperatures, and quark chemical potentials using the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. By incorporating AMMs at the quark level, we reveal that AMMs significantly alter the magnetic field dependence of constituent quark masses, inducing first-order phase transitions for light quarks at critical fields, while strange quarks exhibit nonmonotonic mass behavior. The inclusion of AMMs reshapes the QCD phase diagram, suppressing chiral transition temperatures, and the strong magnetic field shifts critical endpoints toward lower $\mu$ and higher $T$ without AMMs. The crossover phase transition without AMMs is replaced by a first-order transition with AMMs under strong fields. Moreover, the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) induced by the introduction of AMMs qualitatively aligns with the predictions of lattice QCD (LQCD) for the dependence of phase transition temperature on the magnetic field. For mesons, a larger AMM triggers abrupt mass collapses and enhances flavor spitting at zero $\mu$ and $T$ and accelerates chiral restoration for $K$ and $\eta$ mesons via thresholds tied to strange quark masses in finite $\mu$ and $T$. These findings underscore AMMs' critical role in reconciling effective model predictions with LQCD results, particularly in reproducing IMC and explaining phase transition dynamics.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to Higgs boson pair production and decay to the $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ final state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of next-to-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to Higgs boson pair production and the subsequent decay into $b\bar{b}\tau^+ \tau^-$. We adopt the narrow-width approximation to separate the production and decay contributions and employ the dipole subtraction method to address infrared divergences inherent in perturbative QCD corrections. After applying a set of typical experimental cuts, we show that NLO QCD corrections to the decay process induce a significant reduction of the fiducial cross section and reshape important kinematic distributions at the 13.6 TeV LHC, such as the invariant mass of the Higgs boson pair and the transverse momentum of the leading $b$-jet. We also investigate the dependence of the kinematic distributions on the Higgs self-coupling and provide the signal acceptance as a function of the Higgs self-coupling modifier with full QCD corrections.</description>

      <title>Different scenarios of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the interacting instanton liquid model via flavor symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a type of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\chi$SB) for various current quark masses using the interacting instanton liquid model. The type of D$\chi$SB is classified based on the sign of the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. We perform numerical simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model with the flavor SU(2) symmetric and (2+1)-flavor quarks. We find that the curvature is negative in the SU(2) case. This means the ordinary type of D$\chi$SB. In contrast, in the (2+1)-flavor case, a positive curvature is observed when the strange quark mass is as small as those of the up and down quarks. This suggests that the anomaly-driven type of D$\chi$SB can occur under the approximate flavor SU(3) symmetry. As the strange quark mass increases, the curvature gradually decreases and becomes negative when the strange quark mass is approximately three times larger than those of the light quarks. This difference can be understood in terms of the 't Hooft vertex which induces a six-quark interaction in the $N_f=3$ case and does a four-quark interaction in the $N_f=2$ case. Our results might indicate that the ratio between the strange and light quark masses plays a crucial role in understanding the microscopic relationship between D$\chi$SB and the anomaly effect.</description>

Abstract: We study the first power correction to the heavy electron form factor in QED and show that it factorizes as a derivative operator. We discuss the result in QED with no light fermions, where the first power correction can be written explicitly in terms of one-loop integrals and the anomalous magnetic moment. In the presence of light fermions, the heavy electron form factor admits a representation as a sum over matrix elements, each of which receives corrections from higher orders in perturbation theory. From this analysis, we are able to extract the next-to-leading power soft photon theorem in the limit of heavy fermion-initiated dijet events. This is a first step towards studying the heavy quark form factor in the non-abelian theory.</description>

Abstract: The hadron physics community has been actively debating the interpretation of so-called mechanical properties of hadrons. Non-relativistic quantum-mechanical systems like the hydrogen atom have been appealed to in these debates as analogies. Since such appeals are likely to continue, it is important to have Galilei-covariant expressions for matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, I obtain Galilei-covariant breakdowns of such matrix elements into mechanical form factors, with a special focus on spin-half states. I additionally study the spatial densities associated with these form factors, using the pilot wave interpretation to guide their breakdown into contributions from internal structure and from quantum-mechanical effects such as wave packet dispersion. For completeness, I also obtain non-relativistic Breit frame densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The world of particle physics was revolutionised in November 1974 by the discovery of the J/psi particle, the first particle to be identified as a quarkonium state composed of charm quarks and antiquarks. The charmonium interpretation of the J/psi was cemented by the subsequent observations of a spectrum of related c \bar c states, and finally by the discovery of charmed particles in 1976. The discovery of charmonium was followed in 1977 by the discovery of bottomonium mesons and particles containing bottom quarks. Toponium bound states of top quark and antiquarks were predicted to exist in principle but, following the discovery of the top quark in 1995, most physicists thought that its observation would have to wait for next-generation e^+ e^- collider. However, in the second half of 2024 the CMS Collaboration reported an excess of events near the threshold for \bar t t production at the LHC that is most plausibly interpreted as the lowest-lying toponium state. These are the personal recollections of an eyewitness who followed closely these 50 years of quarkonium discoveries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we numerically show that automatic Nelson-Barr models with new chiral fermions can simultaneously solve the strong CP problem and generate the observed baryon asymmetry via high-scale leptogenesis. In these models, all CP violation arises from a single spontaneous symmetry-breaking scale, linking the origin of quark and lepton CP phases. Using conservative assumptions and minimal dynamics, we identify a viable parameter window where successful leptogenesis occurs without spoiling the quality of the strong CP solution. Models with vector-like fermions face tension within this leptogenesis scenario. A key prediction is a correlation between the baryon asymmetry and the induced QCD vacuum angle shift. Remarkably, we find that the majority of the available parameter space is within reach of current and future nucleon EDM experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermions act as sources of spacetime torsion. However, this torsion is non-dynamical and can be eliminated using its equations of motion. The resulting theory features an effective four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. Generically this interaction is non-universal and violates parity. When neutrinos propagate through matter, they experience the effect of this geometrical interaction, which is similar to the MSW effect, but diagonal in the mass basis. Since this quartic interaction term varies linearly with matter density, its effect will be more prominent for atmospheric neutrinos specially for upward going atmospheric neutrinos. We investigate the effect of spacetime geometry on $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$ and $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ conversion probability and $\nu_\mu$ survival probability, by solving the Schr\"odinger equation using the {Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM)} density profile of the Earth. We also study the dependence of atmospheric neutrino oscillation probability on the CP phase angle in presence of this effect. We further provide a discussion of the MSW and parametric resonances in presence of the geometrical interaction.</description>

Abstract: The recent CMS observation of a near-threshold enhancement in top quark pair production provides the first experimental indication of a short-lived pseudoscalar $t\bar{t}$ bound state, commonly referred to as toponium. While most existing studies focus on toponium using perturbative QCD near threshold, baryonic configurations containing a single top quark -- singly topped baryons -- offer a complementary nonperturbative perspective. Notably, singly topped baryons are expected to exhibit a longer lifetime and a narrower decay width than toponium, since only one top quark decays rather than two. The heavy quark effective theory provides a natural and powerful framework for analyzing such systems, allowing the separation of heavy and light quark dynamics. In this work we employ heavy quark effective theory to investigate the internal structure of ground-state singly topped baryons. We construct their interpolating currents and analyze them using QCD sum rules. The resulting masses of the ground-state singly topped baryons are found to lie around 174 GeV, approximately $1.1$-$1.5$ GeV above the pole mass of the top quark.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Standard Model Mass Spectrum and Interactions In The Holomorphic Unified Field Theory"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2508.02747 a theory that unifies gravity and the Standard Model was proposed. It is finite, unitary, and accurately predicts all parameters of the Standard Model in terms of only two input parameters. Here I point out one prediction that was overlooked, namely that the photon acquires a mass at one loop due to the lack of gauge invariance in the nonlocal interaction vertices of the proposed model. In a second iteration, a red herring concerning Wick rotation is clarified, and the difficulties relating to gauge invariance in the theory are further spelled out. I point out that their model apparently has a domain wall problem.</description>

      <title>Bjorken initial energy density estimation in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV using ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bjorken initial energy density ($\epsilon_{B}$) has been estimated in different centrality classes in Xe-Xe collisions using Bjorken formula. Three different cases have been considered. In Case I, we have fixed the formation time ($\tau_{0}$) and varied the area of overlap region ($A_{overlap}$). In Case II, we have fixed both $\tau_{0}$ and $A_{overlap}$ and we have varied both $\tau_{0}$ and $A_{overlap}$ in Case III. We observed that the $\epsilon_{B}$ is first increasing and then decreasing while going from central to peripheral collisions in Case I whereas it is decreasing in Case II and III, as expected. The $\epsilon_{B}$ value for top central and mid central collisions in Case II and for all centrality classes in Case III are greater than 1 $GeV/(fm)^{3}$, indicating the possibility of QGP medium formation respectively. The $\epsilon_{B}$ results of the Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ and 5.02 TeV are compared. In Case II, it is observed that in the centrality class (0-5)%, the $\epsilon_{B}$ value in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV is 34.66% less than in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and 57.12% less than at 5.02 TeV. This may be interpreted as, the system size in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV is 34.66% smaller than in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and 57.12% smaller than at 5.02 TeV. Similarly in Case III in the centrality class (0-5)%, the $\epsilon_{B}$ value in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV is 3.22% more than in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and 32.18% less than at 5.02 TeV. This may be interpreted as, the system size in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV is 3.22% bigger than in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and 32.18% smaller than at 5.02 TeV. The results obtained in the Case III seems more suitable than Case II.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Test of Prerecombination New Physics: Measuring the Sound Horizon with Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Angular Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a broad class of cosmological models where spacetime is described by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, photons propagate along null geodesics, and their number is conserved, upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) observations can be combined with measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) angular scale to provide model-independent estimates of the sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. By focusing on the accuracy expected from forthcoming surveys such as LISA GW standard sirens and DESI or Euclid angular BAO measurements, we forecast a relative precision of $\sigma_{r_{\rm d}} /r_{\rm d} \sim 1.5\%$ within the redshift range $z \lesssim 1$. This approach will offer a unique model-independent measure of a fundamental scale characterizing the early universe, which is competitive with model-dependent values inferred within specific theoretical frameworks. These measurements can serve as a consistency test for $\Lambda$CDM, potentially clarifying the nature of the Hubble tension and confirming or ruling out new physics prior to recombination with a statistical significance of $\sim 4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>On the origin of mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, lattice simulations of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory revealed that rotating hot gluon matter in thermal equilibrium possesses a novel inhomogeneous phase consisting of the deconfinement phase located in the center region, which is spatially separated from the confinement phase in the periphery. This inhomogeneous two-phase structure is also expected to be produced by vorticity in quark-gluon plasma formed in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that its vortical properties are determined by two types of couplings of the angular velocity to the gluon fields: a linear coupling to the mechanical angular momentum of gluons and a quadratic ``magnetovortical'' coupling to a chromomagnetic component. We demonstrate numerically that the distinctive inhomogeneous structure of the vortical (quark-)gluon plasma is determined by the latter, while the former plays only a subleading role. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluonic action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also support our findings with Monte Carlo simulations of Yang-Mills plasma at the real-valued angular frequency, which take into account only the magnetic part of the action.</description>

      <title>A general approach to quantum integration of cross sections in high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present universal building blocks for the quantum integration of generic cross sections in high-energy physics. We make use of Fourier quantum Monte Carlo integration (MCI) as implemented in Quantinuum's quantum MCI engine to provide an extendable methodology for generating efficient circuits that can implement generic cross-section calculations, providing a quadratic speed-up in root mean-squared error convergence with respect to classical MCI. We focus on a concrete example of a $1 \to 3$ decay process to illustrate our work.</description>

      <title>Modelling Gaia photometry signals of dark halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of microlensing to show that observations of binary systems, such as those made by {\it Gaia}, combined with follow-up weak lensing measurements, can provide a means to probe halos of exotic matter, possibly clumped around compact objects such as black holes. This could potentially cover a broad range of physical scenarios - from dark matter mini-halos to black holes with bosonic configurations around them, known as hair. In a dark halo-regular star binary system, assuming that light can freely propagate through the halo of the exotic matter, the companion star will produce characteristic, sizable lensing signatures due to the lens's potential deviating from a point mass gravitational potential. The signature of the multiple images, the magnification and the light-curve could be the smoking gun of such a dark halo structure. We discuss how the precise observations of the {\it Gaia} survey offer an opportunity to search for new, yet undiscovered fundamental fields interacting gravitationally with baryons.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\Lambda$CDM: 5$\sigma$ Evidence for a Dynamical Dark Energy Late-Time Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been considerable debate regarding potential evidence for the dynamical nature of dark energy (DE), particularly in light of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements released by DESI survey. In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is independent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior best fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most up-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis reveals strong and statistically significant evidence for a quintessence-phantom transition across various data combinations. \textit{The strongest evidence is found for Planck+DESI+DESY5, with a significance exceeding $\sim$5$\sigma$ in favor of a quintessence-phantom transition at $z_{\dag} = 0.493^{+0.063}_{-0.081}$}. Beyond this redshift, the EoS remains within the phantom regime, while for $z &lt; z_{\dag}$, it favors the quintessence regime. Despite this strong indication, \textit{we find that such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension}</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations and Coexistence of Vortices and Antivortices in Generalized Abelian Higgs Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the Bogomol'nyi equations in generalized Abelian Higgs theories which allow the coexistence of vortices and antivortices over a compact Riemann surface or the full plane. In the compact surface situation, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution describing a system of coexisting vortices and antivortices. In the full-plane situation, we prove the existence of a unique solution representing an arbitrary distribution of vortices and antivortices and obtain sharp asymptotic behavior of the solution near infinity. These solutions carry quantized magnetic fluxes and energies explicitly expressed in terms of the numbers of vortices and antivortices topologically characterized by the first Chern and Thom classes.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of long period transients with space-based gravitational-wave interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of long period transients have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars or compact binaries remain viable. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704--37 -- some of these elusive radio transients could be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems under various scenarios and show that a few could be detectable for sufficiently large chirp masses. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <title>First direct search for light dark matter interactions in a transition-edge sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.</description>
