      <title>KKMCee: Multi-photon MC for lepton and quark pair production at lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the Monte Carlo event generator KKMCee for lepton and quark pair production in the high energy electron-positron annihilation process. We note that it is still the most sophisticated event generator for such processes. Its entire source code has been rewritten in C++. We have verified that the new version, KKMCee 5.00, reproduces the benchmarks of the older code in FORTRAN 77. We discuss a number of improvements in the MC algorithm and its interfaces.</description>

      <title>Advancing Tools for Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the benefit of modern simulation-based inference to constrain particle interactions at the LHC. We explore ways to incorporate known physics structures into likelihood estimation, specifically morphing-aware estimation and derivative learning. Technically, we introduce a new and more efficient smearing algorithm, illustrate how uncertainties can be approximated through repulsive ensembles, and show how equivariant networks can improve likelihood estimation. After illustrating these aspects for a toy model, we target di-boson production at the LHC and find that our improvements significantly increase numerical control and stability.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Running in the Bosonic SMEFT Using Functional Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next goalpost in precision calculations for physics beyond the Standard Model is determining the two-loop renormalization group (RG) equations in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We progress towards this goal by determining the RG equations for a simplified version of the SMEFT without any fermion fields. Our calculation relies on functional methods that are newly developed for multi-loop computations and adapted for the determination of RG equations here.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SO(10) Axion Model Without Quality Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invisible axion models that solve the strong CP problem via the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism typically have a quality problem that arises from quantum gravity effects which violate all global symmetries. These models therefore require extreme fine-tuning of parameters for consistency. We present a new solution to the quality problem in a unified $SO(10)\times U(1)_a$ gauge model, where $U(1)_a$ is an anomaly free axial gauge symmetry. PQ symmetry emerges as an accidental symmetry in this setup, which admits a PQ breaking scale as large as $4\times 10^{11}$ GeV, allowing for the axion to be the cosmological dark matter. We call this a hybrid axion model due to its unique feature that it interpolates between the popular KSVZ and DFSZ axion models. Its predictions for the experimentally measurable axion couplings to the nucleon and electron are distinct from those of the usual models, a feature that can be used to test it. Furthermore, the model has no domain wall problem and it provides a realistic and predictive framework for fermion masses and mixings.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Long-Ranged Interactions Between Dark Matter and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter's existence is known thanks to its gravitational interaction with Standard Model particles, but it remains unknown whether this is the only force present between them. While many searches for such new interactions with dark matter focus on short-range, contact-like interactions, it is also possible that there exist weak, long-ranged forces between dark matter and the Standard Model. In this work, we present two types of constraints on such new interactions. First, we consider constraints arising from the fact that such a force would also induce long range interactions between Standard Model particles themselves, as well as between dark matter particles themselves. Combining the constraints on these individual forces generally sets the strongest constraints available on new Standard Model-dark matter interactions. Second, we consider the possibility of constraining new long-ranged interactions between dark matter and the Standard Model using the effects of dynamical friction in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, especially Segue I. Such new interactions would accelerate the transfer of kinetic energy from stars to their surrounding dark matter, slowly reducing their orbits; the present-day stellar half-light radius of Segue I therefore allows us to exclude new forces which would have reduced stars' orbital radii below this scale by now.</description>

      <title>Searching for ultra-light dark matter through frequency modulation of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-light bosons, naturally appearing in well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model, can constitute all the dark matter. Models with particle mass close to the smallest phenomenologically allowed exhibit coherent field configurations at (sub)galactic scales, oscillating at a frequency corresponding to the fundamental mass of the dark matter particle. The gravitational field of these structures inherits the dark matter field's coherent oscillations, leaving an imprint on gravitational (and electromagnetic) waves sourced close to (or in) such overdensities. This happens via a heterodyning frequency modulation, which can later be decoded in a gravitational-wave detector. An analogous effect occurs in models with universal (conformal) couplings of ultra-light bosons with ordinary matter, generated by the direct interaction with the oscillating field. In this work, we explore this phenomenon in detail and assess the capability of near-future interferometers to probe ultra-light dark matter and its potential conformal couplings to matter. Using astrophysical population models, together with results from cosmological simulations, we find that the observation of gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars at the Galactic Centre with the Einstein Telescope/Cosmic Explorer would be particularly effective in constraining ultra-light dark matter.</description>

      <title>BBN Constraint on Heavy Neutrino Production and Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint on heavy neutrino that is a mixture of gauge singlet fermion and active neutrinos in the Standard Model. We work in the minimal model with only two parameters, the heavy neutrino mass $m_4$ and the mixing parameter $|U_{a4}|^2$, where $a=e$, $\mu$, or $\tau$ stands for the active neutrino flavor. We show that both the early universe production mechanism and decay products of the heavy neutrino are determined by $m_4$ and $|U_{a4}|^2$, with little room for further assumptions. This predictivity allows us to present a portrait of the entire BBN excluded parameter space. Our analysis includes various effects including temporary matter domination, energy injections in the form of pions, photons and light neutrinos. The BBN constraint is complementary to terrestrial search for heavy neutrinos (heavy neutral leptons) behind the origin of neutrino masses and portal to the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Formation of defects associated with both spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss formation of cosmic strings associated with a spontaneously broken approximate $U(1)$ symmetry by performing classical field-theoretical simulations. An original $U(1)$ symmetry is explicitly broken down to its subgroup $Z_N$ even before spontaneous breaking takes place. We estimate the ratio of explicit breaking to that of spontaneous breaking for which topological defects for $N=1$ and $N=2$ are formed. For $N=1$, a cosmic string attached to a single domain wall can be formed when the amount of the explicit breaking is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the spontaneous breaking. For $N=2$, no matter how large the explicit breaking is, domain walls are inevitably formed as long as the temperature of the Universe is high enough to restore $Z_2$ symmetry. In that case, cosmic strings are also inevitably formed as long as the amount of the explicit breaking is smaller than that of the spontaneous breaking.</description>

      <title>Transverse and spatial structure of light to heavy pseudoscalar mesons in light-cone quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the transverse and spatial structure of light ($\pi^+ (u\bar d)$, $K^+(u\bar s)$) and heavy ($\eta_c(c\bar c)$, $\eta_b (b\bar b)$, $B$ and $D$) pseudoscalar mesons using the light-cone quark model. The transverse structure of these particles have been studied using the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution (TMDs). The leading twist unpolarized $f_1(x, \mathbf{k}_\perp^2)$ TMD has been solved using the quark-quark correlator. We have predicted the average momenta carried by the quark and antiquark of the considered mesons. For a complete description of mesons, we have also computed the leading twist unpolarized $H(x,0,-t)$ generalized parton distribution (GPD). Further, electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs), along with gravitational form factors (GFFs) have been derived by taking the zeroth and first moments of the unpolarized GPD. These EMFFs are found to be compatible with available lattice simulation results. Further, we have also calculated the parton distribution functions (PDFs) for both the quarks and the antiquarks of these mesons. The PDF sum rule has also been verified.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Internal Pair Production -- A Novel Detection Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism, dark matter internal pair production (DIPP), to detect dark matter candidates at beam dump facilities. When energetic dark matter scatters in a material, it can create a lepton-antilepton pair by exchanging a virtual photon with the nucleus, similar to the neutrino trident process. We demonstrate this process for dark matter coupled to dark photons in experiments such as DarkQuest, SBND, and DUNE ND experiments. Since the pair-produced lepton-antilepton pair carries a large fraction of the center-of-mass energy and also has similar energy profiles, they can be clearly distinguished from backgrounds. We utilize the above features to show that DIPP is effective in probing various dark matter models, especially at DUNE ND and DarkQuest, by looking for electron-positron and muon-antimuon signatures. We also consider a scenario with dark sector couplings to quarks and muons only to show that DIPP can probe a wide range of dark matter models with various final states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden-charm strong decays of the spin-2 partner $X_2(4014)$ of the charmonium-like state $X(3872)$ have been studied in the framework of the covariant confined quark model. The exotic state $X_2$ has been interpreted as a four-quark state with molecular-type interpolating current. We have considered the decay widths of $X_2$ on the level of two-petal quark loops. The partial widths of the strong decays $X_2\!\to\!\omega \, J/\Psi$ and $X_2\!\to\!\rho^0 \, J/\Psi$ have been calculated and the related branching ratio has been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Jet Energy Loss in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we give a method to study the energy loss of jets in the medium using a variety of jet energy loss observables such as nuclear modification factor and transverse momentum asymmetry in dijets and $\gamma$-jets in heavy ion collisions. The energy loss of jets in the medium depends mainly on the size and the properties of medium viz. temperature and is a function of energy of the jets as predicted by various models. A Monte Carlo (MC) method is employed to generate the transverse momentum and path-lengths of the initial jets that undergo energy loss. Using different scenarios of energy loss, the transverse momentum and system size dependence of nuclear modification factors and different measures of dijet momentum imbalance at energies $sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV and $\gamma$-jet asymmetry at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ =2.76 TeV in Pb+Pb collisions are simulated. The results are compared with the measurements by ATLAS and CMS experiments as a function of transverse momentum and centrality. The study demonstrates how the system size and energy dependence of jet energy loss can be quantified using various experimental observables.</description>

Abstract: The decays of the Z boson and CP-even or CP-odd scalar bosons into quark-antiquark pairs have been calculated at NLO in the framework of Implicit Regularization (IReg) , which operates strictly in the physical dimension and complies with the BPHZ procedure. The presence of the {\gamma}5 matrix is dealt without the need of gauge symmetry restoring counterterms and the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg (KLN) theorem is verified. The results are compared to the ones obtained in the Dimensional Reduction scheme (DRed).</description>

      <title>Four-loop splitting functions in QCD -- The gluon-gluon case --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have computed the even-N moments N =&lt; 20 of the gluon-gluon splitting function P_{gg} at the fourth order of perturbative QCD via the renormalization of off-shell operator matrix elements. Our results, derived analytically for a general compact simple gauge group, agree with all results obtained for this function so far, in particular with the lowest five moments obtained via structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering. Using our new moments and all available endpoint constraints, we construct improved approximations for the four-loop P_{gg}(x) that should be sufficient for a wide range of collider-physics applications. The N^3LO contributions to the scale derivative of the gluon distribution, resulting from these and the corresponding quark-to-gluon splitting functions, amount to 1% or less at x &gt;~ 10^{-4} at a standard reference scale with alpha_s = 0.2.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Non-Leptonic Two-Body Decays of Charmed Mesons into Final States with $\eta'$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $D\rightarrow P\eta'$ decay amplitudes, where $P=K,\pi,\eta$, cannot be simply related to their $D\rightarrow P\eta$ counterparts with a single $\eta_0$--$\eta_8$ mixing angle. Proposing a novel, consistent treatment of $\eta_0$--$\eta_8$ mixing, we perform a global analysis of $D\rightarrow P\eta'$ decays employing SU(3)$_F$ symmetry including linear SU(3)$_F$ breaking. We find that the assumption of 30\% SU(3)$_F$ breaking is in slight tension ($2.5\sigma$) with the data when compared to a fit that allows for 50\% SU(3)$_F$ breaking, the latter giving a perfect description of the data. In order to allow for further scrutinization of SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects in the future, we give branching ratio predictions for all $D\rightarrow P\eta'$ modes. Our predictions deviate from the current data in case of the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\rightarrow K^+\eta')$ and $\mathcal{B}(D^+\rightarrow K^+\eta')$. Future more precise measurements of these channels are therefore highly important in order to clarify the quality of the SU(3)$_F$ expansion in nonleptonic $D\rightarrow P\eta'$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the quark masses are lighter than those in QCD, the standard lore is that a chiral transition of first order must emerge for three, light flavors. Recently, however, numerical simulations on the lattice suggest that the chiral transition is of second order in the chiral limit. Using an extended linear sigma model in the mean field approximation, we study the relation between terms which break the anomalous, $U(1)_A$ symmetry and the order of the chiral phase transition, especially how a chiral transition of second order can arise for three, massless flavors. We note that in an (unphysical) region of the "Columbia" phase diagram, when the strange quark mass is light and negative, corresponding to topological angle $\theta=\pi$, the $CP$ symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>Unusual portals to new exotics, the W-gluon portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore models where new light exotic states interact with the Standard Model through an asymmetric di-boson portal with one gluon and one W boson. We consider the complete set of effective operators up to dimension 6 which couple a single light exotic (LEX) state to at least one W boson and 1 gluon. Other Standard Model particles may also be present in the interactions. We discover that the W-gluon portal allows us to access a large array of exotic states in non-trivial representations of SU(3) and SU(2). We discuss new single production collider modes and phenomenological signatures for these light exotic states at LHC and e-p colliders.</description>

      <title>Speeding up the Universe with a generalised axion-like potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the Universe is one of the major challenges in cosmology today. In this paper, we present a new scalar field model corresponding to a generalised axion-like potential. In fact, this model can be framed as a quintessence model based on physically motivated considerations. This potential is capable of alleviating the coincidence problem through a tracking regime. We will as well prove that this potential allows for a late-time acceleration period induced by an effective cosmological constant, which is reached without fine-tuning the initial conditions of the scalar field. In our model, the generalised axion field fuels the late-time acceleration of the Universe rather than fuelling an early dark energy era. Additionally, we will show how the late-time transition to dark energy dominance could be favoured in this model, since the density parameter of the scalar field will rapidly grow in the late phase of the tracking regime.</description>

      <title>The Hypertriton Puzzle in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The yields of hadrons and light nuclei in relativistic collisions of heavy-nuclei at a center of mass energy of 2.6 TeV can be described remarkably well by a thermal distribution of an ideal gas of hadrons and light nuclei interacting only via the decay of resonances. Given the particularly small binding energy of hypertritons relative to the temperature describing the yields (about 156 MeV), one might naturally expect hypertrions to dissociate in medium, making the agreement of hypertriton yields with thermal predictions highly puzzling. The puzzle is compounded by the fact that small binding energy is associated with the large size of the hypertriton. This size is on a similar scale to the overall size of the fireball and much larger than the length scale over which temperatures in the fireball vary over phenomenologically relevant amounts. This paper quantifies the tension this effect causes and shows that it is sufficiently large to render the thermal model inconsistent: its natural assumptions are in conflict with its outputs. The possibility that hypertritons are formed at freeze out as compact objects, quark droplets, that subsequently evolve into hypertritons is considered as a way to resolve the puzzle. It is noted that beyond making the assumption that compact quark droplets form, additional detailed dynamical assumptions which have not been justified are needed to make the thermal model work. The issue of why, despite these issues, the hypertriton is well described by a simple statistical description at freeze out is unresolved. Resolving the hypertriton puzzle is important as it may clarify whether the phenomenological success of the simple thermal model for yields accurately reflects the simple picture of the underlying physics on which it is based.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants: from measurement to the universe, a window on gravitation and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental constants are a cornerstone of the physical laws. Any constant varying in space and/or time would signal a violation of local position invariance and be associated with a violation of the universality of free fall, and hence of the weak equivalence principle. It will reflect the existence of new degrees of freedom that couple to standard matter. Thus, testing for the stability of fundamental constants is of utmost importance for our understanding of gravity and for characterizing the domain of validity of General Relativity. Besides, it opens an independent window on dark matter and dark energy. As a consequence, thanks to the active development of experiments and of their accuracy, fundamental constants have become a key player in our search for physics beyond the standard model of and beyond General Relativity.
  This review details the roles of the fundamental constants in the laws of physics and in the construction of the International System of units. Then, the relations between constants, tests of the local position invariance and of the universality of free fall are exposed, as well as the construction of field theories that account for "varying constants". Then, the main experimental and observational constraints are described. It details the basics of each system, its dependence with respect to the primary parameters the variation of which can be constrained from observations, the known systematics effects and the most recent constraints. It also describes how these primary parameters can be related to the fundamental constants and the model-dependencies. Both time and space variation are considered. Given the huge increase of data and constraints, a general scheme to present experimental and observational results and to construct a collaborative data base that will be more efficient for the community and allow for better traceability, is proposed.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain will be highly sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from the Hagedorn Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We illustrate the main points behind the computation of the gravitational wave spectrum originated from a phase in the early universe where the energy density is dominated by highly excited fundamental string degrees of freedom - a Hagedorn phase. This phase is described using the Boltzmann equation approach to string thermodynamics, which we illustrate via a toy model which permits analytic computations for the evolution of perturbations. This window into the out-of-equilibrium regime allows us to compute equilibration rates and conclude that, in realistic scenarios, long, open strings dominate the ensemble, source gravitational waves and provide a succesful reheating. Furthermore, we compare the results against the Standard Model prediction for a gravitational wave background of thermal origin and conclude that the string prediction is significantly larger. This is one of the few cases in which a signal of stringy origin dominates over the field theory analogue. This work is based on arXiv:2310.11494 and arXiv:2408.13803 and is a contribution to the Proceedings of the 29th symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology (PASCOS 2024).</description>

      <title>Renormalons as Saddle Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instantons and renormalons play important roles at the interface between perturbative and non-perturbative quantum field theory. They are both associated with branch points in the Borel transform of asymptotic series, and as such can be detected in perturbation theory. However, while instantons are associated with non-perturbative saddle points of the path integral, renormalons have mostly been understood in terms of Feynman diagrams and the operator product expansion. We provide a non-perturbative path integral explanation of how both instantons and renormalons produce singularities in the Borel plane using representative finite-dimensional integrals. In particular, renormalons can be understood as saddle points of the 1-loop effective action, enabled by a crucial contribution from the quantum scale anomaly. These results enable an exploration of renormalons from the path integral and thereby provide a new way to probe connections between perturbative and non-perturbative physics in QCD and other theories.</description>

      <title>Relativistic spin hydrodynamics revisited with general rotation by entropy-current analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the canonical formulation of spin hydrodynamics for Dirac fermions with a general thermal vorticity. The orders of the general thermal vorticity and the corresponding spin variables are considered independently from those of the conventional hydrodynamic variables and their perturbative gradients. Assuming a totally antisymmetric spin current of Dirac fermions, the entropy-current analysis with a general spin potential indicates that the constitutive relations of the stress-energy tensor have to involve spin variables, particularly those linked to boost symmetry, to adhere to the entropy principle. In the presence of the degree of freedom associated with boost symmetry, we choose the constitutive relations of the canonical formulation to be connected to those of the phenomenological formulation through pseudogauge transformation. Subsequently, a linear-mode analysis is conducted using the resulting spin hydrodynamic equations. It is observed that the spin and hydrodynamic modes in this canonical formulation display different characteristics compared to those in the phenomenological formulation up to the second order of gradient.</description>

      <title>The light burden of memory: constraining primordial black holes with high-energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies point out that quantum effects, referred to as "memory burden", may slow down the evaporation of black holes. As a result, a population of light primordial black holes could potentially survive to the present day, thus contributing to the energy density of dark matter. In this work, we focus on light primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{9}~{\rm g}$ that, due to the memory burden effect, are currently evaporating, emitting high-energy particles, among which neutrinos, in the local Universe. Analyzing the latest IceCube data, we place novel constraints on the combined parameter space of primordial black holes and the memory burden effect. We also study the projected reach of future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND. We find that the neutrino observations are crucial to probe scenarios with highly-suppressed evaporation and light masses for primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist metastable domain walls of the flavor-singlet meson $\eta$ for the ${\rm U}(1)$ axial symmetry in two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC) in QCD at large baryon density. We show that, due to the coupling of $\eta$ to confined ${\rm SU}(2)$ gluons in the 2SC phase, the effective theory on the domain wall is described by the ${\rm SU}(2)_{-1}$ Chern-Simons theory, which is dual to the ${\rm U}(1)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory. This theory has a spin-1 droplet excitation that does not carry baryon number, which we identify as a vector meson. We also discuss the effective theories and baryonic droplet excitations on the domain walls of the flavor-singlet mesons in the superfluid phases of QCD at large isospin density and two-color QCD at large baryon density.</description>

      <title>Unified Origin of Curvature Perturbation and Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework that describes both the curvaton mechanism for generating primordial density fluctuations and the Affleck-Dine (AD) field for baryogenesis. By introducing a complex scalar field (AD field) carrying a baryon/lepton number and its potential consisting of quadratic and quartic terms with a small baryon/lepton-number-violating mass term, we investigate the evolution of the scalar field during the radiation-dominated era following inflation. We set the initial conditions such that the quartic term dominates the scalar potential, and the angular component of the AD field is non-zero. We focus on a scenario where the AD field decays early, ensuring that its energy density never dominates over that of radiation. We show that the radial component of the AD field can be identified with the curvaton to solely produce the Planck normalized scalar power spectrum while the evolution of the angular component is crucial for generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. Additionally, we find that the amplitude of scalar bispectrum $f_{NL}$ is positive, with an amplitude of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, which is consistent with the current Planck data and testable in future observations such as CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, LSS, and 21-cm experiments. In our estimation of the scalar power spectrum and bispectrum, we develop a novel analytical scheme for computing scalar fluctuations based on the $\delta N$ formalism, which allows us to deal with the evolution of curvaton with polynomial potential more accurately in comparison to the existing analytical methods.</description>

A brief review of phenomenological consequences in the context of AS regarding cosmology with emphasis on dark energy is given. Furthermore, recent studies that suggest a natural explanation of the recent cosmic acceleration and its coincidence using large-scale structure and AS framework will be analyzed.

      <title>Multi-messenger signatures of a deformed magnetar in gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a newly formed magnetized neutron-star (NS) as a power source of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the light of both gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiations. The compressible and incompressible fluids are employed in order to model the secular evolution of Maclaurian spheroids. It is shown that the GW and EM light curves evolve as a function of eccentricity and rotational frequency with time. We find that the light curve characteristics crucially depend on NS parameters such as magnitude and structure of magnetic field, ellipticity and the equation of state (EOS) of the fluid. The presence of X-ray flares, whose origins are not yet well understood, can be captured in our model regarding some specific nuclear EOSs. Our model allowing us to explain flares that occur within the wide range of $ 10$ to $10^4$ seconds and the peak luminosity in the order of $10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\rm \text{erg}/s$ by using a reasonable set of parameters such as magnetic field strength around $10^{14}-10^{16}$ Gauss, the quadrupole to dipole ratio of magnetic field up to 500. By applying our model to a sample of GRB X-ray flares observed by Swift/XRT, we try to constraint the crucial parameters of a deformed magnetar via MCMC fitting method. Our analysis shows that ongoing and upcoming joint multi-messenger detections can be used to understand the nature of GRB's central engine and its evolution at the early times of the burst formation.</description>

Abstract: The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results also have difference with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses, shows the reason of different GW power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Origin of hadron spin based on Lattice QCD study on the charmed hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first Lattice calculation about the charmed hadron spin decomposition using overlap fermions on a 2+1 flavor RBC/UKQCD domain-wall gauge configurations at 0.083 fm with 300 MeV pion mass. It is found that the contributions of quark spin to the spin of 1S, 1P charmonia and also proton-like triple heavy quark state are comparable with the expectation of non-relativistic quark model. Such an observation provides evidence that the non-triviality of proton spin decomposition mainly arises from the relativistic effects of the light quark. Conversely, the substantial gluon angular momentum contribution in the spin $(1/2)^+$ state with triple heavy quarks at the charm quark mass, remains significant, highlighting the ongoing importance of the gluon in the realm of charmed baryon physics.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our experiments provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalization and non-renormalization of scalar EFTs at higher orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We renormalize massless scalar effective field theories (EFTs) to higher loop orders and higher orders in the EFT expansion. To facilitate EFT calculations with the R* renormalization method, we construct suitable operator bases using Hilbert series and related ideas in commutative algebra and conformal representation theory, including their novel application to off-shell correlation functions. We obtain new results ranging from full one loop at mass dimension twelve to five loops at mass dimension six. We explore the structure of the anomalous dimension matrix with an emphasis on its zeros, and investigate the effects of conformal and orthonormal operators. For the real scalar, the zeros can be explained by a `non-renormalization' rule recently derived by Bern et al. For the complex scalar we find two new selection rules for mixing $n$- and $(n-2)$-field operators, with $n$ the maximal number of fields at a fixed mass dimension. The first appears only when the $(n-2)$-field operator is conformal primary, and is valid at one loop. The second appears in more generic bases, and is valid at three loops. Finally, we comment on how the Hilbert series we construct may be used to provide a systematic enumeration of a class of evanescent operators that appear at a particular mass dimension in the scalar EFT.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from dense environments : Flavor mechanisms, theoretical approaches, observations, and new directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11814v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino masses and mixings produce vacuum oscillations, an established quantum mechanical phenomenon. In matter, the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect, due to neutrino interactions with the background particles, triggers resonant flavor modification. In dense environments, such as core-collapse supernovae or compact mergers, sizable neutrino-neutrino interactions, shock waves and turbulence impact the neutrino flavor content under a variety of phenomena. Theoretical approaches of neutrino propagation range from the mean-field approximation to the full quantum kinetic equations. Intriguing connections have been uncovered between weakly interacting dense neutrino gases and other many-body systems and domains, from condensed matter and nuclear physics to quantum computing. Besides the intrinsic theoretical interest, establishing how neutrinos change flavor contributes to answer the longstanding open questions of how massive stars explode and of the r-process sites. It is also important for future observations of core-collapse supernova neutrinos and of the diffuse supernova neutrino background that should be discovered in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Froggatt-Nielsen Meets the SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the matching of Froggatt-Nielsen theories of flavour onto the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), upon integrating out a heavy Beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) scalar `flavon' whose vacuum expectation value breaks an Abelian flavour symmetry at energies $\Lambda_\text{FN}$ well above the electroweak scale, $\Lambda_\text{FN} &gt; \Lambda_\text{SM}$. We include matching contributions to the infrared $d_\text{SM}=6$ (Warsaw basis) SMEFT sourced from ultraviolet contact terms suppressed up to order $1 / \Lambda_\text{UV}^2$ in the Froggatt-Nielsen Lagrangian, where $\Lambda_\text{UV} &gt; \Lambda_\text{FN}$ is an arbitrary deep-ultraviolet scale where further unspecified BSM particles are dynamical. This includes tree-level (one-loop) ultraviolet diagrams with $d_{\text{FN}}=6$ $(5)$ effective vertices. We first do so with a toy model, but then generalize our findings to arbitrary Frogatt-Nielsen charges. Our results indicate a rich and non-trivial signature of Froggatt-Nielsen theories on the (otherwise) model-independent operators of the SMEFT, and we briefly speculate on extending our analysis to broader classes of BSM flavour models, e.g. non-Abelian and/or gauged theories. We thus take an important step towards determining how to use rapidly developing theoretical and experimental SMEFT technologies to gain unambiguous insight into the SM's longstanding fermion flavour puzzle.</description>

Abstract: Resonant positron annihilation on atomic electrons provides a powerful method to search for light new particles coupled to $e^+e^-$. Reliable estimates of production rates require a detailed characterization of electron momentum distributions. We describe a general method that harnesses the target material Compton profile to properly include electron velocity effects in resonant annihilation cross-sections. We additionally find that high $Z$ atoms can efficiently act as particle physics accelerators, providing a density of relativistic electrons that allows to extend by several times the experimental mass reach.</description>

      <title>Probing Stochastic Ultralight Dark Matter with Space-based Gravitational-Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight particles are theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates. In the vicinity of the solar system, these ultralight particles can be described as a superposition of plane waves, resulting in a stochastic field with sizable amplitude fluctuations on scales determined by the velocity dispersion of dark matter. In this work, we systematically investigate the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave interferometers to the stochastic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field within the frequentist framework. We derive the projected sensitivity of a single detector using the time-delay interferometry. Our results show that space-based gravitational-wave interferometers have the potential to probe unconstrained regions in parameter space and improve the current limit on coupling strengths. Furthermore, we explore the sensitivity of a detector network and investigate the optimal configuration for ULDM detection. We introduce the overlap reduction function for ULDM, which quantifies the degree of correlation between the signals observed by different detectors. We find that the configuration, where the signals observed by two detectors are uncorrelated, is the optimal choice for ULDM detection due to a smaller chance of missing signal. This contrasts with the detection of stochastic gravitational-wave background, where the correlated configuration is preferred. Our results may provide useful insights for potential joint observations involving space-based gravitational-wave detectors like LISA and Taiji, as well as other ULDM detection networks operating in the coherence limit.</description>

Abstract: We study the phenomenology of $d=6$ dipole portal operators connecting active and sterile neutrinos at a futuristic muon collider. These operators can be the dominant portal between the Standard Model and the New Physics sector in scenarios in which the active-sterile mixing is suppressed. We identify two production modes for sterile neutrinos: one proceeding through the exchange of an $s-$channel electroweak boson and one arising from the fusion of an electroweak boson with a Standard Model lepton. We study the expected reach on the operators suppression scale for these different production mechanisms, showing that the latter offers the best sensitivity and allowing to test a New Physics scale in the $\sim 10\;$TeV range.</description>

Abstract: We compute amplitudes for the process $g^* g^* \to q \overline q V^*$ (two virtual gluons into a quark, antiquark and a boson) at the tree level using the spinor-helicity formalism. The resulting analytic expressions are much shorter than squared amplitudes obtained using trace methods. Our results can be used to expedite numerical calculations in phenomenological studies of the Drell-Yan process in high energy factorization framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of phase transitions (PT) in quantum field theories at finite temperature is most accurately described within the framework of dimensional reduction. In this framework, thermodynamic quantities are computed within the 3-dimensional effective field theory (EFT) that results from integrating out the high-temperature Matsubara modes. However, strong-enough PTs, observable in gravitational wave (GW) detectors, occur often nearby the limit of validity of the EFT, where effective operators can no longer be neglected. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of these interactions on the determination of PT parameters. We find that they allow for strong PTs in a wider region of parameter space, and that both the peak frequency and the amplitude of the resulting GW power spectrum can change by more than one order of magnitude when they are included. As a byproduct of this work, we derive equations for computing the bounce solution in the presence of higher-derivative terms, consistently with the EFT power counting.</description>

Abstract: We extend our previous work [1] on calculating non-global logarithms in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation to Higgs/vector boson production in association with a single hard jet at hadron colliders. We analytically compute non-global coefficients in the jet mass distribution up to four loops using the anti-k$_t$ jet algorithm. Our calculations are performed in the eikonal approximation, assuming strong energy ordering for the emitted gluons, thus capturing only the leading logarithms of the distribution. We compare our analytical results with the all-orders large-N$_c$ numerical solution. In general, the gross features of the non-global logarithm distribution observed in the $e^+ e^-$ case remain valid for the V/H+jet processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental investigations of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter involve collisions of heavy ions at ultrarelativistic velocities. The medium created in such a collision is often of dimensions a few fermi, in particular in the Beam Energy Scan experiments. An understanding of the effect of the finite volume and the boundary is important for connecting the experimental results to the phase diagram.
  Using the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, an effective theory for the chiral transition of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we have studied the effect of the finite volume of the fireball on the transition line at finite temperature and density using the MIT boundary condition to mimic the condition that the system is deconfined inside. The shift of the transition temperature for finite volume and finite volume effect on number density and its susceptibilities are studied. The volume effects should be considered when looking for signatures of the phase diagram in experiments.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the flavour phenomenology and collider signatures of flavon of $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M}$ flavour symmetries for the soft symmetry-breaking scenario and a new symmetry-conserving mechanism at the high-luminosity LHC, high energy LHC, and a 100 TeV hadron collider. The flavour physics of quark and leptonic observables places different bounds on the parameter space of flavons of $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M}$ flavour symmetries. On the collider side, the decay $t \rightarrow c a$ can be probed by the high-luminosity LHC, high energy LHC, and a 100 TeV hadron collider for the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm 8} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm 22}$ flavour symmetry. The inclusive production signatures can be used to probe the flavon of all the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M} $ flavour symmetries for the soft symmetry-breaking scenario for a heavy flavon at a 100 TeV collider. Flavons of all the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm N} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm M} $ flavour symmetries can be probed at high energy LHC and a 100 TeV collider for a low mass in the case of soft symmetry-breaking. The di-flavon production is within reach of the high-luminosity LHC, high energy LHC, and a 100 TeV collider only for a light flavon. The 14 TeV high-luminosity LHC can probe only the $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm 2} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm 5}$ and $\mathcal{Z}_{\rm 8} \times \mathcal{Z}_{\rm 22}$ flavour symmetries for a few specific inclusive signatures. The symmetry-conserving scenario remains beyond the detection capabilities of any collider.</description>

      <title>The infamous 95 GeV $\rm b \bar b$ excess at LEP: Two b or not two b?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A small deviation observed around 95 GeV in the diphoton invariant mass distribution in the LHC Run 2 data has been subject to considerable attention in the past couple of years. The interpretation of this excess as the manifestation of an additional scalar particle at this mass is often claimed to be supported by a previously observed, even smaller, excess in the b\=b invariant mass distribution in LEP data. This short note aims at confronting this claim to factual experimental observations, through a careful scrutiny of the detailed LEP public notes written at the time on the topic. It is found that the LEP data strongly disfavour the production of a new 95 GeV scalar particle, as well as any other new physics interpretation in the 95-100 GeV mass range.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Wakes of Jets with Energy-Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the partons in a jet propagate through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in a heavy-ion collision, they lose energy to, kick, and are kicked by the medium. The resulting modifications to the parton shower encode information about the microscopic nature of QGP. The momentum and energy lost by the parton shower are gained by the medium and, since QGP is a strongly coupled liquid, this means that the jet excites a wake in the droplet of QGP. After freezeout, this wake becomes soft hadrons with net momentum in the jet direction meaning that reconstructed jets include hadrons originating from both the modified parton shower and its wake. This makes it challenging to find an unambiguous experimental view of the response of a droplet of QGP to a jet. Recent years have seen significant advances in the understanding of the substructure of jets using correlation functions of the energy flux operator. So far, such studies have focused primarily on the two-point correlator, which serves to identify the angular scale of the underlying dynamics. Higher-point correlators hold the promise of mapping out the dynamics themselves. We perform the first study of the shape-dependent three-point energy-energy-energy correlator in heavy-ion collisions. Using the Hybrid Model to simulate the interactions of high energy jets with QGP, we show that hadrons originating from wakes are the dominant contribution to the three-point correlator in the regime where the three points are well-separated in angle, forming a roughly equilateral triangle. This equilateral region of the correlator is far from the region populated by collinear vacuum emissions, making it a canvas on which jet wakes can be imaged. Our work is a key step towards the systematic use of energy correlators to image and unravel the dynamical response of a droplet of QGP to a passing jet, and motivates many experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time approximation revisited and pole/cut structure in retarded correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to discuss the following two questions:
  Q1. Mathematical justification of the model of relaxation time approximation (RTA);
  Q2. Pole/cut structure in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description.
  We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Furthermore, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived non-analytical structures in this case. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenspectrum leads to dominant long-lived branch-cuts. When particles are massive or the perturbations are inhomogeneous, the non-analytical structures become more complex and richer.</description>

      <title>Hunting for bileptons at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I review possible signals at hadron colliders of bileptons, namely doubly-charged vectors or scalars with lepton number L=+/- 2, as predicted by a 331 model, based on a SU(3)_c x SU(3)_L x U(1)_X$ symmetry.In particular, I account for a version of the 331 model, wherein the embedding of the hypercharge is obtained with the addition of 3 exotic quarks and vector bileptons. Furthermore, a sextet of SU(3)_L, necessary to give masses to leptons, yields an extra scalar sector, including a doubly-charged Higgs, i.e. scalar bileptons. As bileptons are mostly produced in pairs at hadron colliders, their main signal is given by two same-sign lepton pairs at high invariant mass. Nevertheless, they can also decay according to non-leptonic modes, such as a TeV-scale heavy quark, charged 4/3 or 5/3, plus a Standard Model quark. I explore both leptonic and non-leptonic decays and the sensitivity to such processes of present and future hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Exclusive rare semileptonic decays of $B$ and $B_c$ mesons in the relativistic independent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive rare semileptonic decays: $B(B_c)\to K(D_{(s)})l\bar{l}/\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l}$ ($l=\mu, \tau$) in the framework of relativistic independent quark (RIQ) model based on an average flavor independent confining potential in equally mixed scalar-vector harmonic form. The invariant weak form factors, parametrising the matrix elements between participating meson states are calculated in the parent meson rest frame. The momentum transfer dependence of the form factors is reliably determined in the whole accessible kinematical range: $q^2_{min}\leq 0\leq q^2_{max}$. Our predicted branching fractions for $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-/\tau^+\tau^-(\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l})$, $B_c\to D(D_s)\mu^+\mu^-$, $B_c\to D(D_s)\tau^+\tau^-$ and $B_c\to D(D_s)\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l}$, obtained in order of $10^{-7}(10^{-6})$, $10^{-9}(10^{-7})$, $10^{-9}(10^{-8})$ and $10^{-8}(10^{-7})$, respectively are in reasonable agreement with other Standard Model predictions and Lattice QCD results. The averaged values of the lepton polarization asymmetries for decay modes are obtained as $\langle P_L(B\to K\mu^+\mu^-)\rangle$=-0.97, $\langle P_L(B_c\to D_{(s)}\mu^+\mu^-)\rangle$=-0.972, $\langle P_L(B\to K\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.224, $\langle P_L(B_c\to D\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.275 and $\langle P_L(B_c\to D_s\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.194.</description>

Abstract: Using $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, and $\Upsilon(3S)$ data collected by the Belle detector, we discover a new three-body decay, $\Omega(2012)^-\to\Xi(1530)\bar K\to\Xi\pi\bar K$, with a significance of 5.2~$\sigma$. The mass of the $\Omega(2012)^-$ is $(2012.5\pm0.7\pm0.5)$ MeV and its effective couplings to $\Xi(1530)\bar{K}$ and $\Xi\bar{K}$ are $(39^{+31}_{-39}\pm9)\times10^{-2}$ and $(1.7\pm0.3\pm0.3)\times10^{-2}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. The ratio of the branching fraction for the three-body decay to that for the two-body decay to $\Xi\bar{K}$ is $0.99\pm0.26\pm0.06$, assuming isospin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Numerical indication that center vortices drive dynamical mass generation in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first calculation of the response of the momentum space quark propagator to center vortices in the ground state fields of QCD is presented. Center vortices are identified on 2+1-flavour dynamical gauge fields with $m_\pi \simeq 156$ MeV to obtain the vortex-removed and vortex-only quark propagator. Dynamical mass generation is found to vanish upon vortex removal, while the vortex-only field is able to generate dynamical mass. These new signatures strengthen the lattice QCD evidence indicating that center vortices underpin both dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement.</description>

      <title>Quasithermal GeV neutrinos from neutron-loaded magnetized outflows in core-collapse supernovae: spectra and light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized protoneutron stars (PNSs) created in core-collapse supernovae can drive relativistic magnetized winds. Ions and neutrons can be co-accelerated while they remain coupled through elastic collisions. We investigate the nucleosynthesis and subsequent nuclear disintegration, and find that relativistic neutrons can be generated in such magnetized winds. Upon eventual decoupling, resulting inelastic collisions with ejecta lead to pion production, resulting in $0.1-10\,{\rm GeV}$ neutrinos. Following this scenario presented in Murase, Dasgupta \&amp; Thompson, Phys. Rev. D, 89, 043012 (2014), we numerically calculate the spectra and light curves of quasithermal neutrino emission. In the event of a Galactic supernova, $\sim 10-1000$ neutrino events could be detected with Hyper-Kamiokande, KM3Net-ORCA and IceCube-Upgrade for PNSs with surface magnetic field $B_{\rm dip}\sim 10^{13-15}\,{\rm G}$ and initial spin period $P_i \sim 1-30\,{\rm ms}$. Successful detection will enable us to study supernovae as multienergy neutrino sources and may provide clues to the roles of PNSs in diverse classes of transients.</description>

      <title>Neutron star mass in dark matter clumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a hypothesis proposed in previous research relating neutron star (NS) mass and its dark matter (DM) accumulation. As DM accumulates, NS mass decreases, predicting lower NS masses toward the Galactic center. Due to limited NSs data near the galactic center, we examine NSs located within DM clumps. Using the CLUMPY code simulations, we determine the DM clumps distribution, with masses from 10 to $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$ and scales from $10^{-3}$ to 10 kpc. These clumps' DM exhibit a peak at the center, tapering toward the outskirts, resembling our Galaxy's DM distribution.
  We analyse these DM clumps' NS mass variations, considering diverse DM particle masses and galaxy types. We find relatively stable NS mass within 0.01 to 5 kpc from the clump center. This stability supports the initial hypothesis, particularly for NSs located beyond 0.01 kpc from the clump center, where NS mass reaches a plateau around 0.1 kpc. Nevertheless, NS mass near the clump's periphery reveals spatial dependence: NS position within DM clumps influences its mass in Milky Way-type galaxies. Moreover, this dependence varies with the DM model considered.
  In summary, our study investigates the proposed link between NS mass and DM accumulation by examining NSs within DM clumps. While NS mass remains stable at certain distances from the clump center, spatial dependencies arise near the clump's outer regions, contingent on the specific DM model.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Simulations of Axion String-Wall Networks: Probing Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves for Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simultaneously study gravitational waves (GWs) and free axions emitted from axionic string-wall networks in the early universe using advanced 3D lattice simulations. Our simulations start before the Peccei-Quinn phase transition and end with the destruction of string-wall networks below the QCD scale. The axion dark matter (DM) relic abundance radiated from string-wall networks are updated and refined for the scenarios of $N_{\rm DW}&gt;1$. In this scenario, we observe that the GW spectrum is almost independent of the bias term and $N_{\rm DW}$, and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\propto f^{1.29}(f^{-0.43})$ in the IR and middle-frequency regions. After considering the constraints from DM relic abundance, we found that the QCD axion model predicts undetectable GW emissions, and the axion-like particles model allows for a detectable GW signal in the nano-Hertz to the milli-Hertz frequency range corresponding to axion masses range from KeV to TeV. For $N_{\rm DW}=1$, the GW energy density appears undetectable for QCD axions and axion-like particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors with Rydberg atoms. Rydberg atoms are ultra-sensitive detectors of electric fields. By setting up a constant magnetic field, a weak electric field is generated upon the arrival of GWs. The weak electric field signal is then detected by an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the system of the Rydberg atoms. Recently, the minimum detectable electric field with the Rydberg atoms is further improved by employing superheterodyne detection method. Hence, even the weak signal generated by GWs turns out to be detectable. We calculate the amplitude of Rabi frequency of the Rydberg atoms induced by the GWs and show that the sensitivity of the Rydberg atoms becomes maximum when the size of the Rydberg atoms is close to the wavelength of GWs. We evaluate the minimum detectable amplitude of GWs with Rubidium Rydberg atoms and find that the detector can probe GWs with a frequency $f=4.2$ GHz and an amplitude around $10^{-20}$.</description>

Abstract: Interacting quark stars, which are entirely composed of interacting quark matter including perturbative QCD corrections and color superconductivity, can meet constraints from various pulsar observations. In realistic scenarios, pressure anisotropies are expected in the star's interior. Recently, the stellar structural properties of anisotropic interacting quark stars have been investigated. In this study, we further explore the universal relations (URs) related to the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability $\Lambda$, compactness $C$, and the $f$-mode nonradial pulsation frequency for such stars. Our results reveal that these approximate URs generally hold, being insensitive to both the EOS variations as well as to the presence of anisotropy. In contrast to previous studies on anisotropic neutron stars, we find that more positive anisotropy tends to enhance the $I-\Lambda$ and $I-C$ URs, but weakens the $C-\Lambda$ UR. For all the URs involving $f$-mode frequency, we find that they are enhanced by the inclusion of anisotropy (whether positive or negative). Utilizing these URs and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event, we put limits on the structural properties of isotropic and anisotropic quark stars, such as the moment of inertia $I_{1.4}$, the canonical radius $R_{1.4}$ and the canonical $f$-mode frequency $f_{f,1.4}$, all of which are very different compared to those of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic bound on slow-roll parameter in stringy quintessence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the late time behavior of the scalar part of the volume modulus and the dilaton in stringy quintessence model, focusing on their contributions to the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ which directly measures the deviation of the spacetime geometry from de Sitter space. When only one of the moduli is allowed to move, $\epsilon$ converges to the stable fixed point at late time. The fixed point value is larger than $1$, thus the slow-roll cannot be realized. Moreover, if the decay rate of the quintessence potential is larger than some critical value, the positivity of the potential imposes that the stable fixed point value is just given by $3$, independent of the details of the moduli dynamics. Otherwise, the fixed point value coincides with the potential slow-roll parameter. When both the volume modulus and the dilaton roll down the potential simultaneously, we can find the relation between the contributions of two moduli to $\epsilon$ satisfied at the fixed point. In this case, the fixed point value is not in general the simple sum of fixed point values in the single field case and cannot be larger than $3$.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution of Dark Matter Spike around Schwarzschild Black Holes and Effects on Gravitational Waves from EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) constitutes the predominant portion of matter in our universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly-interacting massive particles, which may clump into steep concentrations around the central black holes of galaxies. However, DM profiles of the resulting dense spikes remain uncertain. Here we employ the relativistic dynamics in Schwarzschild geometry and first evaluate the velocity distributions of DM within such spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we identify universal features in DM profiles and fit them with Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we illustrate with the impact of dynamical friction on gravitational waves generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within DM spikes, taking into account the velocity distribution of DM in the relativistic regime. Our findings demonstrate the phase shifts in the time-domain waveform, potentially providing useful insights for probing DM in galactic centers by gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Valence Quark PDFs of the Proton from Two-Current Correlations in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following previous works on that topic, we consider Euclidean hadronic matrix elements in position space of two spatially separated local currents on the lattice, in order to extract the $x$ dependence of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The corresponding approach is often referred to by the term lattice cross section. In this work we will consider valence quark PDFs of an unpolarized proton. We adapt the previously established formalism to our choice of operators. The calculation of the two-current matrix elements requires the evaluation of four-point functions. The corresponding calculation is carried out on a $n_f = 2+1$ gauge ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.0856~\mathrm{fm}$ and pseudoscalar masses $m_\pi = 355~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $m_K = 441~\mathrm{MeV}$. The four-point functions have been evaluated in a previous project. The lattice data is converted to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at a scale $\mu=2~\mathrm{GeV}$ and improved with respect to lattice artifacts. We use a common model as fit ansatz for the lattice data in order to extract the PDFs.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum at 1-loop in the Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute 1-loop corrections to the bispectrum in the decoupling limit of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation (EFToI). We regulate the divergences by employing dimensional regularization and work in $d=3+\delta$ dimensions. We find that the final results feature analytic structures of the form $\log{\left(k_i/k_T\right)}$ and $\log{\left(H/\mu\right)}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\mu$ is the renormalisation scale. An interesting outcome of our calculations is that unlike the 1-loop correction to the power-spectrum computed in arXiv:0912.2734 the unrenormalised answers always produce unphysical logarithms of co-moving momenta. These unphysical logarithms are cancelled only after renormalisation. We expect this to be a generic feature for loop computations unless there is some cancellation as in the previously computed 1-loop result for the power-spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stabilization of a twisted modulus in Type IIB flux compactifications on a mirror of the rigid Calabi-Yau threefold. By analyzing the effective action of twisted and untwisted moduli, we find that three-form fluxes satisfying the tadpole cancellation conditions lead to supersymmetric AdS vacua. We also investigate swampland conjectures on this non-geometric background.</description>

      <title>Charm physics with overlap fermions on 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $D_s$, $\eta_c$ and vector mesons $D^*$, $D_s^*$, $J/\psi$ are determined from $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at a lattice spacing $a\sim0.08$ fm. For vector mesons, the decay constants defined by tensor currents are given in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The calculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence quarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser lattice spacing $a\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the discretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\overline{\rm MS},\text{2 GeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result. Combining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$ determined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\times10^{-5}$ for $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.</description>

      <title>Experimental Method to Constrain Preferential Emission and Spectator Dynamics in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental method to directly correlate initial participant asymmetry with final-state multiplicity to quantify contribution of preferential emission to the rapidity-odd component of pseudorapidity distribution of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions. Within a transport model simulation, the correlator displays an increase from mid to large rapidities and from central to peripheral collisions. It also displays sensitivity to spectator dynamics, with its magnitude decreasing as more spectators undergo evaporation or fragmentation. The proposed correlator provides a powerful experimental tool to constrain particle production mechanisms and the space-time evolution of spectator matter in heavy-ion collisions</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological theory where the kinetic term and potential have $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. Potentials have a plateau at large values of the inflaton field, where the axion forms a flat direction. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry and special features of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ potentials, the theory exhibits an $\alpha$-attractor behavior: its cosmological predictions are stable with respect to significant modifications of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric version of this theory in the framework of $\overline {D3}$ induced geometric inflation. The choice of $\alpha$ is determined by underlying string compactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has $3\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\'e disk target for LiteBIRD</description>

      <title>Neutral pion polarizabilities from four-point functions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle lattice QCD simulation of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities for a neutral pion in the four-point function method. The results are based on the same quenched Wilson ensembles on a $24^3\times 48$ lattice at $\beta=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV previously used for a charged pion. For electric polarizability, the results are largely consistent with those from the background field method and ChPT. In contrast, there are significant differences for magnetic polarizability among the four-point function method, the background field method, and ChPT. The situation points to the potentially important role of disconnected diagrams for a neutral pion. We elucidate a transparent quark decomposition in the four-point function method that can be used to shed light on the issue.</description>

Abstract: The rates of production of radio/microwave N-identical photons states |N&gt; from stimulated emission in the solar atmosphere are estimated. Effects of various decohering factors are shown to be small. Ground based measurements of these quantum states via the inverse HOM effect are proposed.

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of gravitational atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic fields can form condensates, or clouds, around spinning black holes. When this system is under the influence of a secondary massive body, its tidal response can be quantified in the tidal Love numbers (TLNs). Although TLNs vanish for black holes in vacuum, it has been shown that the same is not true for black holes immersed in matter environments. In this work, we compute the gravitational TLNs of black holes surrounded by scalar clouds, in the Newtonian limit. We show that they are non-vanishing, have a strong power-law dependence on the boson's mass, and are proportional to the scalar cloud's total mass. In particular, we find that, independently of the cloud's configuration, the TLNs from axisymmetric tides scale as $\propto r_c^{2l+1}$, for $r_c$ the cloud's "radius" and $l$ the multipole order of the external tidal field. This differs by a factor $r_c$ from previous estimates based on scalar and vector tidal perturbations but is in perfect agreement with the behavior of TLNs in other matter systems. Furthermore, we show that the adiabatic tides approximation we employ is, in general, not appropriate for non-axisymmetric tidal interactions.</description>

      <title>Two dark components of de Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath for matter with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter. Here do not consider the real matter, but only the component which is related to the gravitational degrees of freedom and participates the thermodynamics of the de Sitter state. This gravitational component behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter. The vacuum energy and the analog of the Zel'dovich stiff matter represent correspondingly the dark energy and dark matter. In equilibrium the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is rather similar to the correspondingly superfluid and normal components of superfluid liquid, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. We extend this two dark components approach and the suggest the phenomenological theory, which describes the dynamics of the dark energy and the dark matter. For that we assume that the in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter also behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter. In this phenomenological model, both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. How this phenomenology is supported by the microscopic physics is an open question.</description>
