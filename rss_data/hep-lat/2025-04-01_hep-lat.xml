      <title>Inclusive processes from lattice QCD: problems and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strategy to compute inclusive hadronic processes in lattice QCD is discussed. The key idea is to view the inclusive decay or scattering rate as a smeared spectrum. The Euclidean time dependence of correlators obtained on the lattice can be used to approximate them. The method induces its own systematic errors in addition to the standard discretization effects and so on. It is crucial to estimate them in a rigorous manner to achieve first-principles calculations of this important new class of quantities.</description>

      <title>Left-hand cut problem in lattice QCD and an EFT-based solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice QCD has become an essential tool for studying the hadron-hadron interaction from the first principles. However, when extracting infinite-volume scattering parameters from finite-volume energy levels, the traditional L\"uscher formula encounters limitations due to the left-hand cut induced by long-range interactions such as the one-pion exchange. In this work, we propose an alternative approach based on chiral effective field theory combined with a Hamiltonian method in the plane wave basis. By solving a Schr\"odinger-like equation in the finite volume, our method connects the finite-volume energy spectrum with infinite-volume observables, while systematically incorporating the long-range physics and solving the left-hand cut problem. The use of the plane wave basis mitigates issues related to partial wave mixing. Our numerical results for $DD^*$ scattering at $m_\pi \approx$ 280 MeV demonstrate that this approach overcomes the limitations of the L\"uscher method and points towards a resonance interpretation of the $T_{cc}(3875)$ state, as opposed to the virtual state predicted by traditional analyses.</description>

      <title>Exclusion of a diquark-antidiquark structure for the lightest positive-parity charmed mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of low-lying scalar and axial-vector charmed mesons has been debated for decades, with hadronic molecular and compact tetraquark models being prominent candidates. These two models predict quite different features for the accessible SU(3) multiplets in the scalar and axial-vector sectors, which can be tested through lattice calculations at SU(3) symmetric points. In this work, we perform lattice calculations for both scalar and axial-vector charmed mesons with an SU(3) symmetric pion mass about 613 MeV for the SU(3) $[6]$ and $[\overline{15}]$ multiplets. We find that the $[6]$ multiplet exhibits attractive interactions in both scalar and axial-vector sectors, while the $[\overline{15}]$ multiplet shows repulsive interactions in both sectors. The energy shifts in the scalar and axial-vector sectors are compatible with each other within uncertainties. These results are fully consistent with the hadronic molecular picture, while challenging the compact tetraquark model, which predicts the existence of low-lying $[\overline{15}]$ states in the axial-vector sector but not in the scalar sector.</description>

      <title>One Born Oppenheimer Effective Theory to rule all Exotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of XYZ exotic states in the hadronic sector with two heavy quarks constitute one of the most important open problems in particle theory. In this work, we demonstrate that the QCD derived Born-Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT) framework, provides a systematic framework to describe exotic states of arbitrary composition. The BOEFT construction is based on QCD taking into consideration the scale separation and symmetry of systems containing two heavy quarks. We show the results for the coupled channel Schr\"odinger equations incorporating nonadiabatic mixing terms that describes exotic states for arbitrary quantum number of the light degrees of freedom: hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons, and quarkonia at leading order. Additionally, we present the results of the predicted spin-symmetry multiplets, and the expression of the nonperturbative gauge-invariant correlators to be computed on lattice that are required for BOEFT: static energies, generalized Wilson loops, gluelumps, adjoint mesons or baryons, and triplet or sextext mesons or baryons. Moreover, for the static energies, we describe the short-distance behavior based on multipole expansion and the mixing with heavy-light thresholds at long distances based on the conserved quantum numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk, we present a series of recent works on the electromagnetic and axial-vector structures of low-lying singly heavy baryons. We first explain the pion mean-field approach, in which light and singly heavy baryons can be considered on an equal footing. We then discuss the results for the electromagnetic and radiative transition form factors of the singly heavy baryons. We also demonstrate the results for the strong decay rates and quark spin content of the singly heavy baryons. Finally, we propose a consistent way of dealing with the $1/m_Q$ corrections in the pion mean-field approach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the nucleon and their mechanical structure: Twist-2 case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a series of recent works on the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the nucleon within a pion mean-field approach, which is also called the chiral quark-soliton model. We investigate the flavor structure of the mass, angular momentum, and $D$-term form factors of the nucleon. The main findings of the present work are given as follows: the contribution of the strange quark is rather small for the mass and angular momentum form factors, it plays an essential role in the $D$-term form factors. It indicates that the $D$-term form factor is sensitive to the outer part of the nucleon. The flavor blindness, i.e, $D^{u-d}\simeq 0$, is valid only if the strange quark is considered. We also discuss the effects of twist-4 operators. Though the gluonic contributions are suppressed by the packing fraction of the instanton vacuum in the twist-2 case, contributions from twist-4 operators are significant.</description>

Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of non-equilibrium matter under extreme conditions lies beyond the capabilities of classical computation alone. Remarkable advances in quantum information science and technology are profoundly changing how we understand and explore fundamental quantum many-body systems, and have brought us to the point of simulating essential aspects of these systems using quantum computers. I discuss highlights, opportunities and the challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars and Constraints for the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a natural laboratory for studying the properties of dense nuclear matter under extreme conditions. In this proceeding, we review our current understanding of dense isospin symmetric and asymmetric matter and neutron star physics. We focus on modern theoretical, experimental, and observational constraints, including first-principle calculations from lattice and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), as well as chiral effective field theory approaches at nuclear densities. From the experimental perspective, constraints on the equation of state arise from heavy-ion collisions, low-energy nuclear physics, and astrophysical observations, including neutron star masses, radii, and gravitational wave signatures from mergers. These multidisciplinary comparisons are crucial for bridging the gap between nuclear physics and astrophysical observations, in order to expand our knowledge of matter at supra-nuclear densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two approaches towards supersymmetry: The ``conventional approach'', in which the fields appear in the classical action and the ``stochastic approach'', in which they emerge upon introducing in the action the contribution of a certain determinant. The second approach relies, in particular, on the so-called Nicolai map. The relation between the two approaches hasn't been clarified and the subject of this contribution is to spell it out. In particular the interpretation proposed by Parisi and Sourlas has remained quite incomplete. The subject of this contribution is to spell out in what way the two approaches complement each other and how the second can provide insights for the first.</description>

      <title>Investigating nuclear beta decay using lattice quantum Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an \textit{ab initio} calculation of nuclear $\beta$-decay within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT), employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo methods to solve the nuclear many-body problem. Our approach combines next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) two- and three-body chiral interactions with one- and two-body axial current operators, all consistently derived in chiral effective field theory. Low-energy constants are determined exclusively from nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts and few-body observables for systems with $A \leq 3$. Using these interactions and transition operators, we perform two-channel Monte Carlo simulations to compute the $\beta$-decay matrix element for $^6$He, obtaining results in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. To address the Monte Carlo sign problem, we implement a perturbative expansion around a leading-order Hamiltonian with approximate Wigner-SU(4) symmetry. This systematic approach provides a foundation for extending NLEFT simulations to precision studies of weak processes in medium-mass nuclei.</description>

      <title>$K$-theoretic computation of the Atiyah(-Patodi)-Singer index of lattice Dirac operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Wilson Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory can be identified as a mathematical object in $K$-theory and that its associated spectral flow is equal to the index. In comparison to the standard lattice Dirac operator index, our formulation does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and has broader applicability to systems with boundaries and to the mod-two version of the indices in general dimensions. We numerically verify that the $K$ and $KO$ group formulas reproduce the known index theorems in continuum theory. We examine the Atiyah-Singer index on a flat two-dimensional torus and, for the first time, demonstrate that the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index with nontrivial curved boundaries, as well as the mod-two versions, can be computed on a lattice.</description>

      <title>Leading qT/Q correction for Drell-Yan in TMD factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization theorem accommodates various types of power corrections. Among them, the least studied are qT/Q corrections, which become significant at large values of transverse momentum. These corrections partially originate from higher-twist TMD distributions, which exhibit singularity at small transverse distances. We propose a decomposition that reveals this singularity explicitly, and makes the qT/Q correction manifest. As a concrete application, we consider the next-to-leading power correction for the angular distributions in Drell-Yan, and determine the leading qT/Q corrections. These corrections are significant for the angular distributions A1 and A3, in complete agreement with the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Grassmann tensor network representing the partition function of (1+1)-dimensional two-color QCD with staggered fermions. The Grassmann path integral is rewritten as the trace of a Grassmann tensor network by introducing two-component auxiliary Grassmann fields on every edge of the lattice. We introduce an efficient initial tensor compression scheme to reduce the size of initial tensors. The Grassmann bond-weighted tensor renormalization group approach is adopted to evaluate the quark number density, fermion condensate, and diquark condensate at different gauge couplings as a function of the chemical potential. Different transition behavior is observed as the quark mass is varied. We discuss the efficiency of our initial tensor compression scheme and the future application toward the corresponding higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) relation elegantly captures how the anomalous chiral symmetry of a Dirac fermion manifests on the lattice. In this talk, we discuss how the GW relation and its closed-form solution, the overlap operator, can be generalized to Majorana or Dirac fermions in any dimension for finite symmetry transformations (continuous or discrete). We find an exact symmetry which reproduces both perturbative and global anomalies on the lattice. These generalized GW fermions are boundary theories of various bulk symmetry-protected topological phases and thus provide an explicit lattice realization of the fermionic bulk-boundary correspondence central to recent proposals for chiral gauge theories on the lattice.</description>

      <title>The $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors, $N_\text{c}$. We use lattice calculations in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate flavors, with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 560$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb: the $T_{cs0}^0(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^{++}(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^0(2900)$ and $T_{c\bar{s}1}^0(2900)$ states. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators with the form of two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. The resulting energy spectra is used to constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude by means of L\"uscher's quantization condition. We consider polynomial parametrizations of the phase shift, as well as one-loop chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions. We find that our lattice results follow the expected $N_\text{c}$ scaling and are sensitive to subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections. In addition, we constrain the scaling of different combinations of low-energy constants from matching to large $N_\text{c}$ ChPT. The results for the channel corresponding to a $(\pi^+ D^+_s - K^+ D^+)$ state show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\text{c}=3$, while this pole disappears at $N_\text{c}&gt;3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.</description>

      <title>The charge and magnetic radii of the nucleons from the generalized parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proton-radius puzzle refers to the discrepancy observed in measurements of the proton's charge radius when using different methods. This inconsistency has prompted extensive research and debate within the physics community, as it challenges the understanding of quantum electrodynamics and the fundamental properties of protons. In the present study, we determine the charge and magnetic radii of the proton and neutron through a global analysis of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness. We emphasize the importance of a simultaneous analysis of all available experimental data related to nucleon radii, rather than relying on individual experiments, specific observables, or limited kinematic regions. This comprehensive approach ensures robust and consistent results, avoiding values that are either too small or too large. Our analysis yields the following results: $ r_{pE} = 0.8558 \pm 0.0135~\textrm{fm} $, $ r_{pM} = 0.8268 \pm 0.0533~\textrm{fm} $, $ \left&lt;r_{nE}^2\right&gt; = -0.1181 \pm 0.0270~\textrm{fm}^2 $, and $ r_{nM} = 0.8367 \pm 0.0845~\textrm{fm} $.</description>

Abstract: We conduct an investigation on the spin $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$ semileptonic weak transition of single heavy baryons for the exclusive decay $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in three possible lepton channels within the three point QCD sum rule method. We compute the responsible form factors of this semileptonic decay by incorporating both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions of the operator product expansion series up to mass dimension six. Having acquired the form factors, the decay widths of the processes in all lepton channels are determined. Our findings as well as possible future experimental information can be employed in order to check the SM predictions and explore the possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.</description>
