      <title>The Classical Limit of Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider the classical (i.e., non-relativistic) limit of Teleparallel Gravity, a relativistic theory of gravity that is empirically equivalent to General Relativity and features torsional forces. I show that as the speed of light is allowed to become infinite, Teleparallel Gravity reduces to Newtonian Gravity without torsion. I compare these results to the torsion-free context and discuss their implications on the purported underdetermination between Teleparallel Gravity and General Relativity. I conclude by considering alternative approaches to the classical limit developed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Conventional Quantum Theory Does Not Support A Coherent Relational Account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review a counterexample to the frequent claim that discrepancies among observers resulting from conventional quantum theory's inability to define "measurement", such as those arising in the Wigner's Friend thought experiment, remain private and incommensurable. I consider the implications for a recent attempt to shield Relational Quantum Mechanics from such inconsistencies and conclude that it is not successful.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic and power-law entropies from convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an attempt to understand the origin and robustness of the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon entropic functional, we adopt a geometric approach and discuss the implications of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and of Dvoretzky's theorem on convex bodies for the choice of this functional form. We contrast these results with a more recent result on flowers of balls, which may be interpreted as suggesting the use of power-law entropies for some systems.</description>

      <title>Does locality plus perfect correlation imply determinism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 1964 paper by John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. There is an ongoing and vigorous debate on whether he relied on an assumption of determinism, or instead, as he later claimed, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is shown that the weak form of locality used in Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for such a derivation, whereas an independent form called outcome independence is sufficient even when weak locality does not hold. It further follows that outcome independence, by itself, implies that standard quantum mechanics is incomplete. It is also shown that an appeal by Bell to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky argument to support his claim fails, via examples that expose logical gaps in this argument. However, replacing the reality criterion underpinning the argument by a stronger criterion enables a rigorous derivation of both weak locality and determinism, as required for Bell's 1964 paper. Consequences for quantum interpretations, locality, and classical common causes are briefly discussed, with reference to an example of local classical indeterminism.</description>
