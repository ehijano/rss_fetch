      <title>Entropic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered phases of matter, such as solids, ferromagnets, superfluids, or quantum topological order, typically only exist at low temperatures. Despite this conventional wisdom, we present explicit local models in which all such phases persist to arbitrarily high temperature. This is possible since order in one degree of freedom can enable other degrees of freedom to strongly fluctuate, leading to "entropic order", whereby typical high energy states are ordered. Our construction, which utilizes interacting bosons, avoids existing no-go theorems on long-range order or entanglement at high temperature. We propose a simple model for high-temperature superconductivity using these general principles.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Bridge between Regular and Critical Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical and nonlinear systems, two qualitatively distinct parameter regions are typically identified: the regular region, characterized by smooth behavior of key quantities, and the critical region, where these quantities exhibit singularities or strong fluctuations. Due to their starkly different properties, these regions are often perceived as being weakly related, if at all. However, we demonstrate that these regions are intimately connected, a relationship that can be explicitly revealed using self-similar approximation theory. This framework enables the prediction of observable quantities near the critical point based on information from the regular region and vice versa. Remarkably, the method relies solely on asymptotic expansions with respect to a parameter, regardless of whether the expansion originates in the regular or critical region. The mathematical principles of self-similar theory remain consistent across both cases. We illustrate this connection by extrapolating from the regular region to predict the existence, location, and critical indices of a critical point of an equation of state for a statistical system, even when no direct information about the critical region is available. Conversely, we explore extrapolation from the critical to the regular region in systems with discrete scale invariance, where log-periodic oscillations in observables introduce additional complexity. Our findings provide insights and solutions applicable to diverse phenomena, including material fracture, stock market crashes, and earthquake forecasting.</description>

      <title>Many body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry and local TRS - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

      <title>The limits of knowledge in classical physics resemble the quantum uncertainty relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon a recent analysis of the measurement process in Hamiltonian mechanics, this article investigates the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics -- the landscape of accessible probability distributions over phase space. I prove a thermodynamic limitation on the information that can be obtained about a classical system by means of observations: A direct analogue of the Robertson-Schr\"odinger quantum uncertainty relation controls the acquisition of information at the classical microscale. Central to this theorem is the notion of the "quality" of a measuring probe; a temperature-dependent strictly positive quantity that serves as a figure of merit of the probe, and that plays the role of $1/\hbar$ in the classical uncertainty relation. This study sets the stage for a new area of research into resource theories of classical measurement, in which high-quality measurements and high-information states of knowledge are the limited resources.</description>

      <title>XY-Ashkin-Teller Phase Diagram in d=3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram of the Ashkin-Tellerized XY model in spatial dimension $d=3$ is calculated by renormalization-group theory. In this system, each site has two spins, each spin being an XY spin, that is having orientation continuously varying in 2\pi radians. Nearest-neighbor sites are coupled by two-spin and four-spin interactions. The phase diagram has ordered phases that are ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic in each of the spins, and phases that are ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic in the multiplicative spin variable. The phase diagram exhibits two symmetrically situated reverse bifurcation points of the phase boundaries. The renormalization-group flows are in terms of the doubly composite Fourier coefficients of the exponentiated energy of nearest-neighbor spins.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ $q$-state Potts model is solved exactly for arbitrary $q$, based on using OpenAI's latest reasoning model o3-mini-high to exactly solve the $q=3$ case. The exact results provide insights to outstanding physical problems such as the stacking of atomic or electronic orders in layered materials and the formation of a $T_c$-dome-shaped phase often seen in unconventional superconductors. The work is anticipated to fuel both the research in one-dimensional frustrated magnets for recently discovered finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic area of AI for sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a thermal bath that preserves the conservation of a system's angular momentum or allows it to fluctuate around a specified nonzero mean while maintaining a Boltzmann distribution of energy in the steady state.We demonstrate that classical particles immersed in such baths exhibit position-momentum uncertainties with a strictly positive lower bound proportional to the absolute value of the mean angular momentum. The proportionality constant, $c$, is dimensionless and independent of the system's parameters. Remarkably, while $c$ is universally bounded by unity, it attains the exact value $c=1/2$ for particles in central potentials.</description>

      <title>Chiral order emergence in the kagome $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model driven by site disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is know to exhibit a fascinating emergent $q=4$ Potts order (or $K_4$) due to the order-by-disorder mechanism: for large $J_3&gt;0$, fluctuations select one among the four equivalent collinear ground states, which themselves belong to a larger ground state manifold. We study this model with a rate $p$ of magnetic site vacancies through a numerical approach. First, we analyze the effect of few impurities on the ground state, favouring non-coplanar configurations. Second, for finite dilutions, we perform parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations in the $(T,p)$ plane, showing the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the $q=4$ Potts transition. This is a rare example of competing order parameters that exclude each other, whith the chiral one appearing only due to disorder.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom and Finite-size Scaling of Two-dimensional Classical Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Heisenberg model is one of the most fundamental models in statistical and condensed matter physics. Extensive theoretical and numerical studies suggest that, in two dimensions, this model does not exhibit a finite-temperature phase transition but instead manifests asymptotic freedom. However, some research has also proposed the possibility of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition over the years. In this study, we revisit the classical two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model through large-scale simulations with linear system sizes up to $L=16384$. Our Monte-Carlo data, without any extrapolation, clearly reveal an exponential divergence of the correlation length $\xi$ as a function of inverse temperature $\beta$, a hallmark of asymptotic freedom. Moreover, extrapolating $\xi$ to the thermodynamic limit in the low-temperature regime achieves close agreement with the three-loop perturbative calculations. We further propose a finite-size scaling (FSS) ansatz for $\xi$, demonstrating that the pseudo-critical point $\beta_L$ diverges logarithmically with $L$. The thermodynamic and finite-size scaling behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ are also investigated and corroborate the prediction of asymptotic freedom. Our work provides solid evidence for asymptotic freedom in the 2D Heisenberg model and advances understanding of finite-size scaling in such systems.</description>

      <title>Synergy of Doob Transformation and Montroll Defect Theory for Random Walks in External Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing stochastic processes by modifying simpler, analytically solvable random walks on discrete lattices. Our framework integrates the Doob $h$-transformation with the Montroll defect theory, overcoming the strict constraints associated with each method alone. By combining these two approaches, we map random walks in simple potentials onto processes involving more general external potentials and metastable states. Explicit analytical expressions relate the transformed process to the original one, facilitating direct investigation of exponential decay rates and additional dynamical modes. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate our method by analyzing a random walker in a linear potential modified to include a metastable state, revealing distinct exponential decay regimes relevant to escape dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Features of a Heat Engine Coupled with Exponentially Decreasing Temperature Across the Reaction Coordinate, as well as Perspectives on Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we advance the understanding of non-equilibrium systems by deriving thermodynamic relations for a heat engine operating under an exponentially decreasing temperature profile. Such thermal configurations closely mimic spatially localized heating such as laser-induced thermal gradients. Using exact analytical solutions, we show that this arrangement results in significantly higher velocity, entropy production, and extraction rates than piecewise thermal profiles, while exhibiting reduced irreversibility and complexity relative to linear or quadratic gradients. We further examine the thermodynamic behavior of the Brownian particles in the networks. Our study reveals that the velocity and entropy production rates remain independent of network size; on the contrary, extensive quantities such as total entropy depend on the number of microstates. Additionally, we show that a Brownian particle in a ratchet potential with spatially varying temperature achieves directed motion, even without external forces driven by solely thermal asymmetry. These findings highlight the critical role of temperature asymmetry in controlling the transport processes and optimizing the particle dynamics. This in turn will have promising applications in microfluidic devices and nanoscale sensors. Finally, we explore the influence of the system parameters on the efficiency and performance of the heat engine. The exponential temperature profiles enable faster velocities while simultaneously exhibiting higher efficiency compared with other thermal arrangements. Moreover, by addressing key questions on entropy production, we provide insights into the transition between nonequilibrium and equilibrium systems and contribute tools for optimizing energy-efficient systems in both natural and engineered settings.</description>

      <title>Single [2]catenanes in solution forming ${\sf 4}$-plats: a combined field theoretical and numerical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical mechanics of [2]catenanes in a solution with constrained number of maxima and minima along a special direction (the height) is discussed. The interest in this system comes from the fact that, in the homopolymer case, it has analogies with self-dual anyon field theory models and has conformations that minimize the static energy and bear particular symmetries and properties. In the first part of this work we provide a procedure for deriving the equations of motion in the case of replica field theories in the limit of zero replicas. We compute also the partition function of the [2]catenane at the lowest order in the frame of the so-called background field method. In the second part the statistical mechanics of the system is investigated using numerical simulations based on the Wang-Landau Monte Carlo method. At equilibrium, independently of the temperature, it turns out that the conformations of the system are elongated in the height directions. The two rings composing the [2]catenanes have approximately the same heights and are aligned. The thermodynamic properties of the system are discussed and the results coming from the field theoretical approach are compared with those of the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations of Local Topological Order Parameters in Disordered Two-dimensional Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and conductive edge states protected by the nontrivial topology of the bulk electronic structure. They remain robust against moderate disorder until Anderson localization occurs and destroys the topological phase. Interestingly, disorder can also induce a topological phase - known as a topological Anderson insulator - starting from an otherwise pristine trivial phase. While topological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue that space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters, revealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under Anderson disorder and vacancies. With this perspective, we perform numerical simulations of disorder-driven topological phase transitions in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models, using supercells with both open and periodic boundary conditions. We find that short-scale fluctuations of topological markers vanish upon coarse-graining, except at the topological phase transition, where their correlation length peaks and large-scale fluctuations remain.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>Structural Boundary State Transitions in Turbulent Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive optical measurements of canonical turbulent pipe flows have revealed the existence of structural boundary states (SBSs) -- near-wall low-speed streaks strongly correlated with pairs of counter-rotating quasi-streamwise vortices. In this study, we investigate the number fluctuations of these structures within the framework of statistical mechanics. Specifically, we introduce reduced degrees of freedom to model the low-speed streaks as a dilute lattice gas of hard-core particles. The Metropolis stochastic evolution provides, furthermore, a simple yet effective two-parameter model for describing SBS transitions. The lattice gas approach enables us to derive both the probability of SBS occurrence and the peculiar self-similar correlations that these structures exhibit along the streamwise direction. Our findings give additional support to the idea that the statistically stationary regimes of wall-bounded turbulent flows can be understood as Markov chains of coherent dynamical states in reduced-dimensional phase spaces.</description>

      <title>Penetration of surface effects on structural relaxation and particle hops in glassy films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23428v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two approaches towards supersymmetry: The ``conventional approach'', in which the fields appear in the classical action and the ``stochastic approach'', in which they emerge upon introducing in the action the contribution of a certain determinant. The second approach relies, in particular, on the so-called Nicolai map. The relation between the two approaches hasn't been clarified and the subject of this contribution is to spell it out. In particular the interpretation proposed by Parisi and Sourlas has remained quite incomplete. The subject of this contribution is to spell out in what way the two approaches complement each other and how the second can provide insights for the first.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V&lt; V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V&gt;V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.</description>

      <title>Feature learning from non-Gaussian inputs: the case of Independent Component Analysis in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks learn structured features from complex, non-Gaussian inputs, but the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. Our work is motivated by the observation that the first-layer filters learnt by deep convolutional neural networks from natural images resemble those learnt by independent component analysis (ICA), a simple unsupervised method that seeks the most non-Gaussian projections of its inputs. This similarity suggests that ICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning. Here, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data structure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA algorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to train deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least $n\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from $d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla online SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n \gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent way. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on ImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates for the poor sample complexity of FastICA.</description>

      <title>Deep Nets as Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</description>

      <title>Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</description>

      <title>Ranked percolation model for the caking time of amorphous molecular powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When amorphous molecular powders are exposed to high humidity levels or temperatures, the particle viscosity increases due to plasticization, promoting the formation of sinter bridges between pairs of particles in contact. Over time, these bridges facilitate particle agglomeration, eventually leading to the formation of a macroscopic cake that alters the mechanical properties and affects product quality. In this work, we model the caking process of amorphous powders subjected to a temperature shock as a bond percolation problem and investigate how particle bed heterogeneities influence the percolation threshold and, consequently, the expected caking times. Our findings indicate that a slight dispersion in particle size lowers the percolation threshold compared to a monodisperse bed or random percolation in polydisperse systems. Furthermore, we show that the expected caking time exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with the size dispersion, initially decreasing for low dispersion values and increasing for higher values. These results provide insights into the role of the particle size distribution on the caking dynamics of amorphous molecular powders</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of particulate composites derived from ultradense stealthy hyperuniform sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Insights of Domain Unfolding in Fibrin Mechanical Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibrinogen, the monomeric unit of fibrin, the main constituent of blood clot, has a very complex structure. The fibrinogen builds the fibrin fiber and network through the half-staggered packing via knob-hole interaction and the $\alpha$C crosslinkers. Due to its rich structure, the elastic behavior also shows a unique nature of very high stretchability and multiple regimes in stress-strain behaviour, which is not yet fully understood. We develop an Unfolding-incorporated Coarse-Grained Polymer (UCGP) model for fibrinogen to study the effect of domain unfolding on the mechanical behavior of fibrin fiber and network. Our model captures the stretching behavior of fibrinogen as observed in AFM and all-atom simulations. We further extend our model to fibrin fiber to study the effect of molecular unfolding at the fiber and network level. We anticipate that our model will be able to account for the nonlinear mechanical behavior of crosslinked fibrin gel. It is possibly the first model of this sort to consider the precise, controllable knowledge of the effects of domain unfolding in crosslinked proteins. This model can also be used to model systems that have sacrificial bonds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

Abstract: Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of a given outcome out of competitive events. This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler's ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out of equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to $d$-dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path towards the study of competitive events in complex media.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

Abstract: Chemical gradients provide the primordial energy for biological functions by driving the mechanical movement of microscopic engines. Their thermodynamic properties remain elusive, especially concerning the dynamic change in energy demand in biological systems. In this article, we derive a constraint relation between the output power and the conversion efficiency for a chemically fueled steady-state rotary motor analogous to the $\mathrm{F}_o$ motor of ATPase. We find that the efficiency at maximum power is half of the maximum quasi static efficiency. These findings shall aid in the understanding of natural chemical engines and inspire the manual design and control of chemically fueled microscale engines.</description>

      <title>A Graph Random Walk Method for Calculating Time-of-Flight Charge Mobility in Organic Semiconductors from Multiscale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. Our approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in terms of a sparse, linear system, avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional Master Equation or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.</description>

      <title>Ranking nodes in bipartite systems with a non-linear iterative map</title>

Abstract: Ranking nodes in networks according to a defined measure of importance is an extensively studied task, with applications in ecology, economic trade networks, and social networks. This paper introduces a method based on a non-linear iterative map to evaluate node relevance in bipartite networks. By tuning a single parameter $\gamma$, the method captures different concepts of node importance, including established measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and the fitness-complexity ranking. The algorithm's flexibility allows for efficient ranking optimization tailored to specific tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. We apply this method to ecological mutualistic networks, where ranking quality can be assessed by the extinction area - the rate at which the system collapses when species are removed in a certain order. The map with the optimal $\gamma$ value surpasses existing ranking methods on this task. Additionally, our method excels in evaluating nestedness, another crucial structural property of ecological systems, requiring specific node rankings. Finally, we explore theoretical aspects of the map, revealing a phase transition at a critical $\gamma$ dependent on the data structure that can be characterized analytically for random networks. Near the critical point, the map exhibits unique features and a distinctive "triangular" packing pattern of the incidence matrix.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Baxter-Wu model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu (BW) model under linear quenches. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density after exiting the impulse regime does not follow from a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening dynamics; the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form with an exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we show that, if the system starts from its ground state, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with an exponential decay of the excess defect density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the defect density exhibits a good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism.</description>

Abstract: The main mechanisms and conditions of interaction of lava-like fuel-containing materials (LFCM) with the atmosphere, water and aqueous solutions are presented. The mechanisms of destruction of the LFCM surface, including ion-exchange processes, hydrolysis, dissolution, oxidation, etc., were analyzed. Inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients for UO$_{2}^{2+}$, Cs$^{+}$ ions at the interface "aqueous solution of radioactive elements - LFCM" were calculated. The interdiffusion processes and the rate of penetration into the porous medium of the reaction front of the internal hydrolysis of the silicon-oxygen network during interaction with an aqueous solution were analyzed, where the reaction and adsorption processes are hidden in the rate of internal hydrolysis.</description>

Abstract: Resent achievements in statistical theory, namely, a possibility to reproduce almost unlimited Mayer's activity series based on the information about their convergence radius, on the one hand, and generalization of the lattice statistics by eliminating the simplification of nearest-neighbor interactions, on the other hand, have allowed accurate quantitative description of the condensation in lattice gases, spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnets, and spinodal decomposition in binary mixtures by evaluating only several irreducible cluster integrals (virial coefficients). In particular, the results of calculations indicate qualitative and even quantitative universality in the behavior of the mentioned lattice systems of different geometry and dimensionality at the same values of a certain reduced temperature when that behavior is expressed in terms of some dimensionless parameters. An additional possibility to describe the order-disorder phase transitions in some other lattice systems (e.g., antiferromagnets and alloys) is also discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Entropy of a restricted primitive model electrolyte using a mean electrostatic potential approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excess entropy of restricted primitive model electrolytes is calculated using a potential based approach through the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. The theories are utilized in conjunction with a statistical thermodynamics equation that is shown to be equivalent to thermodynamic integration. Electrolyte systems having ionic valencies 1:1 and 2:2 with diameters $3 \times 10^{-10}$~m and 4.25 $\times 10^{-10}$ m are treated over a wide range of concentrations. The exact radial distribution functions for the model electrolytes obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble are compared with the corresponding theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions from the theories and the simulations are used in the Laird-Haymet entropy expansion equations [J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3775] to estimate the excess entropy of the solutions. These equations take into account multi-particle distribution functions, which are approximated using a ``ring'' term. In general, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives results that are more consistent with the simulation data than those from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The results show that the excess entropy is negative with its absolute value increasing for 1:1 electrolytes with increasing concentration. The symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly overestimated, while the modified Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly underestimated relative to the simulations. The curves for 1:1 electrolytes including that from the Laird-Haymet equations are consistent with each other, while only the MPB curves for 2:2 electrolytes at $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m are qualitative relative to the simulations up to about 1 mol/dm$^{3}$. The 2:2 electrolyte curves reveal a characteristic inflection and plateau....</description>

      <title>Renormalization group analysis reveals universality classes of stochastic spiking neuron networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuits may operate close to ``critical points'' -- boundaries between different phases of collective activity. This has been argued to have functional benefits for neural computation. Studies investigating whether neural circuits are poised near critical points have largely relied on establishing power laws in neural data, while a fundamental understanding of critical phenomena requires a renormalization group (RG) analysis. However, neural activity is typically non-Gaussian, nonlinear, and non-local, rendering models that capture all of these features difficult to study using standard statistical physics techniques. We overcome these issues and adapt the non-perturbative renormalization group (NPRG) to provide the first RG analysis of networks of stochastic spiking neurons. We show that neural populations can belong to at least two important universality classes: 1) in networks with an absorbing state there is a transition between sustained and extinguished activity that belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and 2) in spontaneously active networks there is a continuous transition between high and low firing rate states that belongs to the Ising model universality class. We verify our theoretical results by simulating the network model on lattices in $2$ and $3$ dimensions, recovering known exponents, and then investigate critical phenomena in networks of sparsely-connected excitatory neurons and densely-connected inhibitory neurons. Depending on the amount of inhibitory feedback, these networks may display mean-field exponents or anomalous exponents close to -- but potentially not equal to -- lattices of the same effective dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. To address this limitation, we introduce a theoretical framework that leverages latent directions in input space, which can be related to contextual information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent manifold capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation reformatting in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work is a continuation of our previous paper [Condens. Matter Phys., 2020, 23, 33602: 1-17]. It is devoted to the modelling of the interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. The modelling of equilibrium phase transition is based on the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation. The non-equilibrium phase transition is modeled by the Second Schl\"ogl reaction system. We consider the advancing front, which combines these both transitions. Different from the first article, we consider here the memory effects, i.e., the effects of non-Fickian diffusion. The traveling wave solution is obtained, and its dependence on the model parameters is studied in detail. The relative importance of memory effects for different process regimes is estimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</description>

      <title>Precritical anomalous scaling and magnetization temperature dependence in cubic ferromagnetic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in spintronics have drawn renewed attention to the spin dynamics of cubic ferromagnetic crystals EuO and EuS. These ferromagnets have the simplest possible magnetic structure, making them the most suitable systems for testing various theoretical models of magnetic materials. A commonly used Weiss mean-field approximation (MFA) provides only a qualitative description of the magnetization temperature dependence $M(T)$. We develop a consistent theory for $M(T)$ based on the perturbation diagrammatic technique for spin operators. Our theory is in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental dependence of $M(T)$ for EuO and EuS throughout the entire temperature range from $T=0$ to Curie temperature $T_{C}$. In particular, our theoretical dependence $M(T)$ demonstrates a scaling behavior $M(T)\propto (T_{C}-T)^{\beta_*}$ with the scaling index $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ in a wide range of temperatures in agreement with the experimentally observed apparent scaling in EuO and EuS. The scaling behavior with $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ is manifested in the temperature range $T\lesssim T_{C}$ where corrections to the magnetization due to its fluctuations $\delta M (T)\lesssim M(T)$. To distinguish it from the narrow ``critical" range $T\approx T_{C}$ with $\delta M (T) &gt; M(T)$, we term this $T$-range ``precritical". The precritical corrections $\delta M (T)$ are still large enough to affect the $M(T)$ behavior. The index $\beta_*$ fundamentally differs from the ``normal" scaling index $\beta_{MFA}=1/2$ predicted by the MFA, which neglects the magnetization fluctuations. We refer to the emerging in our theory apparent magnetization scaling with $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ as ``precritical anomalous".</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of Ising-nematic order in a frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase ordering dynamics of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ (nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings) Heisenberg model on the square lattice in the strong frustration regime ($J_2/J_1 &gt; 1/2$). While thermal fluctuations preclude any long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, the system exhibits a long-range spin-driven nematic phase at low temperatures. The transition into the nematic phase is further shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class based on the critical exponents near the phase transition. Our large-scale stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations find a two-stage phase ordering when the system is quenched from a high-temperature paramagnetic state into the nematic phase. In the early stage, collinear alignments of spins lead to a locally saturated Ising-nematic order. Once domains of well-defined Ising order are developed, the late-stage relaxation is dominated by curvature-driven domain coarsening, as described by the Allen-Cahn equation. The characteristic size of Ising-nematic domains scales as the square root of time, similar to the kinetic Ising model described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our results confirm that the late-stage ordering kinetics of the spin-driven nematic, which is a vestigial order of the frustrated Heisenberg model, belongs to the dynamical universality class of a non-conserved Ising order. Interestingly, the system shows no violation of the superuniversality hypothesis under weak bond disorder. The dynamic scaling invariance is preserved in the presence of weak bond disorder. We also discuss possible applications of our results to materials for which vestigial Ising-nematic order is realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>

Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>Don't look back: Ordering and defect cloaking in non-reciprocal lattice XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analytical and numerical examination, on square and triangular lattices, of the non-reciprocal planar spin model introduced in Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020). We show that the effect of lattice anisotropy should persist at large scales, leading to a ``mass'' for the angle field of the spins, and behaviour not in the ``Malthusian Toner-Tu'' universality class. Numerically, we find evidence of this mass at large values of our non-reciprocity parameter; for smaller values, we find power-law scaling of long-wavelength equal-time correlators in the polar-ordered phase of our lattice model over the system sizes and wavenumber range explored. Focussing on topological defects, we show numerically that defect interactions are highly anisotropic with respect to the mean ordering direction. In particular, the constituents of a $\pm 1$ pair are shielded from each other in a class of configurations, deferring their annihilation and allowing time for the nucleation of further defects. The result, we show numerically, is the destruction of the polarised phase via an aster apocalypse reminiscent of that found by Besse et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 268003 (2022), for the Malthusian Toner-Tu equation.</description>

      <title>The inconvenient truth about flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reanalyze the hydrodynamic theory of "flocks" that is, polar ordered "dry" active fluids in two dimensions. For "Malthusian" flocks, in which birth and death cause the density to relax quickly, thereby eliminating density as a hydrodynamic variable, we are able to obtain two exact scaling laws relating the three scaling exponents characterizing the long-distance properties of these systems. We also show that it is highly plausible that such flocks display long-range order in two dimensions. In addition, we demonstrate that for "immortal" flocks, in which the number of flockers is conserved, the extra non-linearities allowed by the presence of an extra slow variable (number density) make it impossible to obtain any exact scaling relations between the exponents. We thereby demonstrate that several past published claims of exact exponents for Malthusian and immortal flocks are all incorrect.</description>

      <title>The Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy.
  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</description>
