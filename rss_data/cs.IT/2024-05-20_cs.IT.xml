      <title>Next-slot OFDM-CSI Prediction: Multi-head Self-attention or State Space Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing fifth-generation (5G) standardization is exploring the use of deep learning (DL) methods to enhance the new radio (NR) interface. Both in academia and industry, researchers are investigating the performance and complexity of multiple DL architecture candidates for specific one-sided and two-sided use cases such as channel state estimation (CSI) feedback, CSI prediction, beam management, and positioning. In this paper, we set focus on the CSI prediction task and study the performance and generalization of the two main DL layers that are being extensively benchmarked within the DL community, namely, multi-head self-attention (MSA) and state-space model (SSM). We train and evaluate MSA and SSM layers to predict the next slot for uplink and downlink communication scenarios over urban microcell (UMi) and urban macrocell (UMa) OFDM 5G channel models. Our numerical results demonstrate that SSMs exhibit better prediction and generalization capabilities than MSAs only for SISO cases. For MIMO scenarios, however, the MSA layer outperforms the SSM one. While both layers represent potential DL architectures for future DL-enabled 5G use cases, the overall investigation of this paper favors MSAs over SSMs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Update Policy for the Monitoring of Distributed Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When making decisions in a network, it is important to have up-to-date knowledge of the current state of the system. Obtaining this information, however, comes at a cost. In this paper, we determine the optimal finite-time update policy for monitoring the binary states of remote sources with a reporting rate constraint. We first prove an upper and lower bound of the minimal probability of error before solving the problem analytically. The error probability is defined as the probability that the system performs differently than it would with full system knowledge. More specifically, an error occurs when the destination node incorrectly determines which top-K priority sources are in the ``free'' state. We find that the optimal policy follows a specific ordered 3-stage update pattern. We then provide the optimal transition points for each stage for each source.</description>

      <title>On the Rate-Distortion Function for Sampled Cyclostationary Gaussian Processes with Memory: Extended Version with Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the rate-distortion function (RDF) for lossy compression of asynchronously-sampled continuous-time (CT) wide-sense cyclostationary (WSCS) Gaussian processes with memory. As the case of synchronous sampling, i.e., when the sampling interval is commensurate with the period of the cyclostationary statistics, has already been studied, we focus on discrete-time (DT) processes obtained by asynchronous sampling, i.e., when the sampling interval is incommensurate with the period of the cyclostationary statistics of the CT WSCS source process. It is further assumed that the sampling interval is smaller than the maximal autocorrelation length of the CT source process, which implies that the DT process possesses memory. Thus, the sampled process is a DT wide-sense almost cyclostationary (WSACS) processes with memory. This problem is motivated by the fact that man-made communications signals are modelled as CT WSCS processes; hence, applications of such sampling include, e.g., compress-and-forward relaying and recording systems. The main challenge follows because, with asynchronous sampling, the DT sampled process is not information-stable, and hence the characterization of its RDF should be carried out within the information-spectrum framework instead of using conventional information-theoretic arguments. This work expands upon our previous work which addressed the special case in which the DT process is independent across time. The existence of dependence between the samples requires new tools to obtain the characterization of the RDF.</description>

      <title>On Performance of FAS-aided Wireless Powered NOMA Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) under the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, where users take advantage of an emerging fluid antenna system (FAS). More precisely, we consider a scenario where a transmitter is powered by a remote power beacon (PB) to send information to the planar NOMA FAS-equipped users through Rayleigh fading channels. After introducing the distribution of the equivalent channel coefficients to the users, we derive compact analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) in order to evaluate the system performance. Additionally, we present asymptotic OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Eventually, results reveal that deploying the FAS with only one activated port in NOMA users can significantly enhance the WPCN performance compared with using traditional antenna systems (TAS).</description>

      <title>R-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Modeling RIS-enabled Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, ray tracing has gained renewed interest with the advent of Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology, a key enabler of 6G wireless communications due to its capability of intelligent manipulation of electromagnetic waves. However, accurately modeling RIS-enabled wireless environments poses significant challenges due to the complex variations caused by various environmental factors and the mobility of RISs. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling approach using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to characterize the dynamics of electromagnetic fields in such environments. Our method utilizes NeRF-based ray tracing to intuitively capture and visualize the complex dynamics of signal propagation, effectively modeling the complete signal pathways from the transmitter to the RIS, and from the RIS to the receiver. This two-stage process accurately characterizes multiple complex transmission paths, enhancing our understanding of signal behavior in real-world scenarios. Our approach predicts the signal field for any specified RIS placement and receiver location, facilitating efficient RIS deployment. Experimental evaluations using both simulated and real-world data validate the significant benefits of our methodology.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Association and Feedback Bit Allocation for FDD Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to user-centric association and feedback bit allocation for the downlink of a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system, operating under limited feedback constraints. In CF-mMIMO systems employing frequency division duplexing, each access point (AP) relies on channel information provided by its associated user equipments (UEs) for beamforming design. Since the uplink control channel is typically shared among UEs, we take account of each AP's total feedback budget, which is distributed among its associated UEs. By employing the Saleh-Valenzuela multi-resolvable path channel model with different average path gains, we first identify necessary feedback information for each UE, along with an appropriate codebook structure. This structure facilitates adaptive quantization of multiple paths based on their dominance. We then formulate a joint optimization problem addressing user-centric UE-AP association and feedback bit allocation. To address this challenge, we analyze the impact of feedback bit allocation and derive our proposed scheme from the solution of an alternative optimization problem aimed at devising long-term policies, explicitly considering the effects of feedback bit allocation. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme effectively enhances the performance of conventional approaches in CF-mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized regenerating codes and node repair on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider regenerating codes in distributed storage systems where connections between the nodes are constrained by a graph. In this problem, the failed node downloads the information stored at a subset of vertices of the graph for the purpose of recovering the lost data. Compared to the standard setting, regenerating codes on graphs address two additional features. The repair information is moved across the network, and the cost of node repair is determined by the graphical distance from the helper nodes to the failed node. Accordingly, the helpers far away from the failed node may be expected to contribute less data for repair than the nodes in the neighborhood of that node. We analyze regenerating codes with nonuniform download for repair on graphs. Moreover, in the process of repair, the information moved from the helpers to the failed node may be combined through intermediate processing, reducing the repair bandwidth. We derive lower bounds for communication complexity of node repair on graphs, including repair schemes with nonuniform download and intermediate processing, and construct codes that attain these bounds.
  Additionally, some of the nodes may act as adversaries, introducing errors into the data moved in the network. For repair on graphs in the presence of adversarial nodes, we construct codes that support node repair and error correction in systematic nodes.</description>

      <title>Finite Field Multiple Access for Sourced Massive Random Access with Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For binary source transmission, this paper proposes an element-pair (EP) coding scheme for supporting sourced massive random access, which is used to solve the finite blocklength (FBL) of multiuser reliability transmission problem. In this paper, we first give the definition of an EP, which is used as a virtual resource. If the Cartesian product of $J$ distinct EPs satisfies the unique sum-pattern mapping (USPM) structural property, the $J$ distinct EPs can form an uniquely-decodable EP (UD-EP) code. Then, we introduce a type of orthogonal EP code $\Psi_{\rm o, B}$ constructed over an extension field GF($2^m$). Based on the proposed EP code, we present finite-field multiple-access (FFMA) systems, including both the sparse-form-based and diagonal-form-based forms. Simulation results show that, for the massive random access scenario, the error performance of the proposed FFMA systems over a Gaussian multiple-access channel can provide much better error performance than that of a slotted ALOHA system.</description>

      <title>A Rate-Distortion Analysis for Composite Sources Under Subsource-Dependent Fidelity Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A composite source, consisting of multiple subsources and a memoryless switch, outputs one symbol at a time from the subsource selected by the switch. If some data should be encoded more accurately than other data from an information source, the composite source model is suitable because in this model different distortion constraints can be put on the subsources. In this context, we propose subsource-dependent fidelity criteria for composite sources and use them to formulate a rate-distortion problem. We solve the problem and obtain a single-letter expression for the rate-distortion function. Further rate-distortion analysis characterizes the performance of classify-then-compress (CTC) coding, which is frequently used in practice when subsource-dependent fidelity criteria are considered. Our analysis shows that CTC coding generally has performance loss relative to optimal coding, even if the classification is perfect. We also identify the cause of the performance loss, that is, class labels have to be reproduced in CTC coding. Last but not least, we show that the performance loss is negligible for asymptotically small distortion if CTC coding is appropriately designed and some mild conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous MIMO-OFDM Massive Unsourced Random Access with Codeword Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates asynchronous MIMO massive unsourced random access in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system over frequency-selective fading channels, with the presence of both timing and carrier frequency offsets (TO and CFO) and non-negligible codeword collisions. The proposed coding framework segregates the data into two components, namely, preamble and coding parts, with the former being tree-coded and the latter LDPC-coded. By leveraging the dual sparsity of the equivalent channel across both codeword and delay domains (CD and DD), we develop a message passing-based sparse Bayesian learning algorithm, combined with belief propagation and mean field, to iteratively estimate DD channel responses, TO, and delay profiles. Furthermore, we establish a novel graph-based algorithm to iteratively separate the superimposed channels and compensate for the phase rotations. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is applied to the flat fading scenario to estimate both TO and CFO, where the channel and offset estimation is enhanced by leveraging the geometric characteristics of the signal constellation. Simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance and substantial complexity reduction in both channel and offset estimation compared to the codebook enlarging-based counterparts, and enhanced data recovery performances compared to state-of-the-art URA schemes.</description>

      <title>Max-Min Fairness and PHY-Layer Design of Uplink MIMO Rate-Splitting Multiple Access with Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a potent and reliable multiple access and interference management technique in wireless communications. While downlink Multiple-Input Multiple-Ouput (MIMO) RSMA has been widely investigated, uplink MIMO RSMA has not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the performance of uplink RSMA in short-packet communications with perfect Channel State Information at Transmitter (CSIT) and Channel State Information at Receiver (CSIR). We propose an uplink MIMO RSMA framework and optimize both precoders and combiners with Max-Min Fairness (MMF) metric and Finite Blocklength (FBL) constraints. Due to the high coupling between precoders and combiners, we apply the Alternating Optimization (AO) to decompose the optimization problem into two subproblems. To tackle these subproblems, we propose a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)-based approach. Additionally, we introduce a low-complexity scheme to design the decoding order at the receiver. Subsequently, the Physical (PHY)-layer of the uplink MIMO RSMA architecture is designed and evaluated using multi-user Link-Level Simulations (LLS), accounting for finite constellation modulation, finite length polar codes, message splitting, adaptive modulation and coding, and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Numerical results demonstrate that applying RSMA in uplink MIMO with FBL constraints not only achieves MMF gains over conventional transmission schemes such as Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) but also exhibits robustness to network loads. The benefits of splitting messages from multiple users are also illustrated. LLS results confirm the improved max-min throughput benefits of RSMA over SDMA and NOMA.</description>

      <title>Enzymatic cycle-based receivers with high input impedance for approximate maximum a posteriori demodulation of concentration modulated signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication is a bio-inspired communication paradigm where molecules are used as the information carrier. This paper considers a molecular communication network where the transmitter uses concentration modulated signals for communication. Our focus is to design receivers that can demodulate these signals. We impose three features on our receivers. We want the receivers to use enzymatic cycles as their building blocks, have high input impedance and can work approximately as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) demodulator. No receivers with all these three features exist in the current molecular communication literature. We consider enzymatic cycles because they are a very common class of chemical reactions that are found in living cells. Since a receiver is to be placed in the communication environment, it should ideally have a high input impedance so that it has minimal impact on the environment and on other receivers. Lastly, a MAP receiver has good statistical performance. In this paper, we show how we can use time-scale separation to make an enzymatic cycle to have high input impedance and how the parameters of the enzymatic cycles can be chosen so that the receiver can approximately implement a MAP demodulator. We use simulation to study the performance of this receiver. In particular, we consider an environment with multiple receivers and show that a receiver has little impact on the bit error ratio of a nearby receiver because they have high input impedance.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Communication for Networked Control Assisted by Reconfigurable Meta-Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for goal-oriented communication assisted by reconfigurable meta-surfaces in the context of networked control systems. The relation to goal-oriented communication stems from the fact that optimization of the phase shifts of the meta-surfaces is guided by the performance of networked control systems tasks. To that end, we consider a networked control system in which a set of sensors observe the states of a set of physical processes, and communicate this information over an unreliable wireless channel assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface with multiple reflecting elements to a set of controllers that correct the behaviors of the physical processes based on the received information. Our objective is to find the optimal control policy for the controllers and the optimal phase policy for the reconfigurable intelligent surface that jointly minimize a regulation cost function associated with the networked control system. We characterize these policies, and also propose an approximate solution based on a semi-definite relaxation technique.</description>

      <title>Embracing Radiance Field Rendering in 6G: Over-the-Air Training and Inference with 3D Contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient representation, transmission, and reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) contents are becoming increasingly important for sixth-generation (6G) networks that aim to merge virtual and physical worlds for offering immersive communication experiences. Neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have recently emerged as two promising 3D representation techniques based on radiance field rendering, which are able to provide photorealistic rendering results for complex scenes. Therefore, embracing NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G networks is envisioned to be a prominent solution to support emerging 3D applications with enhanced quality of experience. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on the integration of NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G. First, we review the basics of the radiance field rendering techniques, and highlight their applications and implementation challenges over wireless networks. Next, we consider the over-the-air training of NeRF and 3D-GS models over wireless networks by presenting various learning techniques. We particularly focus on the federated learning design over a hierarchical device-edge-cloud architecture. Then, we discuss three practical rendering architectures of NeRF and 3D-GS models at wireless network edge. We provide model compression approaches to facilitate the transmission of radiance field models, and present rendering acceleration approaches and joint computation and communication designs to enhance the rendering efficiency. In particular, we propose a new semantic communication enabled 3D content transmission design, in which the radiance field models are exploited as the semantic knowledge base to reduce the communication overhead for distributed inference. Furthermore, we present the utilization of radiance field rendering in wireless applications like radio mapping and radio imaging.</description>

      <title>WiDRa -- Enabling Millimeter-Level Differential Ranging Accuracy in Wi-Fi Using Carrier Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Wi-Fi is an ideal technology for many ranging applications, the performance of current methods is limited by the system bandwidth, leading to low accuracy of $\sim 1$ m. For many applications, measuring differential range, viz., the change in the range between adjacent measurements, is sufficient. Correspondingly, this work proposes WiDRa - a Wi-Fi based Differential Ranging solution that provides differential range estimates by using the sum-carrier-phase information. The proposed method is not limited by system bandwidth and can track range changes even smaller than the carrier wavelength. The proposed method is first theoretically justified, while taking into consideration the various hardware impairments affecting Wi-Fi chips. In the process, methods to isolate the sum-carrier phase from the hardware impairments are proposed. Extensive simulation results show that WiDRa can achieve a differential range estimation root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of $\approx 1$ mm in channels with a Rician-factor $\geq 7$ (a $100 \times$ improvement to existing methods). The proposed methods are also validated on off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware to demonstrate feasibility, where they achieve an RMSE of $&lt; 1$ mm in the differential range. Finally, limitations of current investigation and future directions of exploration are suggested, to further tap into the potential of WiDRa.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Relative Entropy Coding with Space Partitioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms encode a random sample following a target distribution $Q$, using a coding distribution $P$ shared between the sender and receiver. Sadly, general REC algorithms suffer from prohibitive encoding times, at least on the order of $2^{D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]}$, and faster algorithms are limited to very specific settings. This work addresses this issue by introducing a REC scheme utilizing space partitioning to reduce runtime in practical scenarios. We provide theoretical analyses of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness with both toy examples and practical applications. Notably, our method successfully handles REC tasks with $D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]$ about three times what previous methods can manage and reduces the compression rate by approximately 5-15\% in VAE-based lossless compression on MNIST and INR-based lossy compression on CIFAR-10 compared to previous methods, significantly improving the practicality of REC for neural compression.</description>

Abstract: Counterfactuals, or modified inputs that lead to a different outcome, are an important tool for understanding the logic used by machine learning classifiers and how to change an undesirable classification. Even if a counterfactual changes a classifier's decision, however, it may not affect the true underlying class probabilities, i.e. the counterfactual may act like an adversarial attack and ``fool'' the classifier. We propose a new framework for creating modified inputs that change the true underlying probabilities in a beneficial way which we call Trustworthy Actionable Perturbations (TAP). This includes a novel verification procedure to ensure that TAP change the true class probabilities instead of acting adversarially. Our framework also includes new cost, reward, and goal definitions that are better suited to effectuating change in the real world. We present PAC-learnability results for our verification procedure and theoretically analyze our new method for measuring reward. We also develop a methodology for creating TAP and compare our results to those achieved by previous counterfactual methods.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Compression with Implicit Neural Representations: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point clouds have become increasingly vital across various applications thanks to their ability to realistically depict 3D objects and scenes. Nevertheless, effectively compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a pioneering point cloud compression framework capable of handling both geometry and attribute components. Unlike traditional approaches and existing learning-based methods, our framework utilizes two coordinate-based neural networks to implicitly represent a voxelized point cloud. The first network generates the occupancy status of a voxel, while the second network determines the attributes of an occupied voxel. To tackle an immense number of voxels within the volumetric space, we partition the space into smaller cubes and focus solely on voxels within non-empty cubes. By feeding the coordinates of these voxels into the respective networks, we reconstruct the geometry and attribute components of the original point cloud. The neural network parameters are further quantized and compressed. Experimental results underscore the superior performance of our proposed method compared to the octree-based approach employed in the latest G-PCC standards. Moreover, our method exhibits high universality when contrasted with existing learning-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Learning Regularities from Data using Spiking Functions: A Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner are proven to be efficient in a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, there is one drawback of end-to-end learning: The learned features and information are implicitly represented in neural network parameters, which cannot be used as regularities, concepts or knowledge to explicitly represent the data probability distribution. To resolve this issue, we propose in this paper a new machine learning theory, which defines in mathematics what are regularities. Briefly, regularities are concise representations of the non-random features, or 'non-randomness' in the data probability distribution. Combining with information theory, we claim that regularities can also be regarded as a small amount of information encoding a large amount of information. Our theory is based on spiking functions. That is, if a function can react to, or spike on specific data samples more frequently than random noise inputs, we say that such a function discovers non-randomness from the data distribution, and encodes the non-randomness into regularities. Our theory also discusses applying multiple spiking functions to the same data distribution. In this process, we claim that the 'best' regularities, or the optimal spiking functions, are those who can capture the largest amount of information from the data distribution, and then encode the captured information in the most concise way. Theorems and hypotheses are provided to describe in mathematics what are 'best' regularities and optimal spiking functions. Finally, we propose a machine learning approach, which can potentially obtain the optimal spiking functions regarding the given dataset in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem studied in this work is to determine the higher weight spectra of the Projective Reed-Muller codes associated to the Veronese $3$-fold $\mathcal V$ in $PG(9,q)$, which is the image of the quadratic Veronese embedding of $PG(3,q)$ in $PG(9,q)$. We reduce the problem to the following combinatorial problem in finite geometry: For each subset $S$ of $\mathcal V$, determine the dimension of the linear subspace of $PG(9,q)$ generated by $S$. We develop a systematic method to solve the latter problem. We implement the method for $q=3$, and use it to obtain the higher weight spectra of the associated code. The case of a general finite field $\mathbb F_q$ will be treated in a future work.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Federated Edge Learning with Streaming Data: A Lyapunov Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has received significant attention in recent years for its advantages in efficient training of machine learning models across distributed clients without disclosing user-sensitive data. Specifically, in federated edge learning (FEEL) systems, the time-varying nature of wireless channels introduces inevitable system dynamics in the communication process, thereby affecting training latency and energy consumption. In this work, we further consider a streaming data scenario where new training data samples are randomly generated over time at edge devices. Our goal is to develop a dynamic scheduling and resource allocation algorithm to address the inherent randomness in data arrivals and resource availability under long-term energy constraints. To achieve this, we formulate a stochastic network optimization problem and use the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework to obtain a dynamic resource management design. Our proposed algorithm makes adaptive decisions on device scheduling, computational capacity adjustment, and allocation of bandwidth and transmit power in every round. We provide convergence analysis for the considered setting with heterogeneous data and time-varying objective functions, which supports the rationale behind our proposed scheduling design. The effectiveness of our scheme is verified through simulation results, demonstrating improved learning performance and energy efficiency as compared to baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Structure from a Bottleneck on Sequential Information Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human language is a unique form of communication in the natural world, distinguished by its structured nature. Most fundamentally, it is systematic, meaning that signals can be broken down into component parts that are individually meaningful -- roughly, words -- which are combined in a regular way to form sentences. Furthermore, the way in which these parts are combined maintains a kind of locality: words are usually concatenated together, and they form contiguous phrases, keeping related parts of sentences close to each other. We address the challenge of understanding how these basic properties of language arise from broader principles of efficient communication under information processing constraints. Here we show that natural-language-like systematicity arises from minimization of excess entropy, a measure of statistical complexity that represents the minimum amount of information necessary for predicting the future of a sequence based on its past. In simulations, we show that codes that minimize excess entropy factorize their source distributions into approximately independent components, and then express those components systematically and locally. Next, in a series of massively cross-linguistic corpus studies, we show that human languages are structured to have low excess entropy at the level of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Our result suggests that human language performs a sequential generalization of Independent Components Analysis on the statistical distribution over meanings that need to be expressed. It establishes a link between the statistical and algebraic structure of human language, and reinforces the idea that the structure of human language may have evolved to minimize cognitive load while maximizing communicative expressiveness.</description>

      <title>Computability of the Zero-Error Capacity of Noisy Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.06873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-error capacity plays an important role in a whole range of operational tasks, in addition to the fact that it is necessary for practical applications. Due to the importance of zero-error capacity, it is necessary to investigate its algorithmic computability, as there has been no known closed formula for the zero-error capacity until now. We show that the zero-error capacity of noisy channels is not Banach-Mazur computable and therefore not Borel-Turing computable. We also investigate the relationship between the zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels, the Shannon capacity of graphs, and Ahlswede's characterization of the zero-error-capacity of noisy channels with respect to the maximum error capacity of 0-1-arbitrarily varying channels. We will show that important questions regarding semi-decidability are equivalent for all three capacities. So far, the Borel-Turing computability of the Shannon capacity of graphs is completely open. This is why the coupling with semi-decidability is interesting.</description>

Abstract: The channel reliability function is an important tool that characterizes the reliable transmission of messages over communication channels. For many channels, only upper and lower bounds of the function are known. We analyze the computability of the reliability function and its related functions. We show that the reliability function is not a Turing computable performance function. The same also applies to the functions related to the sphere packing bound and the expurgation bound. Furthermore, we consider the $R_\infty$ function and the zero-error feedback capacity, since they play an important role in the context of the reliability function. Both the $R_\infty$ function and the zero-error feedback capacity are not Banach Mazur computable.</description>

      <title>MARS: Message Passing for Antenna and RF Chain Selection for Hybrid Beamforming in MIMO Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a prospective receiving hybrid beamforming structure consisting of several radio frequency (RF) chains and abundant antenna elements in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Due to conventional costly full connections, we design an enhanced partially connected beamformer employing a low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based structure. As a benefit of the LDPC-based structure, information can be exchanged among clustered RF/antenna groups, which results in a low computational complexity order. Advanced message passing (MP) capable of inferring and transferring information among different paths is designed to support the LDPC-based hybrid beamformer. We propose a message-passing enhanced antenna and RF chain selection (MARS) scheme for minimizing the operational power of antennas and RF chains of the receiver as well as hybrid beamforming. Furthermore, sequential and parallel MP schemes for MARS are designed, namely, MARS-S and MARS-P, respectively, to address the convergence speed issue. A heuristic genetic algorithm is designed for receiving hybrid beamforming, comprising gene generation initialization, elite selection, crossover, and mutation. Simulations validate the convergence of both the MARS-P and the MARS-S algorithms. Due to the asynchronous information transfer of MARS-P, it requires higher power than MARS-S, which strikes a compelling balance among power consumption, convergence, and computational complexity. It is also demonstrated that the proposed MARS scheme outperforms the existing benchmarks using the heuristic method of fully/partially connected architectures in the open literature by requiring the lowest power and realizing the highest energy efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes novel approaches that jointly design user equipment (UE) association and power control (PC) in a downlink user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) network, where each UE is only served by a set of access points (APs) for reducing the fronthaul signalling and computational complexity. In order to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs, we formulate a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem under constraints on the per-AP transmit power, quality-of-service rate requirements, maximum fronthaul signalling load, and maximum number of UEs served by each AP. In order to solve the formulated problem efficiently, we propose two different schemes according to the different sizes of the CFmMIMO systems. For small-scale CFmMIMO systems, we present a successive convex approximation (SCA) method to obtain a stationary solution and also develop a learning-based method (JointCFNet) to reduce the computational complexity. For large-scale CFmMIMO systems, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm using accelerated projected gradient (APG) techniques. Numerical results show that our JointCFNet can yield similar performance and significantly decrease the run time compared with the SCA algorithm in small-scale systems. The presented APG approach is confirmed to run much faster than the SCA algorithm in the large-scale system while obtaining an SE performance close to that of the SCA approach. Moreover, the median sum SE of the APG method is up to about 2.8 fold higher than that of the heuristic baseline scheme.</description>

      <title>When to Preempt in a Status Update System?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted status update system with an error-free preemptive queue. The goal of the sampler-scheduler pair is to minimize the age of information at the monitor by sampling and transmitting the freshly sampled update packets to the monitor. The sampler-scheduler pair also has a choice to preempt an old update packet from the server and transmit a new update packet to the server. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and find the optimal sampling policy. We find a sufficient, and also separately a necessary, condition for the always preemption policy to be an optimal policy. We show that it is optimal for the sampler-scheduler pair to sample a new packet immediately upon the reception of an update packet at the monitor. We propose a double-threshold sampling policy which we show to be an optimal policy under some assumptions on the queue statistic.</description>

      <title>RSCNet: Dynamic CSI Compression for Cloud-based WiFi Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WiFi-enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are evolving from mere communication devices to sensing instruments, leveraging Channel State Information (CSI) extraction capabilities. Nevertheless, resource-constrained IoT devices and the intricacies of deep neural networks necessitate transmitting CSI to cloud servers for sensing. Although feasible, this leads to considerable communication overhead. In this context, this paper develops a novel Real-time Sensing and Compression Network (RSCNet) which enables sensing with compressed CSI; thereby reducing the communication overheads. RSCNet facilitates optimization across CSI windows composed of a few CSI frames. Once transmitted to cloud servers, it employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to harness data from prior windows, thus bolstering both the sensing accuracy and CSI reconstruction. RSCNet adeptly balances the trade-off between CSI compression and sensing precision, thus streamlining real-time cloud-based WiFi sensing with reduced communication costs. Numerical findings demonstrate the gains of RSCNet over the existing benchmarks like SenseFi, showcasing a sensing accuracy of 97.4% with minimal CSI reconstruction error. Numerical results also show a computational analysis of the proposed RSCNet as a function of the number of CSI frames.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding Next Generation Multiple Access Using Physical Layer Security Techniques: A Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the ever-increasing requirements of ultra-high spectral efficiency, ultra-low latency, and massive connectivity, the forefront of wireless research calls for the design of advanced next generation multiple access schemes to facilitate provisioning of these stringent demands. This inspires the embrace of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in future wireless communication networks. Nevertheless, the support of massive access via NOMA leads to additional security threats, due to the open nature of the air interface, the broadcast characteristic of radio propagation as well as intertwined relationship among paired NOMA users. To address this specific challenge, the superimposed transmission of NOMA can be explored as new opportunities for security aware design, for example, multiuser interference inherent in NOMA can be constructively engineered to benefit communication secrecy and privacy. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art physical layer security techniques that guarantee wireless security and privacy for NOMA networks, along with the opportunities, technical challenges, and future research trends.</description>

Abstract: We devise achievable encoding schemes for distributed source compression for computing inner products, symmetric matrix products, and more generally, square matrix products, which are a class of nonlinear transformations. To that end, our approach relies on devising nonlinear mappings of distributed sources, which are then followed by the structured linear encoding scheme, introduced by K\"orner and Marton. For different computation scenarios, we contrast our findings on the achievable sum rate with the state of the art to demonstrate the possible savings in compression rate. When the sources have special correlation structures, it is possible to achieve unbounded gains, as demonstrated by the analysis and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Decoding Geometric Properties in Non-Random Data from First Information-Theoretic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the principles of information theory, measure theory, and theoretical computer science, we introduce a univariate signal deconvolution method with a wide range of applications to coding theory, particularly in zero-knowledge one-way communication channels, such as in deciphering messages from unknown generating sources about which no prior knowledge is available and to which no return message can be sent. Our multidimensional space reconstruction method from an arbitrary received signal is proven to be agnostic vis-a-vis the encoding-decoding scheme, computation model, programming language, formal theory, the computable (or semi-computable) method of approximation to algorithmic complexity, and any arbitrarily chosen (computable) probability measure of the events. The method derives from the principles of an approach to Artificial General Intelligence capable of building a general-purpose model of models independent of any arbitrarily assumed prior probability distribution. We argue that this optimal and universal method of decoding non-random data has applications to signal processing, causal deconvolution, topological and geometric properties encoding, cryptography, and bio- and technosignature detection.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Information Theory for Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) utilizes a compact antenna array to form a nearly continuous aperture, thereby enhancing higher capacity and more flexible configurations compared with conventional MIMO systems, making it attractive in current scientific research. Key questions naturally arise regarding the potential of HMIMO to surpass Shannon's theoretical limits and how far its capabilities can be extended. However, the traditional Shannon information theory falls short in addressing these inquiries because it only focuses on the information itself while neglecting the underlying carrier, electromagnetic (EM) waves, and environmental interactions. To fill up the gap between the theoretical analysis and the practical application for HMIMO systems, we introduce electromagnetic information theory (EIT) in this paper. This paper begins by laying the foundation for HMIMO-oriented EIT, encompassing EM wave equations and communication regions. In the context of HMIMO systems, the resultant physical limitations are presented, involving Chu's limit, Harrington's limit, Hannan's limit, and the evaluation of coupling effects. Field sampling and HMIMO-assisted oversampling are also discussed to guide the optimal HMIMO design within the EIT framework. To comprehensively depict the EM-compliant propagation process, we present the approximate and exact channel modeling approaches in near-/far-field zones. Furthermore, we discuss both traditional Shannon's information theory, employing the probabilistic method, and Kolmogorov information theory, utilizing the functional analysis, for HMIMO-oriented EIT systems.</description>

      <title>On the limitations of data-based price discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12723v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have enabled firms to use data to price discriminate. This paper studies third-degree price discrimination (3PD) based on a random sample of valuation and covariate data, where the covariate is continuous, and the distribution of the data is unknown to the seller. We first propose a $K$-markets empirical revenue maximization (ERM) strategy and study its rates of convergence in revenue. We then establish the fundamental information-theoretic limitation of any data-based pricing strategy and show that the $K$-markets ERM and the uniform (i.e., $1$-market) ERM strategies generate revenue converging to that of the true-distribution 3PD and uniform optima, respectively, at the optimal rate. A key takeaway from our information-theoretic limitation results is that, no sample-based 3PD strategy is able to escape from the curse of dimensionality and hence the $K$-markets ERM strategy is not an exception. This result prompts us to compare the revenues from the $K$-markets ERM and the uniform ERM in more specific cases. This comparison is ambiguous, in contrast to the classic pricing problem with a known distribution where third-degree price discrimination is at least as good as uniform pricing in generating revenue.</description>

      <title>On the sample complexity of parameter estimation in logistic regression with normal design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The logistic regression model is one of the most popular data generation model in noisy binary classification problems. In this work, we study the sample complexity of estimating the parameters of the logistic regression model up to a given $\ell_2$ error, in terms of the dimension and the inverse temperature, with standard normal covariates. The inverse temperature controls the signal-to-noise ratio of the data generation process. While both generalization bounds and asymptotic performance of the maximum-likelihood estimator for logistic regression are well-studied, the non-asymptotic sample complexity that shows the dependence on error and the inverse temperature for parameter estimation is absent from previous analyses. We show that the sample complexity curve has two change-points in terms of the inverse temperature, clearly separating the low, moderate, and high temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Near and Far Field Model Mismatch: Implications on 6G Communications, Localization, and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming 6G technology is expected to operate in near-field (NF) radiating conditions thanks to high-frequency and electrically large antenna arrays. Although several studies have already addressed this possibility, it is worth noting that NF models introduce higher complexity, the justification for which is not always evident in terms of performance improvements. This article investigates the implications of the mismatch between NF and far-field (FF) models concerning communication, localization, and sensing systems. Such disparity can lead to a degradation of performance metrics such as sensing and localization accuracy and communication efficiency. By exploring the effects of mismatches between NF and FF models, this study seeks to revolve around the challenges faced by system designers, offering insights about the balance between model accuracy and achievable performance. Finally, we conduct a numerical performance analysis to verify the impact of the mismatch between NF and FF models.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Diffusion via Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models enable conditional generation and density modeling of complex relationships like images and text. However, the nature of the learned relationships is opaque making it difficult to understand precisely what relationships between words and parts of an image are captured, or to predict the effect of an intervention. We illuminate the fine-grained relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship between diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the denoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific images and captions. Decomposing information even further to understand which variables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing problem. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify informative relationships between words and pixels in an image. We exploit these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion models, to do unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure effects when selectively editing images through prompt interventions.</description>

      <title>Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set of vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ of them include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists a positive constant $\delta = \delta (p)$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k^{1/(p-1)}$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k^{1/(p-1)}/ \log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. In particular, for the binary field we obtain a set of $d^{\Omega( k /\log k)}$ vectors, and this is tight up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. For comparison, the best known lower bound over the reals is $d^{\Omega( \log k / \log \log k)}$ (Alon and Szegedy, Graphs and Combin., 1999). The proof combines probabilistic and spectral arguments.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Fair Binary Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate binary classification under the constraints of both differential privacy and fairness. We first propose an algorithm based on the decoupling technique for learning a classifier with only fairness guarantee. This algorithm takes in classifiers trained on different demographic groups and generates a single classifier satisfying statistical parity. We then refine this algorithm to incorporate differential privacy. The performance of the final algorithm is rigorously examined in terms of privacy, fairness, and utility guarantees. Empirical evaluations conducted on the Adult and Credit Card datasets illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of fairness guarantees, while maintaining the same level of privacy and utility.</description>
