      <title>Including frameworks of public health ethics in computational modelling of infectious disease interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decisions on public health interventions to control infectious disease are often informed by computational models. Interpreting the predicted outcomes of a public health decision requires not only high-quality modelling, but also an ethical framework for assessing the benefits and harms associated with different options. The design and specification of ethical frameworks matured independently of computational modelling, so many values recognised as important for ethical decision-making are missing from computational models. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept approach to incorporate multiple public health values into the evaluation of a simple computational model for vaccination against a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2. By examining a bounded space of alternative prioritisations of values (outcome equity and aggregate benefit) we identify value trade-offs, where the outcomes of optimal strategies differ depending on the ethical framework. This work demonstrates an approach to incorporating diverse values into decision criteria used to evaluate outcomes of models of infectious disease interventions.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Multi-Dimensional Opinions with Topic-Weighted Discordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People's opinions on a wide range of topics often evolve over time through their interactions with others. Models of opinion dynamics primarily focus on one-dimensional opinions which represent opinions on one topic. However, opinions on various topics are rarely isolated; instead, they can be interdependent and exhibit correlations. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, agents influence each other's opinions only if their opinions are sufficiently similar. We extend classical agent-based BCMs -- namely, the Hegeselmann--Krause BCM, which has synchronous interactions, and the Deffuant--Weisbuch BCM, which has asynchronous interactions -- to a multidimensional setting, in which the opinions are multidimensional vectors representing opinions of different topics and opinions on different topics are interdependent. To measure opinion differences between agents, we introduce topic-weighted discordance functions that account for opinion differences in all topics. We use the regions of receptiveness to characterize the steady-state opinion clusters and provide an analytical approach to compute these regions. In addition, we numerically simulate our models on various networks with initial opinions drawn from a variety of distributions. When initial opinions are correlated across different topics, our topic-weighted BCMs yield significantly different results in both transient and steady states compared to baseline models, where the dynamics of each opinion topic are independent.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Society Caused by Collective and Individual Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the assumptions of the ViSE model, we investigate the welfare and performance of a society consisting of one group (a ``party'') and individualists. In the case of Gaussian proposal generators, the expected capital gains can be expressed in standard functions. The relative effectiveness of individualistic and group strategies of agents, as well as the benefits of the entire society, depend on the level of cooperation, the voting threshold, and the favorability of the environment. We focus on the evolution of society in neutral environments caused by changing its structure and the voting rule in the interests of agents.</description>

      <title>Navigating pollution: A multimodal approach to traffic and exposure management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few studies quantify how traffic management dynamically reshapes modal split and emission-exposure outcomes over pollution severities. This paper proposes a novel day-to-day assignment model integrating exposure cost, which includes exposure perception and emissions-dispersion-exposure algorithm. Numerical experiments reveal that and various levels of traffic-related measures have an air pollution scenario-dependent effect on the MT system. In light pollution scenarios, vehicle restrictions and reduced fares for buses or ridesharing help lower car usage and reduce emissions and exposure. However, under heavy pollution, higher-level restrictions and ridesharing fares paradoxically increase travelers' exposure by 18% and 6.3%, respectively, due to modal shift. Furthermore, timely pollution information updates could plausibly encourage healthier travel. This paper also proposes practical strategies for both routine and emergency traffic management, considering the trade-offs among travel cost, emission, and exposure, and emphasizes the need for measures tailored to different air pollution contexts to offer deeper insights for urban traffic policies.</description>

      <title>Modeling Technological Deployment and Renewal: Monotonic vs. Oscillating Industrial Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new model based on a classic S-curve that describes deployment and stabilization at maximum capacity. In addition, the model extends to the post-growth plateau, where technological capacity is renewed according to the distribution of equipment lifespans. We obtain two qualitatively different results. In the case of "fast" deployment, characterized by a short deployment time in relation to the average equipment lifetime, production is subject to significant oscillations. In the case of "slow" deployment, production increases monotonically until it reaches a renewal plateau. These results are counterintuitively validated by two case studies: nuclear power plants as a fast deployment and smartphones as a slow deployment. These results are important for long-term industrial planning, as they enable us to anticipate future business cycles. Our study demonstrates that business cycles can originate endogenously from industrial dynamics of installation and renewal, contrasting with traditional views attributing fluctuations to exogenous macroeconomic factors. These endogenous cycles interact with broader trends, potentially being modulated, amplified, or attenuated by macroeconomic conditions. This dynamic of deployment and renewal is relevant for long-life infrastructure technologies, such as those supporting the renewable energy sector and has major policy implications for industry players.</description>

      <title>Human-Agent Interaction in Synthetic Social Networks: A Framework for Studying Online Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social networks have dramatically altered the landscape of public discourse, creating both opportunities for enhanced civic participation and risks of deepening social divisions. Prevalent approaches to studying online polarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical models excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language model-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice analytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational framework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion dynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous mathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our framework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation with 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network environment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate polarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings reveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior: participants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased sensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving reduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical precision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues for investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation. This methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented opportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Network-Driven Vaccination Strategies for Preventing Rebound Dynamics in Metapopulation Epidemic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical question in epidemic control concerns the minimal requirements for a vaccination campaign to effectively halt a contagion process. However, control measures can inadvertently trigger resurgence dynamics, driven by a reservoir of susceptible individuals left unexposed in the controlled wave. This phenomenon, known as the "rebound effect", is often preceded by a temporary drop in cases, termed usually as the "honeymoon period". In this study, we examine the fundamental conditions for rebound dynamics within a metapopulation network framework. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying rebound events, we derive a rigorous mathematical criterion that identifies, based solely on the metapopulation network structure, the specific vaccination strategies likely to precipitate a rebound. Additionally, we propose an alternative vaccination protocol designed to eliminate rebound dynamics entirely. This approach is analytically validated and offers a robust pathway toward sustainable epidemic control.</description>

      <title>Identification and Optimization of High-Performance Passing Networks in Football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between the performance of a football team and the topological parameters of temporal passing networks. To achieve this, we propose a method to identify moments of high and low team performance based on the analysis of match events. This approach enables the construction of sets of temporal passing networks associated with each performance context. By analyzing topological metrics such as clustering, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness across both sets, significant structural differences were identified between moments of high and low performance. These differences reflect changes in the interaction dynamics among players and, consequently, in the team's playing system. Subsequently, a logistic regression model was employed to classify high- and low-performance networks. The analysis of the model coefficients identified which metrics need to be adjusted to promote the emergence of structures associated with better performance. This framework provides quantitative tools to guide tactical decisions and optimize playing dynamics. Finally, the proposed method was applied to address the ``blocked player" problem, optimizing passing relationships to minimize the emergence of structures associated with low performance, thereby ensuring more robust dynamics against contextual changes.</description>

      <title>Competition and survival in modern academia: A bibliometric case study of theoretical high-energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the career lengths of researchers in theoretical high-energy physics from 1950 to 2020. Using a cohort-based analysis and bibliometric data from 30,149 authors in three physics disciplines we observe a dramatic increase in the ratio of academic dropouts over time. Where nearly all authors prior to the 1980s remained active more than a decade after their initial publication, this was the case for 50% or less by the 2010s. Consequently, the fraction of theoretical physicists who achieve full academic careers have diminished significantly in the last four decades. Additionally, we study correlations between author survivability and potential success factors, inferring that early author productivity and collaborative efforts have become increasingly strong determinants over time. A logistic regression is utilized to interpret the empirical findings through a survival model. Performance measures further indicate that early career collaboration and productivity rates have emerged as reliable predictors of author survivability during the period in which competition has intensified. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts that these developments may have on science itself.</description>

      <title>Accurately Estimating Unreported Infections using Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant challenges in combating against the spread of infectious diseases was the difficulty in estimating the true magnitude of infections. Unreported infections could drive up disease spread, making it very hard to accurately estimate the infectivity of the pathogen, therewith hampering our ability to react effectively. Despite the use of surveillance-based methods such as serological studies, identifying the true magnitude is still challenging. This paper proposes an information theoretic approach for accurately estimating the number of total infections. Our approach is built on top of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) based models, which are commonly used in epidemiology and for estimating such infections. We show how we can help such models to better compute the number of total infections and identify the parametrization by which we need the fewest bits to describe the observed dynamics of reported infections. Our experiments on COVID-19 spread show that our approach leads to not only substantially better estimates of the number of total infections but also better forecasts of infections than standard model calibration based methods. We additionally show how our learned parametrization helps in modeling more accurate what-if scenarios with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our approach provides a general method for improving epidemic modeling which is applicable broadly.</description>

      <title>Trade Dynamics of the Global Dry Bulk Shipping Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the inherently random structures of dry bulk shipping networks, often likened to a taxi service, and identifies the underlying trade dynamics that contribute to this randomness within individual cargo sub-networks. By analysing micro-level trade flow data from 2015 to 2023, we explore the evolution of dry commodity networks, including grain, coal, and iron ore, and suggest that the Giant Strongly Connected Components exhibit small-world phenomena, indicative of efficient bilateral trade. The significant heterogeneity of in-degree and out-degree within these sub-networks, primarily driven by importing ports, underscores the complexity of their dynamics. Our temporal analysis shows that while the Covid-19 pandemic profoundly impacted the coal network, the Ukraine conflict significantly altered the grain network, resulting in changes in community structures. Notably, grain sub-networks display periodic changes, suggesting distinct life cycles absent in coal and iron ore networks. These findings illustrate that the randomness in dry bulk shipping networks is a reflection of real-world trade dynamics, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in navigating and predicting network behaviours.</description>

      <title>Polyadic Opinion Formation: The Adaptive Voter Model on a Hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adaptive voter model is widely used to model opinion dynamics in social complex networks. However, existing adaptive voter models are limited to only pairwise interactions and fail to capture the intricate social dynamics that arises in groups. This paper extends the adaptive voter model to hypergraphs to explore how forces of peer pressure influence collective decision-making. The model consists of two processes: individuals can either consult the group and change their opinion or leave the group and join a different one. The interplay between those two processes gives rise to a two-phase dynamics. In the initial phase, the topology of the hypergraph quickly reaches a new stable state. In the subsequent phase, opinion dynamics plays out on the new topology depending on the mechanism by which opinions spread. If the group always follows the majority, the network rapidly converges to fragmented communities. In contrast, if individuals choose an opinion proportionally to its representation in the group, the system remains in a metastable state for an extended period of time. The results are supported both by stochastic simulations and an analytical mean-field description in terms of hypergraph moments with a moment closure at the pair level.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the Reddit collective action leading to the GameStop short squeeze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In early 2021, the stock prices of GameStop, AMC, Nokia and BlackBerry experienced dramatic increases, triggered by short-squeeze operations that have been largely attributed to Reddit's retail investors. Here, we shed light on the extent and timing of Reddit users' influence on the GameStop short squeeze. Using statistical analysis tools with high temporal resolution, we find that increasing Reddit discussions anticipated high trading volumes. This effect emerged abruptly a few weeks before the event but waned once the community gained widespread visibility through Twitter. Meanwhile, the collective investment of the community quantified through posts of individual positions, closely mirrored the market capitalization of the stock. This evidence suggests a coordinated action of users in developing a shared financial strategy through social media--targeting GameStop first and other stocks afterward. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the role of Reddit users in the dynamics of the GameStop short squeeze.</description>

      <title>Competing Social Contagions with Opinion Dependent Infectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation (maliciously spread false information) in online social networks has become an important problem in today's society. Disinformation's spread is facilitated by the fact that individuals often accept false information based on cognitive biases which predispose them to believe information that they have heard repeatedly or that aligns with their beliefs. Moreover, disinformation often spreads in direct competition with a corresponding true information. To model these phenomena, we develop a model for two competing beliefs spreading on a social network, where individuals have an internal opinion that models their cognitive biases and modulates their likelihood of adopting one of the competing beliefs. By numerical simulations of an agent-based model and a mean-field description of the dynamics, we study how the long-term dynamics of the spreading process depends on the initial conditions for the number of spreaders and the initial opinion of the population. We find that the addition of cognitive biases enriches the transient dynamics of the spreading process, facilitating behavior such as the revival of a dying belief and the overturning of an initially widespread opinion. Finally, we study how external recruitment of spreaders can lead to the eventual dominance of one of the two beliefs.</description>

      <title>Geospatial analysis of toponyms in geotagged social media posts</title>

Abstract: Place names, or toponyms, play an integral role in human representation and communication of geographic space. In particular, how people relate each toponym with particular locations in geographic space should be indicative of their spatial perception. Here, we make use of an extensive dataset of georeferenced social media posts, retrieved from Twitter, to perform a statistical analysis of the geographic distribution of toponyms and uncover the relationship between toponyms and geographic space. We show that the occurrence of toponyms is characterized by spatial inhomogeneity, giving rise to patterns that are distinct from the distribution of common nouns. Using simple models, we quantify the spatial specificity of toponym distributions and identify their core-periphery structures. In particular, we find that toponyms are used with a probability that decays as a power law with distance from the geographic center of their occurrence. Our findings highlight the potential of social media data to explore linguistic patterns in geographic space, paving the way for comprehensive analyses of human spatial representations.</description>

      <title>Regional profile of questionable publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Countries and authors in the academic periphery occasionally have been criticized for contributing to the expansion of questionable publishing because they share a major fraction of papers in questionable journals. On the other side, topics preferred by mainstream journals sometimes necessitate large-scale investigation, which is impossible for developing countries. Thus, local journals, commonly low-impacted, are essential to sustain the regional academia for such countries. In this study, we perform an in-depth analysis of the distribution of questionable publications and journals with their interplay with countries quantifying the influence of questionable publications regarding academia's inequality. We find that low-impact journals play a vital role in the regional academic environment, whereas questionable journals with equivalent impact publish papers from all over the world, both geographically and academically. The business model of questionable journals differs from that of regional journals, and may thus be detrimental to the broader academic community.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Connectivity Caused by Local Communities in Spatial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local communities are widely observed in spatial networks. However, how such structure affects the vulnerability against malicious attacks remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of local communities on the robustness of connectivity by modeling planar infrastructure networks based on statistical population data. Our research reveals that the emergence of local communities is caused by spatial concentrations of nodes connected by short links, which significantly reduce the robustness. These results suggest that strategically establishing long distance links provides a feasible solution to balance reliability and construction costs in infrastructure network design.</description>
