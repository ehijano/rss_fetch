      <title>Hybrid LLM and Higher-Order Quantum Approximate Optimization for CSA Collateral Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address finance-native collateral optimization under ISDA Credit Support Annexes (CSAs), where integer lots, Schedule A haircuts, RA/MTA gating, and issuer/currency/class caps create rugged, legally bounded search spaces. We introduce a certifiable hybrid pipeline purpose-built for this domain: (i) an evidence-gated LLM that extracts CSA terms to a normalized JSON (abstain-by-default, span-cited); (ii) a quantum-inspired explorer that interleaves simulated annealing with micro higher order QAOA (HO-QAOA) on binding sub-QUBOs (subset size n &lt;= 16, order k &lt;= 4) to coordinate multi-asset moves across caps and RA-induced discreteness; (iii) a weighted risk-aware objective (Movement, CVaR, funding-priced overshoot) with an explicit coverage window U &lt;= Reff+B; and (iv) CP-SAT as single arbiter to certify feasibility and gaps, including a U-cap pre-check that reports the minimal feasible buffer B*. Encoding caps/rounding as higher-order terms lets HO-QAOA target the domain couplings that defeat local swaps. On government bond datasets and multi-CSA inputs, the hybrid improves a strong classical baseline (BL-3) by 9.1%, 9.6%, and 10.7% across representative harnesses, delivering better cost-movement-tail frontiers under governance settings. We release governance grade artifacts-span citations, valuation matrix audit, weight provenance, QUBO manifests, and CP-SAT traces-to make results auditable and reproducible.</description>

      <title>An Impulse Control Approach to Market Making in a Hawkes LOB Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal Market Making problem in a Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulated using a high-fidelity, mutually exciting Hawkes process. Departing from traditional Brownian-driven mid-price models, our setup captures key microstructural properties such as queue dynamics, inter-arrival clustering, and endogenous price impact. Recognizing the realistic constraint that market makers cannot update strategies at every LOB event, we formulate the control problem within an impulse control framework, where interventions occur discretely via limit, cancel, or market orders. This leads to a high-dimensional, non-local Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Quasi-Variational Inequality (HJB-QVI), whose solution is analytically intractable and computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approximation inspired by auxiliary control formulations. Using a two-network PPO-based architecture with self-imitation learning, we demonstrate strong empirical performance with limited training, achieving Sharpe ratios above 30 in a realistic simulated LOB. In addition to that, we solve the HJB-QVI using a deep learning method inspired by Sirignano and Spiliopoulos 2018 and compare the performance with the RL agent. Our findings highlight the promise of combining impulse control theory with modern deep RL to tackle optimal execution problems in jump-driven microstructural markets.</description>
