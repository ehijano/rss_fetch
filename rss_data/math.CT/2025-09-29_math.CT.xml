      <title>A functorial approach to $0$-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use functorial methods to define and study $0$-abelian categories, which we propose to be the case $n = 0$ of Jasso's $n$-abelian categories. In particular, we define a bifunctor for $0$-abelian categories with enough injectives or projectives, which is analogous to the extension bifunctor for an abelian category. We prove a few results concerning this bifunctor, including $0$-abelian versions of the long exact sequence involving the extension bifunctors, of a conjecture due to Auslander on the direct summands of the extension functors, and of the Hilton-Rees theorem. These results are then applied to the study of the stable categories of a $0$-abelian category, and a similar discussion is carried out for the stable categories of an abelian category. Moreover, by specializing our results to modules over rings, we show that $0$-abelian categories with additive generators are in correspondence with semi-hereditary rings. We present applications to these rings.</description>

      <title>Double categorical equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and user-friendly method for constructing any cofibrantly generated model structure on the category of double categories whose trivial fibrations are the "canonical" ones: the double functors which are surjective on objects, full on both horizontal and vertical morphisms, and fully faithful on squares. We show that all of these model structures are left proper and that they are localizations of the gregarious model structure introduced by Campbell. As a notable consequence, this identifies the gregarious weak equivalences as the "canonical" equivalences of double categories, an elusive notion thus far. Moreover, the nature of our method gives an explicit description of the fibrant objects in terms of lifting conditions. We use this to recover several known model structures, as well as construct several new examples whose homotopy theories encode a range of $2$-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Higher condensation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. We also establish the connections among various notions of "gauging" symmetries. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck groups of repetitive cluster categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to study cluster-tilted algebras and their intermediate coverings, Zhu introduced the notion of repetitive cluster categories, defined as the orbit categories $\mathcal D^b(\mathcal H)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$ for $1\leq p\in\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathcal H$ is a hereditary abelian category with tilting objects. In this paper, we compute partial but essential results on the Grothendieck groups of the repetitive cluster categories $\mathcal D^b({\rm mod}KA_n)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$ and $\mathcal D^b({\rm mod} KD_n)/\langle(\tau^{-1}\Sigma)^p\rangle$. Our results extend the known computations for classical cluster categories, reveal new structural patterns arising from the repetitive parameter $p$, and provide further evidence of the close interplay between Grothendieck groups, Auslander-Reiten theory, and Coxeter transformations.</description>
