      <title>A Hybrid Algorithm for Drift-Kinetic Particle Dynamics within General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations of Black Holes Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical plasmas in relativistic spacetimes, such as black hole accretion flows, are often weakly collisional and require kinetic modeling to capture non-local transport and particle acceleration. However, the extreme scale separation between microscopic and macroscopic processes limits the feasibility of fully kinetic simulations. A covariant guiding center formalism has recently been derived to address this challenge in curved spacetimes. We present a new hybrid numerical algorithm based on this formalism, which evolves the trajectories of charged particles over macroscopic timescales in GRMHD backgrounds. To address numerical instabilities in the equations of motion, we develop a semi-implicit integrator that ensures stable evolution in strong-field environments. We apply our method to GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency across a range of physical conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of Galaxy Catalogues for following up gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GW) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network has opened up a new era in astrophysics. The identification of the electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources is crucial for multi-messenger astronomy, one way of which is to use galaxy catalogues to guide optical follow-up observations. In this paper, we test the utility of galaxy-targeted approach with mass prioritised galaxy ranking for the ongoing LIGO O4 run. We have used the simulated results for the expected LIGO O4 events and the NED-LVS galaxy catalogue and based our study for small field of view telescopes, specifically the GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). With the increase in sensitivity of LIGO/Virgo in the ongoing observing run O4, the expected number of total detections have gone up but most of these are also now poorly localised. We show that a larger volume covered in the same field-of-view (FoV) on the sky results in a large increase in the total number of galaxies in each FoV. A significant top-heaviness is observed in the mass-ranked list of galaxies, which still number to a few thousand in most cases. At larger distances, such high numbers of deep follow-up observations are infeasible in most cases rendering galaxy catalogues useful in limited cases, but these are still useful at lower distances where LVK detectors are currently sensitive and where galaxy completeness is higher. We also explore the effect of mass-filling to account for galaxy catalogue incompleteness at large distances. If mass-filled probabilities are considered as the metric for ranking and coverage, we find that the conventional 2D probability search performs better than a 3D galaxy catalogue (without mass-filling) based search at distances larger than 300 Mpc (upto which NED-LVS is ~70% complete), and using 3D mass times probability in each tile performs better for nearby events.</description>

      <title>X-ray Measurements of $^{44}$Ti in Four Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for scandium K$_\alpha$ X-ray fluorescence resulting from $^{44}$Ti electron capture decay in four young supernova remnants. We analyzed archival XMM-Newton data from Tycho's SNR, Kepler's SNR, Cassiopeia A, and SN 1987A. We fit the X-ray spectra in regions of interest with up to four components, thermal and power-law, as needed to fit the spectrum, and add a gaussian to test for extra Sc emission. While all require the line with modest confidence, none represent definitive detections on their own, and all are consistent with previous gamma-ray detections or limits on the $^{44}$Ti mass.</description>

      <title>SEDONA-GesaRaT: an AI-Accelerated Radiative Transfer Program for 3-D Supernova Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SEDONA-GesaRaT, a rapid code for supernova radiative transfer simulation developed based on the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code SEDONA. We use a set of atomic physics neural networks (APNN), an artificial intelligence (AI) solver for the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) atomic physics level population calculation, which is trained and validated on 119 1-D type Ia supernova (SN Ia) radiative transfer simulation results showing great computation speed and accuracy. SEDONA-GesaRaT has been applied to the 3-D SN Ia explosion model N100 to perform a 3-D NLTE radiative transfer calculation. The spatially resolved linear polarization data cubes of the N100 model are successfully retrieved with a high signal-to-noise ratio using the integral-based technique (IBT). The overall computation cost of a 3-D NLTE spectropolarimetry simulation using SEDONA-GesaRaT is only $\sim$3000 core-hours, while the previous codes could only finish 1-D NLTE simulation, or 3-D local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) simulation, with similar computation resources. The excellent computing efficiency allows SEDONA-GesaRaT for future large-scale simulations that systematically study the internal structures of supernovae.</description>

      <title>Enhancements to the IceCube Extremely High Energy Neutrino Selection using Graph &amp; Transformer Based Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KM3NeT has recently reported the detection of a very high-energy neutrino event, while IceCube has previously set upper limits on the differential neutrino flux above 100 PeV but has yet to observe a neutrino event with an energy comparable to that of the KM3NeT detection. To improve diffuse measurements above 10 PeV, we apply machine learning techniques to enhance atmospheric muon background rejection and directional reconstruction. We utilize a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform a classification task that distinguishes neutrinos from high-energy atmospheric muons. The method allows for the rejection of early hits from laterally spread, lower-energy muons in cosmic ray showers without relying on directional reconstruction as a prior. Additionally, a Transformer-based Neural Network is implemented for directional reconstruction. Unlike previous likelihood-based rapid reconstruction algorithms that assume a single muon track, this method makes no prior assumptions about event topology of the particle inside the detector. We demonstrate improved background rejection and reconstruction performance using machine learning techniques. Applications to the development of future Extremely High Energy (EHE) selections are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Low-latency Forecasts of Kilonova Light Curves for Rubin and ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Follow-up of gravitational-wave events by wide-field surveys is a crucial tool for the discovery of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources, such as kilonovae. Machine learning tools can play an important role in aiding search efforts. We have developed a public tool to predict kilonova light curves using simulated low-latency alert data from the International Gravitational Wave Network during observing runs 4 (O4) and 5 (O5). It uses a bidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to forecast kilonova light curves from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time filters. The model achieves a test mean squared error (MSE) of 0.19 for ZTF filters and 0.22 for Rubin filters, calculated by averaging the squared error over all time steps, filters, and light curves in the test set. We verify the performance of the model against merger events followed-up by the ZTF partnership during O4a and O4b. We also analyze the effect of incorporating skymaps and constraints on physical features such as ejecta mass through a hybrid convolutional neural network and LSTM model. Using ejecta mass, the performance of the model improves to an MSE of 0.1. However, using full skymap information results in slightly lower model performance. Our models are publicly available and can help to add important information to help plan follow-up of candidate events discovered by current and next-generation public surveys.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Detection of Carbon Monoxide in the Type II Supernova SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) may contribute a significant amount of dust in the early universe. Freshly formed coolant molecules (e.g., CO) and warm dust can be found in CCSNe as early as ~100 d after the explosion, allowing the study of their evolution with time series observations. In the Type II SN 2023ixf, we aim to investigate the temporal evolution of the temperature, velocity, and mass of CO and compare them with other CCSNe, exploring their implications for the dust formation in CCSNe. From observations of velocity profiles of lines of other species (e.g., H and He), we also aim to characterize and understand the interaction of the SN ejecta with pre-existing circumstellar material (CSM). We present a time series of 16 near-infrared spectra of SN 2023ixf from 9 to 307 d, taken with multiple instruments: Gemini/GNIRS, Keck/NIRES, IRTF/SpeX, and MMT/MMIRS. The early (t&lt;70 d) spectra indicate interaction between the expanding ejecta and nearby CSM. At t&lt;20 d, intermediate-width line profiles corresponding to the ejecta-wind interaction are superposed on evolving broad P Cygni profiles. We find intermediate-width and narrow lines in the spectra until t&lt;70 d, which suggest continued CSM interaction. We also observe and discuss high-velocity absorption features in H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles formed by CSM interaction. The spectra contain CO first overtone emission between 199 and 307~d after the explosion. We model the CO emission and find the CO to have a higher velocity (3000-3500 km/s) than that in Type II-pec SN 1987A (1800 - 2000 km/s) during similar phases (t=199-307 d) and a comparable CO temperature to SN 1987A. A flattened continuum at wavelengths greater than 1.5 $\mu$m accompanies the CO emission, indicating the presence of warm dust forming in the ejecta. The warm dust masses are estimated to be in the range of 1.0-2.3$\times$10$^{-5} M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Investigating Universal Relations in Compact Stars featuring $\Delta-$Admixed Exotic Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dense material in a compact star from a supernova remnant is beyond terrestrial experimentation, so phenomenological modeling is used to match astrophysical observations. This is crucial due to the complex sensitivity of compact star features to dense matter properties. Despite modeling flexibility, certain universal relationships among compact star features hold true, regardless of the matter model. Our study examines these universal relationships, focusing on the moment of inertia, tidal Love number, and quadrupole moment, as well as correlations between non-radial oscillation frequencies and star compactness. We consider baryonic stars with cores of heavier baryons. Our findings show that baryonic stars with cores of heavier baryons follow the universal relations, and the f-mode oscillation frequency's universality relative to tidal deformability is notable, with an error margin under 1$\%$.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the cosmogenic origin of the KM3-230213A event: A Multimessenger Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of the neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$~220 PeV) by the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope, the most energetic ever observed, could represent the long-awaited evidence for a cosmogenic origin, arising from the interaction of an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray with background photons. Its secure confirmation would mark a major advance in high-energy astrophysics. We perform a self-consistent multimessenger transport calculation of protons and their secondary $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos from cosmologically evolving sources, confronting predictions with data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, KM3NeT, and the Fermi-LAT isotropic $\gamma$-ray background. A steep sub-ankle proton component saturates the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background and is disfavoured, whereas a hard proton spectrum extending beyond $10^{20}$~eV with evolution $\propto (1+z)^3$ reproduces KM3-230213A without violating any limits. This scenario requires a proton fraction $\lesssim 10$\% at $3\times 10^{19}$~eV and excludes faster-evolving sources. Joint UHE-neutrino and $\gamma$-ray observations thus sharpen constraints on extragalactic cosmic-ray sources and set targets for AugerPrime and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Testing the influence of anisotropic CR transport and the Galactic magnetic field structure on the all-sky gamma-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial diffusion of energetic particles in a magnetic field composed of a large-scale background and a small-scale turbulent component should be expected to be anisotropic. While such anisotropic diffusion has been known for quite a while in first-principle plasma physics and while it is required for an understanding of the transport of cosmic rays in the heliosphere or close to supernova remnants, only in recent years it has also become of particular interest for the modeling of Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) transport in the Milky Way in the context of their residence time and their (local) energy spectra. Also, the large-scale spatial distribution of GCRs is shaped by an anisotropic diffusion in the Galactic magnetic field, which should directly affect both the diffuse gamma-ray and the neutrino emission.
  We solve the anisotropic diffusive transport of GCRs in the Milky Way using the publicly available transport code CRPropa. The anisotropy of the diffusion is characterized by the ratio between the diffusion coefficient perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic field $\epsilon = D_\perp / D_\parallel$, where we test different values reaching from nearly parallel transport ($\epsilon = 10^{-3}$) to more isotropic diffusion ($\epsilon = 10^{-1}$).
  From the three dimensional distribution of GCRs in the Milky Way we calculate the all-sky gamma-ray emission, using the line-of-sight integration framework HERMES. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of the anisotropy in the diffusion on the spatial distribution of the gamma-ray flux and its spectral energy distribution. It shows strong influences by the anisotropy of the diffusion and the magnetic field geometry.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Oscillations due to radiative feedback mechanism between the disc and corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact object systems exhibit Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) as revealed by peaked features in their power density spectra. It has been known that stochastic variations in the accretion disc will propagate to the corona after a time delay and that the hard X-rays from the corona impinge back on the disc, giving reflection spectral features. Here, we show that the combination of these two effects makes a simple radiative feedback system between the corona and the disc, which naturally produces the observed QPOs whose primary frequency corresponds to the inverse of the time delay. The analytical form of the expected power spectra can be statistically compared with the observed ones. Hence, for the first time, a physical model is used to describe and fit the AstroSat observed power spectra of the black hole systems MAXI J1535-571 and GRS 1915+105, including the QPO, its harmonics, as well as the broadband components.</description>

      <title>Constraining shear modulus of polycrystalline neutron star crust: Hashin-Shtrikman variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic properties of the neutron star crust are thought to play a crucial role in various phenomena of neutron stars (glitches, oscillations, gravitational wave emission) and should be described quantitatively to model these phenomena. The fundamental problem of this description is associated with the polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the elastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of crystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some assumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or constrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed assumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe elastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The bulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the shear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars, the variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption that there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the electron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static crystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the effective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically applied in the astrophysical literature.</description>

      <title>Search for Quantum Decoherence with 10.7 years of atmospheric $\nu_\mu$ events in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to develop a consistent quantum theory of gravity, we must understand the nature of spacetime at the Planck scale. In particular if it exhibits quantum fluctuations, they may cause propagating particles to evolve in an apparently non-unitary manner. Neutrinos, which interact only via the weak force and gravity, maintain quantum coherence while propagating over large distances. Thus, neutrino oscillations serve as a precise interferometer to search for Planck-scale fluctuations of spacetime. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the world's largest neutrino telescope, located in the Antarctic icecap. We search the data on atmospheric neutrinos detected by IceCube in the energy range 0.5-100 TeV to test for neutrino decoherence. In this contribution, we present the sensitivity of the analysis, which shows significant improvement compared to previous IceCube results as a result of improved reconstruction and a larger sample of events.</description>

      <title>All-sky search for short gravitational-wave bursts in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.</description>

      <title>On the Fast-radio-burst-associated X-ray Bursts: Inverse Compton Scattering of Radio Photons by an Extreme Pair Flow During Magnetosphere Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 200428 was associated with a short X-ray burst (XRB) from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one of its active phases. This FRB-associated XRB exhibits distinct properties compared to other typical XRBs, including a significantly higher cutoff energy and a steeper power-law index. Its recovered X-ray light curve shows a multiple-peak structure, with the time of arrival offset from that of the FRB. These unique features imply a special physical link between the FRB and X-ray emissions. In 2022 October, a similar FRB-XRB association was detected from the same source. In this paper, we propose a model in which the observed spectral and temporal features of the associated XRBs can be attributed to the inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of FRB photons by an extreme pair flow around the light cylinder, with a bulk Lorentz factor of $\Gamma\sim10$ and a power-law distribution in the comoving frame, characterized by a typical Lorentz factor $\gamma^\prime_\mathrm{m}\sim5\times 10^4$. This extreme pair flow could originate from the compression of a transient pulse of $\sim10^{40}-10^{41}\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and the acceleration through magnetic reconnection in the current sheet during magnetar activity. The Doppler-boosted ICS spectra and the arrival time shifts in such a scenario can well explain the observed features of the FRB 200428-associated XRB and can also account for another associated event in 2022.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations of Event Time Series with Sparse Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection, Similarity Search, and Unsupervised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.</description>

Abstract: We present the public release of the low-frequency atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering signals with frequencies from 20 Hz to 200 Hz and frequency derivatives from -5e-11 to 5e-11 Hz/s. Compared to the previous atlas releases, this version demonstrates significant improvements in sensitivity and sky resolution. In the most sensitive region even the worst-case upper limits on gravitational wave strain are below 1e-25. The atlas data is being released ahead of the completion of the full follow-up analysis.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Clumps as Sources of Gravitational-Wave Glitches in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the hypothetical possibility that non-stationary glitch features in the noise of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors could be produced by small dark matter clumps that pass through the earth in the vicinity of gravitational-wave detectors. We first derive the gravitational-wave strain that would be generated by the passage of such a dark matter clump. We find that the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational acceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of the photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential created by the dark matter clump. We also find that the Newtonian acceleration effect dominates the gravitational-wave strain for both ground and space-based interferometers. We then compare our dark matter clump, gravitational-wave strain model to 84 Koi-Fish glitches detected during the second observing run of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian analysis. We find that all glitches but 9 can be confidently rejected as having originated from dark matter clumps. For the remaining glitches, the dark matter hypothesis cannot be excluded, and the maximum \textit{a posteriori} parameters yield minimum densities of about $10^{-7} {\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^3$, within the model. These results allow us to place the first direct upper limits with gravitational-wave detectors on the local over-density of dark matter in the form of clumps in the local neighborhood of Earth, namely $\rho_{{\rm DM} \, {\rm clumps}} \lesssim 10^{-15} {\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>SLAMS-Propelled Electron Acceleration at High-Mach Number Astrophysical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short Large Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) are frequently detected during spacecraft crossings over the Earth bow shock. We investigate the existence of such structures at astrophysical shocks, where they could result from the steepening of cosmic-ray (CR) driven waves. Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we study the growth of SLAMS and the appearance of associated transient shocks in the upstream region of quasi-parallel, non-relativistic, high-Mach number collisionless shocks. We find that high-energy CRs significantly enhance the transverse magnetic field within SLAMS, producing highly inclined field lines. As SLAMS are advected towards the shock, these fields lines form an intermittent superluminal configuration which traps magnetized electrons at fast shocks. Due to their oscillatory nature, SLAMS are periodically separated by subluminal gaps with lower transverse magnetic field strength. In these regions, electrons diffuse and accelerate by bouncing between the shock and the approaching SLAMS region through a mechanism that we call quasi-periodic shock acceleration (QSA). We analytically derive the distribution of electrons accelerated via QSA, $f(p)\sim p^{[-4.7,-5.7]}$, which agrees well with the simulation spectra. We find that the electron power law remains steep until the end of our longest runs, providing a possible explanation for the steep electron spectra observed at least up to GeV energies in young and fast supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Very-high-energy gamma rays from cosmic rays escaping from Galactic black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the cosmic-ray diffusion around a Galactic black hole binary (microquasars) by considering the finite size of the escape region and the continuous cosmic-ray injection. We find that the energy spectrum of escaping cosmic rays in the gamma-ray emission region is described by a broken power law spectrum with one or two spectral breaks even though the total spectrum of escaping cosmic rays is a single power law spectrum. Using the solution for the diffusion equation, we construct a unified picture that explains spatially extended very-high-energy gamma rays from five microquasars observed by HAWC and LHAASO. The comparison of our unified model and observed data suggest that all five microquasars have the same energy spectrum of the escaping CRs, $dN/dE \propto E^{-2}$, the same diffusion coefficient, and the same emission region. The hard energy spectrum without the high-energy cutoff supports the idea that the origin of Galactic CRs beyond PeV energies is Galactic black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Non-Radial Oscillation Modes in Hybrid Stars with Hyperons and Delta Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of hyperons, delta baryons, and quark matter phase transitions on $f$-mode oscillations in neutron stars. Using the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase, we construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) consistent with astrophysical constraints. Including hyperons and delta baryons soften the EoS, reducing maximum mass, while phase transition to the quark matter further softens the EoS, decreasing the speed of sound and hence the maximum mass. We confirm the well-known overestimation of $f$-mode frequencies by the Cowling approximation (by about 10-30\%) compared to full General Relativity calculation, and show that this discrepancy persists across models including hyperons, $\Delta$ baryons, and a phase transition to quark matter. While the discrepancy generally decreases with stellar mass, it increases near the maximum mass in the presence of a phase transition compared to EoSs without this phenomenology. We derive universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density, compactness, and tidal deformability, finding significant deviations due to hyperons and delta baryons. These deviations could provide distinct observational signatures in gravitational wave data, offering new insights into dense matter physics and advancing gravitational wave asteroseismology of neutron star interiors. Empirical relations for mass-scaled and radius-scaled frequencies are also provided, highlighting the importance of GR calculations for accurate modeling.</description>

      <title>Multifrequency Radio Observations of the Magnetar Swift J1818.0--1607</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on Green Bank Telescope observations of the radio magnetar Swift J1818.0--1607 between 820 MHz and 35 GHz, taken from six to nine months after its 2020 March outburst. We obtained multi-hour observations at six frequencies, recording polarimetric, spectral, and single-pulse information. The spectrum peaks at a frequency of $5.4 \pm 0.6$ GHz, making Swift J1818.0--1607 one of many radio magnetars which exhibit a gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS). The radio flux decays steeply above the peak frequency, with in-band spectral indices $\alpha &lt; -2.3 $ above 9 GHz. The emission is highly ($&gt; 50\%$) linearly polarized, with a lower degree ($&lt; 30\%$) of circular polarization which can change handedness between single pulses. Across the frequency range of our observations, the time-integrated radio profiles share a common shape: a narrow ``pulsar-like'' central component flanked by ``magnetar-like'' components comprised of bright, spiky subpulses. The outer profile components exhibit larger degrees of flux modulation and flatter spectral indices when compared to the central pulse component.</description>

      <title>Exploring $\Delta$-resonance in neutron stars: implications from astrophysical and nuclear observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive Bayesian inference of neutron star matter, incorporating $\Delta$-resonances alongside hyperons and nucleons within a density-dependent relativistic hadron (DDRH) framework. Using constraints from nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), NICER radius measurements, and tidal deformability data from GW170817, we systematically explore the impact of $\Delta$-resonances on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter and neutron star observables. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Delta$-baryons softens the EoS at low densities while maintaining sufficient stiffness at high densities to support $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars. This naturally reconciles neutron star radius constraints with the recent observation of the low-mass compact object in HESS J1731-347 while simultaneously exhibiting excellent agreement with GW170817 tidal deformability constraints, reinforcing the astrophysical viability of $\Delta$-admixed neutron stars. Additionally, $\Delta$-resonances are found to populate the outer layers of the neutron star core, which may have implications for neutron star mergers and their cooling. Furthermore, we show that the presence of $\Delta$-baryons might significantly influence neutron star cooling via the direct Urca process. We also investigate quasi-normal $f$-mode oscillations within a fully general relativistic framework, revealing strong correlations between the $f$-mode frequency, neutron star compactness, and tidal deformability. With the inclusion of $\Delta$-resonances and adherence to astrophysical constraints, we obtain $f_{1.4} = 1.97^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$ kHz and the damping time $\tau_{f_{1.4}} = 0.19^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$ s at the $1\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>The polarization of the synchrotron radiation from a recollimated jet: application to high-energy BL Lacs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multifrequency polarimetry, recently extended to the X-ray band thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite, is an essential tool for understanding blazar jets. High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) and extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs) are especially interesting because the polarimetric properties of their synchrotron emission, extending up to the X-ray band, can be fully tracked by sensitive polarimetric measurements. We investigated the polarization properties of the synchrotron emission of these sources, starting directly from relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of recollimated relativistic jets. To bridge the gap between fluid and kinetic scales, we elaborated a post-processing code based on the Lagrangian macroparticle approach, which models the spectral evolution and emission of nonthermal particles within the jet given the local fluid conditions. When comparing our results with early particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we find that shocks formed through jet recollimation are primarily superluminal, limiting particle acceleration in a laminar flow. However, recent PIC simulations suggest that acceleration can occur in the presence of small-scale turbulence or inhomogeneities even in a superluminal configuration. In this case, we reproduce the observed polarization chromaticity (i.e., the polarization degree increases with frequency), along with a stable polarization angle between the X-ray and optical bands. This study sheds light on the role of recollimation shocks in blazar jets and supports the energy-stratified shock model as a plausible explanation for IXPE observations.</description>

      <title>What's kickin' in partial tidal disruption events?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars partially destroyed by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE) can be ejected from the SMBH. Previous investigations attributed this positive-energy/velocity kick to asymmetries in the mass lost by the star near pericenter. We propose that asymmetric mass loss is not predominantly responsible for "kicking" the star, and that these kicks instead arise from the combination of a) the reformation of the core following an initial phase of quasi-ballistic motion, and b) the differential shear between the unbound and marginally bound (to the SMBH) material during this phase. We predict that the kick speed $v_{\rm kick}$ is weakly dependent on the stellar properties, and for SMBH masses $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, $v_{\rm kick}$ is independent of SMBH mass, is not limited to the stellar escape speed $v_{\rm esc}$, and is related to the surviving core mass $M_{\rm c}$ approximately as $v_{\rm kick} \simeq 0.45 \left(M_{\rm c}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/3}$, where $M_{\star}$ is the original stellar mass. For $M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, we find that the maximum-attainable kick speed depends on SMBH mass, satisfies $v_{\rm kick, max} \simeq 0.4 \, v_{\rm esc}\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{1/6}$, and is reached for core masses that satisfy $M_{\rm c}/M_{\star} \lesssim 1.7\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/2}$. This model predicts that massive stars with $M_{\star}\gtrsim few\times 10 M_{\odot}$ could be ejected at speeds $\gtrsim (1-2)\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ if stripped of $\gtrsim 50\%$ of their mass.</description>

      <title>The inner structure and thermodynamics of a thin accretion disc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with electron and proton thermodynamics and an electron cooling function, we probe the inner radial and vertical structure of weakly magnetized geometrically thin accretion discs around rapidly spinning black holes. We find that the thin, cold disc transitions to a thick, hot accretion flow at a radius dependent on the mass accretion rate due to proton-electron Coulomb decoupling. At high accretion rates, the disc truncates close to the innermost stable circular orbit $r\approx2r_g$, demonstrating that even in the canonical thin disc model, the plunging region should be treated with two-temperature physics. At intermediate accretion rates, the transition radius moves outward by a factor of two to $r\approx 5r_g$, forming a radiatively inefficient inner flow. The simulations also reveal extended cooling along the surface of the disc out to $\sim10r_g$, with 40\% of the total cooling at intermediate accretion rates occurring above the disc body. Two-temperature effects also impact the emission from within the plunging region of the black hole, leading to less thermal emission than predicted by single-temperature models. These results have implications for X-ray binary state transitions, the physical origin of the X-ray corona, and spin measurements that rely on determining the location of the innermost stable circular orbit.</description>

      <title>Neutrino pair annihilation driven jets from black-hole torus systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform axisymmetric general relativistic radiation-viscous hydrodynamics simulations of black hole (BH)-torus systems with full Boltzmann Monte-Carlo neutrino transport to investigate the role of neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation in launching relativistic outflows. Our models span a wide range of BH spins, torus masses, and viscosity parameters. We find that the pair annihilation leads to the formation of relativistic fireballs in most cases, except for those with low black-hole spin and high viscosity. The isotropic-equivalent energies of these outflows reach $\lesssim 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$ with durations $\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm s}$. While this is insufficient to explain the brightest short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), our results suggest that the pair annihilation may account for some low-luminosity sGRBs and GRB precursors. We also provide updated scaling relations for the pair annihilation energy deposition rate as a function of accretion rate, and discuss the sensitivity of outflow properties to numerical resolution and floor density.</description>

      <title>Shape and ionization of equatorial matter near compact objects from X-ray polarization reflection signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of the IXPE mission, we elucidate what can be inferred about 3D matter structures forming about the equatorial plane of accreting compact objects from 0.1-100 keV linear polarization induced by non-relativistic large-scale reflection. We construct a model of an optically thick elevated axially symmetric reflecting medium with arbitrary ionization profile, representing the known diverse scattering environments: from thick winds and super-Eddington funnel structures formed around black holes and neutron stars, to Compton-thick dusty tori of active galactic nuclei and their broad line regions. We assume a central X-ray power-law source with an isotropic, cosine, and slab-corona emission distribution, including intrinsic polarization. The reprocessing is based on constant-density local reflection tables produced with a Monte Carlo method combined with detailed non-LTE radiative transfer, although we also show examples with classical (semi-)analytical reflection prescriptions. We conclude that varying ionization has a similarly strong impact on observed polarization as the observer's inclination and the skew and opening angle of the reflector's inner walls, altogether producing up to tens of % of reflected polarization both parallelly or perpendicularly to the projected axis, depending on the parameter values combination. After testing 3 different ad-hoc shapes of the reflector: a cone, an elliptical torus, and a bowl, we conclude that while in some configurations, their altered curvature produces more than 30% absolute difference in observed total polarization, in others, the adopted shape has a marginal impact. Lastly, we discuss the change of the observed polarization due to relaxing the optically thick assumption on equatorial winds and accreted matter, providing a continuous range of energy-dependent examples between the optically thick and thin scenarios.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection in Astrophysical Plasmas: A Powerful Mechanism of Nonthermal Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection -- a fundamental plasma physics process, where magnetic field lines of opposite polarity annihilate -- is invoked in astrophysical plasmas as a powerful mechanism of nonthermal particle acceleration, able to explain fast-evolving, bright high-energy flares. Near black holes and neutron stars, reconnection occurs in the ``relativistic'' regime, in which the mean magnetic energy per particle exceeds the rest mass energy. This review reports recent advances in our understanding of the kinetic physics of relativistic reconnection: (1) Kinetic simulations have elucidated the physics of plasma heating and nonthermal particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection; (2) The physics of radiative relativistic reconnection, with its self-consistent interplay between photons and reconnection-accelerated particles -- a peculiarity of luminous, high-energy astrophysical sources -- is the new frontier of research; (3) Relativistic reconnection plays a key role in global models of high-energy sources, both in terms of global-scale layers, as well as of reconnection sites generated as a byproduct of local magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. We summarize themes of active investigation and future directions, emphasizing the role of upcoming observational capabilities, laboratory experiments, and new computational tools.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Diffusion of $e^\pm$ in Pulsar Halos over Multiple Coherence of Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The slow particle diffusion in pulsar halos, inferred from TeV gamma-ray surface brightness profiles, is attributed to cross-field diffusion under the anisotropic diffusion model. This model assumes sub-Alfv\'enic interstellar turbulence in the surrounding medium of the pulsar and a rough alignment of the line-of-sight of observers towards the pulsars with the local mean magnetic field direction in the halo. In this model, the expected morphology of a pulsar halo is highly dependent on the properties of the interstellar magnetic field. We investigate the anisotropic diffusion of electron-positron pairs across multiple coherence of magnetic fields in pulsar halos in this work. We focus particularly on their influences on the predicted gamma-ray surface brightness profile and the asymmetry of the halo's morphology, as well as the observational expectations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our results indicate that the requirement of a specific magnetic field geometry can be alleviated when accounting for a limited (and realistic) coherence length of the magnetic field in the model. Also, the halo's morphology may appear less asymmetric, especially after being smoothed by the point spread function of instruments. It largely relaxes the tension between the asymmetric morphology of halos predicted by the model and lack of apparent asymmetric halos detected so far. Our findings demonstrate the important influence of the coherence length of interstellar magnetic field on the distribution of particles around their accelerators, and the consequence on the measured source morphology.</description>

      <title>The $R$-Process Alliance: Enrichment of $r$-process Elements in a Simulated Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of stars with varying amounts of heavy elements synthesized by the rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) based on our detailed cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with an $N$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, ASURA. Most stars with no overabundance in $r$-process elements, as well as the strongly $r$-process enhanced $r$-II stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt;+0.7$), are formed in dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way within the 6 Gyr after the Big Bang. In contrast, over half of the moderately enhanced $r$-I stars ($+0.3 &lt;$ [Eu/Fe] $\leq +0.7$) are formed in the main in-situ disk after 6 Gyr. Our results suggest that the fraction of $r$-I and $r$-II stars formed in disrupted dwarf galaxies is larger the higher their [Eu/Fe] is. Accordingly, the most strongly enhanced $r$-III stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt; +2.0$) are formed in accreted components. These results suggest that non-$r$-process-enhanced stars and $r$-II stars are mainly formed in low-mass dwarf galaxies that hosted either none or a single neutron star merger, while the $r$-I stars tend to form in the well-mixed in-situ disk. We compare our findings with high-resolution spectroscopic observations of $r$-process-enhanced metal-poor stars in the halo and dwarf galaxies, including those collected by the R-Process Alliance. We conclude that observed [Eu/Fe] and [Eu/Mg] ratios can be employed in chemical tagging of the Milky Way's accretion history.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Exotic energy injections from dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking evaporation can alter the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm global spectrum. We assess the potential of the upcoming space project, the Hongmeng mission, to probe dark matter particles and PBHs using the 21 cm global spectrum. Under ideal conditions with 1000 hours of integration time and negligible foreground residuals, the Hongmeng project can reach sensitivities to dark matter annihilation cross sections and decay lifetimes to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^3\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim 10^{28}\,\mathrm{s}$, respectively, for dark matter particles with a mass of $10\,\mathrm{GeV}$. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances as low as $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the Hongmeng mission can improve current constraints on dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the Hongmeng mission surpasses current limits on sub-GeV dark matter probing and enables the probing of Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,\mathrm{g}$, which remain undetectable through conventional cosmological means. Overall, the upcoming Hongmeng project holds great promise for advancing the investigation of both dark matter and PBHs, potentially deepening our understanding of the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The XMAGNET exascale MHD simulations of SMBH feedback in galaxy groups and clusters: Overview and preliminary cluster results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present initial results from extremely well-resolved 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of idealized galaxy clusters, conducted using the AthenaPK code on the Frontier exascale supercomputer. These simulations explore the self-regulation of galaxy groups and cool-core clusters by cold gas-triggered active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback incorporating magnetized kinetic jets. Our simulation campaign includes simulations of galaxy groups and clusters with a range of masses and intragroup and intracluster medium properties. In this paper we present results that focus on a Perseus-like cluster. We find that the simulated clusters are self-regulating, with the cluster cores staying at a roughly constant thermodynamic state and AGN jet power staying at physically reasonable values ($\simeq 10^{44}-10^{45}$~erg/s) for billions of years without a discernible duty cycle. These simulations also produce significant amounts of cold gas, with calculations having strong magnetic fields generally both promoting cold gas formation and allowing cold gas out to much larger clustercentric radii ($\simeq 100$~kpc) than simulations with weak or no fields ($\simeq 10$~kpc), and also having more filamentary cold gas morphology. We find that AGN feedback significantly increases the strength of magnetic fields at the center of the cluster. We also find that the magnetized turbulence generated by the AGN results in turbulence where the velocity power spectra are tied to AGN activity whereas the magnetic energy spectra are much less impacted after reaching a stationary state.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses - axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics - based on Airy function approximations - which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius - as it is in electromagnetic lensing - making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test gyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime--an exact electrovacuum solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic field strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong field regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near rotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes and naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to differentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic fields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends sensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the collapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic fields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a long-range $1/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test gyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1/r^3$ falloff. In addition, we obtain the exact geodetic precession (gravitoelectric effect) frequency for a gyroscope in magnetized Schwarzschild spacetime, showing that the magnetic field enhances ($\propto r^{1/2}$) geodetic precession in contrast to the standard $1/r^{5/2}$ falloff. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field behavior of spin precession could have important implications for transmuted black holes formed via collapse or mergers of magnetized progenitors in both astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>A waveform and time digitization mainboard prototype for the hybrid digital optical module of TRIDENT neutrino experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The TRIDENT (Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope) experiment is a next-generation underwater neutrino observatory planned for deployment in the West Pacific Ocean, designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation. The full-scale detector will consist of approximately 1000 vertical strings, each equipped with 20 hybrid digital optical modules (hDOMs) containing both photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for comprehensive light detection. This paper presents a custom-designed digitization mainboard prototype for the hDOM, featuring simultaneous 32-channel PMT waveform digitization at 125 MS/s using commercial analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and 56-channel high-precision time measurement through field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-implemented time-to-digital converters (TDCs). The system demonstrates excellent performance in single photoelectron (SPE) detection with clear pedestal separation, maintains linear response up to 240 PEs, and achieves sub-nanosecond timing resolution for PMT or SiPM pulse edges.</description>
