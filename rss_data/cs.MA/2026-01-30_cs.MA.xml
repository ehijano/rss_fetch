      <title>AI-Augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) for Decentralized Environmental Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an AI-augmented decentralized framework for multi-agent (multi-robot) environmental mapping under limited sensing and communication. While conventional coverage formulations achieve effective spatial allocation when an accurate reference map is available, their performance deteriorates under uncertain or biased priors. The proposed method introduces an adaptive and self-correcting mechanism that enables agents to iteratively refine local density estimates within an optimal transport-based framework, ensuring theoretical consistency and scalability. A dual multilayer perceptron (MLP) module enhances adaptivity by inferring local mean-variance statistics and regulating virtual uncertainty for long-unvisited regions, mitigating stagnation around local minima. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves convergence under the Wasserstein metric, while simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AI-augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control consistently achieves robust and precise alignment with the ground-truth density, yielding substantially higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex multi-modal spatial distributions compared with conventional decentralized baselines.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Control on Sparse Graphs: From Local Limits to GNNs via Neighborhood Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field control (MFC) offers a scalable solution to the curse of dimensionality in multi-agent systems but traditionally hinges on the restrictive assumption of exchangeability via dense, all-to-all interactions. In this work, we bridge the gap to real-world network structures by proposing a rigorous framework for MFC on large sparse graphs. We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions. Furthermore, we formally and experimentally justify the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for actor-critic algorithms in this context. Our framework naturally recovers classical MFC as a degenerate case while enabling efficient, theoretically grounded control on complex sparse topologies.</description>

      <title>Learning to Communicate Across Modalities: Perceptual Heterogeneity in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent communication offers insight into how agents develop shared structured representations, yet most research assumes homogeneous modalities or aligned representational spaces, overlooking the perceptual heterogeneity of real-world settings. We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication. This work positions emergent communication as a framework for studying how agents adapt and transfer representations across heterogeneous modalities, opening new directions for both theory and experimentation.</description>

      <title>Micro-mobility dispatch optimization via quantum annealing incorporating historical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dispatch formulation for micro-mobility vehicles using a Quantum Annealer (QA). In recent years, QA has gained increasing attention as a high-performance solver for combinatorial optimization problems. Meanwhile, micro-mobility services have been rapidly developed as a promising means of realizing efficient and sustainable urban transportation. In this study, the dispatch problem for such micro-mobility services is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling efficient solving through QA. Furthermore, the proposed formulation incorporates historical usage data to enhance operational efficiency. Specifically, customer arrival frequencies and destination distributions are modeled into the QUBO formulation through a Bayesian approach, which guides the allocation of vacant vehicles to designated stations for waiting and charging. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparisons to conventional formulations such as the vehicle routing problem. Additionally, the performance of QA is compared with that of classical solvers to reveal its potential advantages for the proposed dispatch formulation. The effect of reverse annealing on improving solution quality is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Meta-ROS: A Next-Generation Middleware Architecture for Adaptive and Scalable Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of robotics faces significant challenges related to the complexity and interoperability of existing middleware frameworks, like ROS2, which can be difficult for new developers to adopt. To address these issues, we propose Meta-ROS, a novel middleware solution designed to streamline robotics development by simplifying integration, enhancing performance, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Meta-ROS leverages modern communication protocols, such as Zenoh and ZeroMQ, to enable efficient and low-latency communication across diverse hardware platforms, while also supporting various data types like audio, images, and video. We evaluated Meta-ROS's performance through comprehensive testing, comparing it with existing middleware frameworks like ROS1 and ROS2. The results demonstrated that Meta-ROS outperforms ROS2, achieving up to 30% higher throughput, significantly reducing message latency, and optimizing resource usage. Additionally, its robust hardware support and developer-centric design facilitate seamless integration and ease of use, positioning Meta-ROS as an ideal solution for modern, real-time robotics AI applications.</description>

      <title>Planner-Auditor Twin: Agentic Discharge Planning with FHIR-Based LLM Planning, Guideline Recall, Optional Caching and Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.</description>

      <title>DataCross: A Unified Benchmark and Agent Framework for Cross-Modal Heterogeneous Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.</description>

      <title>Opinion Consensus Formation Among Networked Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can classical consensus models predict the group behavior of large language models (LLMs)? We examine multi-round interactions among LLM agents through the DeGroot framework, where agents exchange text-based messages over diverse communication graphs. To track opinion evolution, we map each message to an opinion score via sentiment analysis. We find that agents typically reach consensus and the disagreement between the agents decays exponentially. However, the limiting opinion departs from DeGroot's network-centrality-weighted forecast. The consensus between LLM agents turns out to be largely insensitive to initial conditions and instead depends strongly on the discussion subject and inherent biases. Nevertheless, transient dynamics align with classical graph theory and the convergence rate of opinions is closely related to the second-largest eigenvalue of the graph's combination matrix. Together, these findings can be useful for LLM-driven social-network simulations and the design of resource-efficient multi-agent LLM applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Culturally Aligned LLMs through Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Context Learning: Building Trust the Right Way in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Continual Learning for Mobile Edge UAV Networks: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of coordinating mobile edge UAV networks to maintain robust service in highly dynamic spatiotemporal environments. Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when transitioning between distinct task scenarios, such as moving from dense urban clusters to sparse rural areas. These transitions typically necessitate computationally expensive retraining or model resets to adapt to new user distributions, leading to service interruptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a computationally efficient Spatiotemporal Continual Learning (STCL) framework realized through a Group-Decoupled Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (G-MAPPO) algorithm. Our approach integrates a novel Group-Decoupled Policy Optimization (GDPO) mechanism that utilizes dynamic $z$-score normalization to autonomously balance heterogeneous objectives, including energy efficiency, user fairness, and coverage. This mechanism effectively mitigates gradient conflicts induced by concept drifts without requiring offline retraining. Furthermore, the framework leverages the 3D mobility of UAVs as a spatial compensation layer, enabling the swarm to autonomously adjust altitudes to accommodate extreme density fluctuations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed STCL framework achieves superior resilience, characterized by an elastic recovery of service reliability to approximately 0.95 during phase transitions. Compared to the MADDPG baseline, G-MAPPO not only prevents knowledge forgetting but also delivers an effective capacity gain of 20\% under extreme traffic loads, validating its potential as a scalable solution for edge-enabled aerial swarms.</description>

Abstract: Given the emergence of Generative AI over the last two years and the increasing focus on Agentic AI as a form of Multi-Agent System it is important to explore both how such technologies can impact the use of traditional Agent Toolkits and how the wealth of experience encapsulated in those toolkits can influence the design of the new agentic platforms. This paper presents an overview of our experience developing a prototype large language model (LLM) integration for the ASTRA programming language. It presents a brief overview of the toolkit, followed by three example implementations, concluding with a discussion of the experiences garnered through the examples.</description>

      <title>Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL/releases/tag/v1.3.2.</description>

      <title>Generalized Information Gathering Under Dynamics Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Empowering Scientific Workflows with Federated Agents</title>

Abstract: Agentic systems, in which diverse agents cooperate to tackle challenging problems, are exploding in popularity in the AI community. However, existing agentic frameworks take a relatively narrow view of agents, apply a centralized model, and target conversational, cloud-native applications (e.g., LLM-based AI chatbots). In contrast, scientific applications require myriad agents be deployed and managed across diverse cyberinfrastructure. Here we introduce Academy, a modular and extensible middleware designed to deploy autonomous agents across the federated research ecosystem, including HPC systems, experimental facilities, and data repositories. To meet the demands of scientific computing, Academy supports asynchronous execution, heterogeneous resources, high-throughput data flows, and dynamic resource availability. It provides abstractions for expressing stateful agents, managing inter-agent coordination, and integrating computation with experimental control. We present microbenchmark results that demonstrate high performance and scalability in HPC environments. To explore the breadth of applications that can be supported by agentic workflow designs, we also present case studies in materials discovery, astronomy, decentralized learning, and information extraction in which agents are deployed across diverse HPC systems.</description>

      <title>Agents Trusting Agents? Restoring Lost Capabilities with Inclusive Healthcare</title>

Abstract: Agent-based simulations have an untapped potential to inform social policies on urgent human development challenges in a non-invasive way, before these are implemented in real-world populations. This paper responds to the request from non-profit and governmental organizations to evaluate policies under discussion to improve equity in health care services for people experiencing homelessness (PEH) in the city of Barcelona. With this goal, we integrate the conceptual framework of the capability approach (CA), which is explicitly designed to promote and assess human well-being, to model and evaluate the behaviour of agents who represent PEH and social workers. We define a reinforcement learning environment where agents aim to restore their central human capabilities, under existing environmental and legal constraints. We use Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to calibrate profile-dependent behavioural parameters in PEH agents, modeling the degree of trust and engagement with social workers, which is reportedly a key element for the success of the policies in scope. Our results open a path to mitigate health inequity by building relationships of trust between social service workers and PEH.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Swarm Mesh Refinement using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Local Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating physical systems is essential in engineering, but analytical solutions are limited to straightforward problems. Consequently, numerical methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM) are widely used. However, the FEM becomes computationally expensive as problem complexity and accuracy demands increase. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) improves the FEM by dynamically placing mesh elements on the domain, balancing computational speed and accuracy. Classical AMR depends on heuristics or expensive error estimators, which may lead to suboptimal performance for complex simulations. While AMR methods based on machine learning are promising, they currently only scale to simple problems. In this work, we formulate AMR as a system of collaborating, homogeneous agents that iteratively split into multiple new agents. This agent-wise perspective enables a spatial reward formulation focused on reducing the maximum mesh element error. Our approach, Adaptive Swarm Mesh Refinement++ (ASMR++), offers efficient, stable optimization and generates highly adaptive meshes at user-defined resolution at inference time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASMR++ outperforms heuristic approaches and learned baselines, matching the performance of expensive error-based oracle AMR strategies. ASMR additionally generalizes to different domains during inference, and produces meshes that simulate up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than uniform refinements in more demanding settings.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cultural Attractors as Conceptual Tools to Evaluate LLMs in Multi-turn Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Performance bound analysis of linear consensus algorithm on strongly connected graphs using effective resistance and reversiblization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of the linear consensus algorithm on strongly connected directed graphs using the linear quadratic (LQ) cost as a performance measure. In particular, we derive bounds on the LQ cost by leveraging effective resistance and reversiblization. Our results extend previous analyses-which were limited to reversible cases-to the nonreversible setting. To facilitate this generalization, we introduce novel concepts, termed the back-and-forth path and the pivot node, which serve as effective alternatives to traditional techniques that require reversibility. Moreover, we apply our approach to Cayley graphs and random geometric graphs to estimate the LQ cost without the reversibility assumption. The proposed approach provides a framework that can be adapted to other contexts where reversibility is typically assumed.</description>

      <title>Reputation as a Solution to Cooperation Collapse in LLM-based MASs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperation has long been a fundamental topic in both human society and AI systems. However, recent studies indicate that the collapse of cooperation may emerge in multi-agent systems (MASs) driven by large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we explore reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic, dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for future interactions. Through three distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet effectively avoids cooperation collapse, promoting and sustaining cooperation in LLM-based MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can give rise to rich emergent behaviors in LLM-based MASs, such as the formation of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones. The GitHub repository for our project can be accessed via the following link: https://github.com/RGB-0000FF/RepuNet.</description>

      <title>TransLaw: A Large-Scale Dataset and Multi-Agent Benchmark Simulating Professional Translation of Hong Kong Case Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hong Kong case law translation presents significant challenges: manual methods suffer from high costs and inconsistent quality, while both traditional machine translation and approaches relying solely on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to ensure legal terminology accuracy, culturally embedded nuances, and strict linguistic structures. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes TransLaw, a multi-agent framework that decomposes translation into word-level expression, sentence-level translation, and multidimensional review, integrating a specialized Hong Kong legal glossary database, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and iterative feedback. Experiments on our newly constructed HKCFA Judgment 97-22 dataset, benchmarking 13 open-source and commercial LLMs, demonstrate that TransLaw significantly outperforms single-agent baselines across all evaluated models. Human evaluation confirms the framework's effectiveness in terms of legal semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, while noting that it still trails human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.</description>

      <title>The Price of Uncertainty for Social Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How hard is it to achieve consensus in a social network under uncertainty? In this paper we model this problem as a social graph of agents where each vertex is initially colored red or blue. The goal of the agents is to achieve consensus, which is when the colors of all agents align. Agents attempt to do this locally through steps in which an agent changes their color to the color of the majority of their neighbors. In real life, agents may not know exactly how many of their neighbors are red or blue, which introduces uncertainty into this process. Modeling uncertainty as perturbations of relative magnitude $1+\varepsilon$ to these color neighbor counts, we show that even small values of $\varepsilon$ greatly hinder the ability to achieve consensus in a social network. We prove theoretically tight upper and lower bounds on the \emph{price of uncertainty}, a metric defined in previous work by Balcan et al. to quantify the effect of uncertainty in network games.</description>

      <title>What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of the Condorcet winner and loser criteria with positive or negative involvement and resolvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10506v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and $n$-voter resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding some set of up to $n$ voters). This impossibility theorem holds for any positive integer $n$. In addition, positive involvement can be replaced by negative involvement (if a candidate $x$ loses in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely last cannot cause $x$ to win). In a previous note, we proved an analogous result assuming an additional axiom of ordinal margin invariance, which we now show is unnecessary for an impossibility theorem, at least if the desired voting method is defined for five-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>MAS-Orchestra: Understanding and Improving Multi-Agent Reasoning Through Holistic Orchestration and Controlled Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While multi-agent systems (MAS) promise elevated intelligence through coordination of agents, current approaches to automatic MAS design under-deliver. Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MASOrchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented subagents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and subagents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA, while achieving more than 10x efficiency over strong baselines. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Orchestrators: Constraint-Compliant Multi-Agent Optimization for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.</description>
