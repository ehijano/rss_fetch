      <title>Wave function matching transformation for solving the quantum many-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for solving quantum many-body systems called wave function matching. Wave function matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wave functions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancelations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Constraints for the Equation of State of Dense and Hot Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review aims at providing an extensive discussion of modern constraints relevant for dense and hot strongly interacting matter. It includes theoretical first-principle results from lattice and perturbative QCD, as well as chiral effective field theory results. From the experimental side, it includes heavy-ion collision and low-energy nuclear physics results, as well as observations from neutron stars and their mergers. The validity of different constraints, concerning specific conditions and ranges of applicability, is also provided.</description>

      <title>Design, construction, and operation of a 1-ton Water-based Liquid scintillator detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13231v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water-based liquid scintillators (WbLS) are attractive neutrino detector materials because they allow us to tune the ratio of the Cherenkov and scintillation signals. Using WbLS large-scale neutrino experiments can benefit from both directional reconstruction and enhanced low-energy efficiency. Furthermore, broadening the science capability of such materials by metal doping may be better suited for water based liquid scintillators. We recently constructed and commissioned a 1-ton WbLS detector with good photosensor coverage and a capable data acquisition system. We intend to use this flexible detector system as a testbed for WbLS R&amp;D. In this paper we give an overview of the 1-ton system and provide some early analysis results.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the charge radii difference in mirror partner nuclei and the symmetry energy slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A correlation between the charge radii difference of mirror partner nuclei $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and the slope parameter $L$ of symmetry energy has been built to ascertain the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. In this work, the influences of pairing correlations and isoscalar compression modulus on the \Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ are systematically investigated based on the Skyrme energy density functional theory. The calculated results suggest that the linear correlation between $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and $L$ is decreased by the surface pairing correlations. The slope parameter deduced from the difference of charge radii of mirror-pair nuclei $^{32}$Ar-$^{32}$Si, $^{36}$Ca-$^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca-$^{38}$Ar, and $^{54}$Ni-$^{54}$Fe falls into the range of $L=42.57$-$50.64$ MeV, that is, the rather soft equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter. Besides, the range of the slope parameter can also be influenced by the effective forces classified by various isoscalar incompressibility coefficients.</description>
