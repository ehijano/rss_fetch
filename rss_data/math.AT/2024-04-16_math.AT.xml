      <title>Semi-coarse Spaces: Fundamental Groupoid and the van Kampen Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In algebraic topology, the fundamental groupoid is a classical homotopy invariant which is defined using continuous maps from the closed interval to a topological space. In this paper, we construct a semi-coarse version of this invariant, using as paths a finite sequences of maps from $\mathbb{Z}_1$ to a semi-coarse space, connecting their tails through semi-coarse homotopy. In contrast to semi-coarse homotopy groups, this groupoid is not necessarily trivial for coarse spaces, and, unlike coarse homotopy, it is well-defined for general semi-coarse spaces. In addition, we show that the semi-coarse fundamental groupoid which we introduce admits a version of the Van Kampen Theorem.</description>

      <title>A stable splitting for spaces of commuting elements in unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an analogue of Miller's stable splitting of the unitary group $U(m)$ for spaces of commuting elements in $U(m)$. After inverting $m!$, the space $\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}^n,U(m))$ splits stably as a wedge of Thom-like spaces of bundles of commuting varieties over certain partial flag manifolds. Using Steenrod operations we prove that our splitting does not hold integrally. Analogous decompositions for symplectic and orthogonal groups as well as homological results for the one-point compactification of the commuting variety in a Lie algebra are also provided.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial Massey products on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the bigraded quasi-isomorphism type of the bigraded, bidifferential algebra of forms on a compact K\"ahler manifold generally contains more information than the de Rham cohomology algebra with its real Hodge structure. More precisely, on any closed Riemann surface of genus at least two, there is a nontrivial ABC-Massey product. Furthermore, starting from dimension three, there are simply connected projective manifolds with a nonzero ABC-Massey product of three divisor classes. In particular, compact K\"ahler manifolds are generally not formal in the sense of pluripotential homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Currents on Cohesive Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on a complex variety $X$ that has a locally free resolution $E^{\bullet}$. In [19], the authors constructed a pseudomeromorphic current whose support is contained in $supp(E^{\bullet})$ that represents products of Chern classes of $\mathcal{F}.$ In this paper, we show that their construction works for general de-Rham characteristic classes and then generalize it to represent products (in de-Rham cohomology) of characteristic forms of cohesive modules defined by Block. Finally, we state a corollary to a transgression result in [16] that show that it is sufficient to only use the degree-$0$ and degree-$1$ parts of the superconnection to construct currents that represent characteristic forms of cohesive modules in the Bott-Chern cohomology.</description>

      <title>Derived geometric Satake for $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{\times 3}/\mathrm{PGL}_2^\mathrm{diag}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the local relative geometric Langlands conjecture of Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh for the spherical subgroup $\mathrm{PGL}_2^\mathrm{diag}$ of the triple product $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{\times 3}$ (and also for the spherical subgroup $\mathrm{G}_2$ of $\mathrm{SO}_8/\mu_2$), whose corresponding Langlands dual $\mathrm{SL}_2^{\times 3}$-variety can be identified with the symplectic vector space $(\mathbf{A}^2)^{\otimes 3} \cong \mathbf{A}^8$ of $2\times 2 \times 2$-cubes. Our analysis relies on a construction of Bhargava relating $2 \times 2 \times 2$-cubes to Gauss composition on quadratic forms, arising here as the moment map for the Hamiltonian $\mathrm{SL}_2^{\times 3}$-action on $(\mathbf{A}^2)^{\otimes 3}$, and the Cayley hyperdeterminant as studied by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky.</description>

      <title>ku-theoretic spectral decompositions for spheres and projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh described a conjectural extension of the geometric Satake equivalence to spherical varieties, whose spectral decomposition is described by Hamiltonian varieties. The goal of this article is to study their conjecture, especially in the case of spherical varieties of relative rank 1, using tools from homotopy theory. Our discussion relates their conjecture to classical topics in homotopy theory such as the EHP sequence and Hopf fibrations, as well as more modern topics such as Hochschild (co)homology. We will also study an analogue of the derived geometric Satake equivalence and of the Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh conjecture with coefficients in connective complex K-theory. In this generalized setting, the dual group (a la Langlands, Gaitsgory--Nadler, Sakellaridis--Venkatesh, Knop--Schalke) remains unchanged, but the specific dual "representation" of the dual group changes. On the spectral/Langlands dual side, we expect that the appropriate replacement of Hamiltonian varieties are given by what we term "ku-Hamiltonian varieties"; this is a notion interpolating between Hamiltonian and quasi-Hamiltonian varieties (a la Alekseev--Malkin--Meinrenken). Finally, we suggest possible generalizations to more exotic cohomology theories such as complex cobordism.</description>

      <title>On the rank of the double cohomology of moment-angle complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [6], the authors construct a cochain complex $C\!H^*(\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}})$ on the cohomology of a moment-angle complex $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}}$ and call the resulting cohomology the double cohomology, $H\!H^*(\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}})$. In this paper, we study the change of rank in double cohomology after gluing an $n$-simplex to a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ in certain conditions. As an application, we give a positive answer to an open problem in [6]: For any even integer $r$, there always exists a simlicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ such that $\operatorname{rank} H\!H^*(\mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{K}})=r$.</description>

      <title>A quadratic estimation for the K\"uhnel conjecture on embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04188v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Heawood inequality states that if the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is embeddable in the sphere with $g$ handles, then $g \ge\dfrac{(n-3)(n-4)}{12}$. A higher-dimensional analogue of the Heawood inequality is the K\"uhnel conjecture. In a simplified form it states that for every integer $k&gt;0$ there is $c_k&gt;0$ such that if the union of $k$-faces of $n$-simplex embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge c_k n^{k+1}$. For $k&gt;1$ only linear estimates were known. We present a quadratic estimate $g\ge c_k n^2$. The proof is based on beautiful and fruitful interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11836v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An action of a complex reductive group $\mathrm G$ on a smooth projective variety $X$ is regular when all regular unipotent elements in $\mathrm G$ act with finitely many fixed points. Then the complex $\mathrm G$-equivariant cohomology ring of $X$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of a certain regular fixed point scheme. Examples include partial flag varieties, smooth Schubert varieties and Bott-Samelson varieties. We also show that a more general version of the fixed point scheme allows a generalisation to GKM spaces, such as toric varieties.</description>

Abstract: We construct, for all $g\geq 2$ and $n\geq 0$, a spectral sequence of rational $S_n$-representations which computes the $S_n$-equivariant reduced rational cohomology of the tropical moduli spaces of curves $\Delta_{g,n}$ in terms of compactly supported cohomology groups of configuration spaces of $n$ points on graphs of genus $g$. Using the canonical $S_n$-equivariant isomorphisms $\widetilde{H}^{i-1}(\Delta_{g,n};\mathbb{Q}) \cong W_0 H^i_c(\mathcal{M}_{g,n};\mathbb{Q})$, we calculate the weight $0$, compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ in the range $g=3$ and $n\leq 9$, with partial computations available for $n\leq 13$.</description>

      <title>Global anomalies &amp; bordism of non-supersymmetric strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three tachyon-free non-supersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions provide a handle on quantum gravity away from the supersymmetric lamppost. However, they have not been shown to be fully consistent; although local anomalies cancel due to versions of the Green-Schwarz mechanism, there could be global anomalies, not cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism, that could become fatal pathologies. We compute the twisted string bordism groups that control these anomalies via the Adams spectral sequence, showing that they vanish completely in two out of three cases (Sugimoto and $SO(16)^2$) and showing a partial vanishing also in the third (Sagnotti 0'B model). We also compute lower-dimensional bordism groups of the non-supersymmetric string theories, which are of interest to the classification of branes in these theories via the Cobordism Conjecture. We propose a worldvolume content based on anomaly inflow for the $SO(16)^2$ NS5-brane, and discuss subtleties related to the torsion part of the Bianchi identity. As a byproduct of our techniques and analysis, we also reprove that the outer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ automorphism swapping the two $E_8$ factors in the supersymmetric heterotic string is also non-anomalous.</description>

      <title>Weighted Combinatorial Laplacian and its Application to Coverage Repair in Sensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the weighted combinatorial Laplacian operators on a simplicial complex and investigate their spectral properties. Eigenvalues close to zero and the corresponding eigenvectors of them are especially of our interest, and we show that they can detect almost $n$-dimensional holes in the given complex. Real-valued weights on simplices allow gradient descent based optimization, which in turn gives an efficient dynamic coverage repair algorithm for the sensor network of a mobile robot team. Using the theory of relative homology, we also extend the problem of dynamic coverage repair to environments with obstacles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from the circle with its geodesic metric to any simply connected geodesic space is never smaller than $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We also prove that this bound is tight through the construction of a simply connected geodesic space $\mathrm{E}$ which attains the lower bound $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We deduce the first statement from a general result that we also establish which gives conditions on how small the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two geodesic metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y )$ has to be in order for $\pi_1(X)$ and $\pi_1(Y)$ to be isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of augmented $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the {\em stabilization} of the infinity category of augmented $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>
