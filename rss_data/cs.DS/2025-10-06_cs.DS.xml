      <title>Even Faster Kernel Matrix Linear Algebra via Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) for linear algebraic tasks involving the kernel matrix of a collection of $n$ data points in $\mathbb R^d$. In particular, we improve upon existing algorithms for computing the following up to $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error: matrix-vector products, matrix-matrix products, the spectral norm, and sum of all entries. The runtimes of our algorithms depend on the dimension $d$, the number of points $n$, and the target error $\varepsilon$. Importantly, the dependence on $n$ in each case is far lower when accessing the kernel matrix through KDE queries as opposed to reading individual entries.
  Our improvements over existing best algorithms (particularly those of Backurs, Indyk, Musco, and Wagner '21) for these tasks reduce the polynomial dependence on $\varepsilon$, and additionally decreases the dependence on $n$ in the case of computing the sum of all entries of the kernel matrix.
  We complement our upper bounds with several lower bounds for related problems, which provide (conditional) quadratic time hardness results and additionally hint at the limits of KDE based approaches for the problems we study.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Fault-Tolerant Strong Connectivity Preservers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-fault-tolerant connectivity preserver of a directed $n$-vertex graph $G$ is a subgraph $H$ such that, for any edge set $F \subseteq E(G)$ of size $|F| \le k$, the strongly connected components of $G - F$ and $H - F$ are the same. While some graphs require a preserver with $\Omega(2^{k}n)$ edges [BCR18], the best-known upper bound is $\tilde{O}(k2^{k}n^{2-1/k})$ edges [CC20], leaving a significant gap of $\Omega(n^{1-1/k})$. In contrast, there is no gap in undirected graphs; the optimal bound of $\Theta(kn)$ has been well-established since the 90s [NI92].
  We nearly close the gap for directed graphs; we prove that there exists a $k$-fault-tolerant connectivity preserver with $O(k4^{k}n\log n)$ edges, and we can construct one with $O(8^{k}n\log^{5/2}n)$ edges in $\text{poly}(2^{k}n)$ time.
  Our results also improve the state-of-the-art for a closely related object; a \textit{$k$-connectivity preserver} of $G$ is a subgraph $H$ where, for all $i \le k$, the strongly $i$-connected components of $G$ and $H$ agree. By a known reduction, we obtain a $k$-connectivity preserver with $O(k4^{k}n\log n)$ edges, improving the previous best bound of $\tilde{O}(k2^{k}n^{2-1/(k-1)})$ [CC20]. Therefore, for any constant $k$, our results are optimal to a $\log n$ factor for both problems.
  Lastly, we show that the exponential dependency on $k$ is not inherent for $k$-connectivity preservers by presenting another construction with $O(n \sqrt{kn})$ edges.</description>

      <title>Congestion bounds via Laplacian eigenvalues and their application to tensor networks with arbitrary geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding the vertices of arbitrary graphs into trees while minimizing some measure of overlap is an important problem with applications in computer science and physics. In this work, we consider the problem of bijectively embedding the vertices of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ into the leaves of an $n$-leaf rooted binary tree $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion of such an embedding is given by the largest size of the cut induced by the two components obtained by deleting any vertex of $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion $\mathrm{cng}(G)$ is defined as the minimum congestion obtained by any embedding. We show that $\lambda_2(G)\cdot 2n/9\le \mathrm{cng} (G)\le \lambda_n(G)\cdot 2n/9$, where $0=\lambda_1(G)\le \cdots \le \lambda_n(G)$ are the Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$. We also provide a contraction heuristic given by hierarchically spectral clustering the original graph, which we numerically find to be effective in finding low congestion embeddings for sparse graphs. We numerically compare our congestion bounds on different families of graphs with regular structure (hypercubes and lattices), random graphs, and tensor network representations of quantum circuits. Our results imply lower and upper bounds on the memory complexity of tensor network contraction in terms of the underlying graph.</description>

      <title>On the Enumeration of all Unique Paths of Recombining Trinomial Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recombining trinomial trees are a workhorse for modeling discrete-event systems in option pricing, logistics, and feedback control. Because each node stores a state-dependent quantity, a depth-$D$ tree naively yields $\mathcal{O}(3^{D})$ trajectories, making exhaustive enumeration infeasible. Under time-homogeneous dynamics, however, the graph exhibits two exploitable symmetries: (i) translational invariance of nodes and (ii) a canonical bijection between admissible paths and ordered tuples encoding weak compositions. Leveraging these, we introduce a mass-shifting enumeration algorithm that slides integer "masses" through a cardinality tuple to generate exactly one representative per path-equivalence class while implicitly counting the associated weak compositions. This trims the search space by an exponential factor, enabling markedly deeper trees -- and therefore tighter numerical approximations of the underlying evolution -- to be processed in practice. We further derive an upper bound on the combinatorial counting expression that induces a theoretical lower bound on the algorithmic cost of approximately $\mathcal{O}\bigl(D^{1/2}1.612^{D}\bigr)$. This correspondence permits direct benchmarking while empirical tests, whose pseudo-code we provide, corroborate the bound, showing only a small constant overhead and substantial speedups over classical breadth-first traversal. Finally, we highlight structural links between our algorithmic/combinatorial framework and Motzkin paths with Narayana-type refinements, suggesting refined enumerative formulas and new potential analytic tools for path-dependent functionals.</description>

      <title>Pareto-optimal Non-uniform Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed an interesting model for language generation in the limit: Given a countable collection of languages, and an adversary enumerating the strings of some language $L$ from the collection, the objective is to generate new strings from the target language, such that all strings generated beyond some finite time are valid. Li, Raman and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order. However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal.
  In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\star(L)$ are (almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\star(L)$, must satisfy that its generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than $t^\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.</description>

      <title>Low Recourse Arborescence Forests Under Uniformly Random Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study how to maintain a forest of arborescences of maximum arc cardinality under arc insertions while minimizing recourse -- the total number of arcs changed in the maintained solution. This problem is the "arborescence version'' of max cardinality matching.
  On the impossibility side, we observe that even in this insertion-only model, it is possible for $m$ adversarial arc arrivals to necessarily incur $\Omega(m \cdot n)$ recourse, matching a trivial upper bound of $O(m \cdot n)$. On the possibility side, we give an algorithm with expected recourse $O(m \cdot \log^2 n)$ if all $m$ arcs arrive uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Oracle-based Uniform Sampling from Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to sample a uniform distribution on a convex body $K$. Our algorithms are based on the Alternating Sampling Framework/proximal sampler, which uses Gibbs sampling on an augmented distribution and assumes access to the so-called restricted Gaussian oracle (RGO). The key contribution of this work is the efficient implementation of RGO for uniform sampling on $K$ via rejection sampling and access to either a projection oracle or a separation oracle on $K$. In both oracle cases, we establish non-asymptotic complexities to obtain unbiased samples where the accuracy is measured in R\'enyi divergence or $\chi^2$-divergence.</description>

      <title>Smooth Trade-off for Tensor PCA via Sharp Bounds for Kikuchi Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit algorithms for Tensor PCA: given an order-$r$ tensor of the form $T = G+\lambda \cdot v^{\otimes r}$ where $G$ is a random symmetric Gaussian tensor with unit variance entries and $v$ is an unknown boolean vector in $\{\pm 1\}^n$, what's the minimum $\lambda$ at which one can distinguish $T$ from a random Gaussian tensor and more generally, recover $v$? As a result of a long line of work, we know that for any $\ell \in \N$, there is a $n^{O(\ell)}$ time algorithm that succeeds when the signal strength $\lambda \gtrsim \sqrt{\log n} \cdot n^{-r/4} \cdot \ell^{1/2-r/4}$. The question of whether the logarithmic factor is necessary turns out to be crucial to understanding whether larger polynomial time allows recovering the signal at a lower signal strength. Such a smooth trade-off is necessary for tensor PCA being a candidate problem for quantum speedups[SOKB25]. It was first conjectured by [WAM19] and then, more recently, with an eye on smooth trade-offs, reiterated in a blogpost of Bandeira.
  In this work, we resolve these conjectures and show that spectral algorithms based on the Kikuchi hierarchy \cite{WAM19} succeed whenever $\lambda \geq \Theta_r(1) \cdot n^{-r/4} \cdot \ell^{1/2-r/4}$ where $\Theta_r(1)$ only hides an absolute constant independent of $n$ and $\ell$. A sharp bound such as this was previously known only for $\ell \leq 3r/4$ via non-asymptotic techniques in random matrix theory inspired by free probability.</description>

      <title>Simple Quantum Algorithm for Approximate $k$-Mismatch Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the $k$-mismatch problem, given a pattern and a text of length $n$ and $m$ respectively, we have to find if the text has a sub-string with a Hamming distance of at most $k$ from the pattern. This has been studied in the classical setting since 1982 and recently in the quantum computational setting by Jin and Nogler and Kociumaka, Nogler, and Wellnitz. We provide a simple quantum algorithm that solves the problem in an approximate manner, given a parameter $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$. It returns an occurrence as a match only if it is a $\left(1+\epsilon\right)k$-mismatch. If it does not return any occurrence, then there is no $k$-mismatch. This algorithm has a time (size) complexity of $\tilde{O}\left( \epsilon^{-1} \sqrt{\frac{mn}{k}} \right)$.</description>

      <title>Online Learning in the Random Order Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically} equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that, in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general adversarial model.</description>

      <title>A Hardware Accelerator for the Goemans-Williamson Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial problem Max-Cut has become a benchmark in the evaluation of local search heuristics for both quantum and classical optimisers. In contrast to local search, which only provides average-case performance guarantees, the convex semidefinite relaxation of Max-Cut by Goemans and Williamson, provides worst-case guarantees and is therefore suited to both the construction of benchmarks and in applications to performance-critic scenarios.
  We show how extended floating point precision can be incorporated in algebraic subroutines in convex optimisation, namely in indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which are used in Interior Point Methods in the case of very large problem sizes. Also, an estimate is provided of the expected acceleration of the time to solution for a hardware architecture that runs natively on extended precision. Specifically, when using indirect matrix inversion methods like Conjugate Gradient, which have lower complexity than direct methods and are therefore used in very large problems, we see that increasing the internal working precision reduces the time to solution by a factor that increases with the system size.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Almost Stable Clustering with Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of stable (or perturbation-resilient) instances of $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$ and $\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ clustering problems in metrics with small doubling dimension. While these problems have been extensively studied under multiplicative perturbation resilience in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces (e.g., (Friggstad et al., 2019; Cohen-Addad and Schwiegelshohn, 2017)), we adopt a more general notion of stability, termed ``almost stable'', which is closer to the notion of $(\alpha, \varepsilon)$-perturbation resilience introduced by Balcan and Liang (2016). Additionally, we extend our results to $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ with penalties, where each data point is either assigned to a cluster centre or incurs a penalty.
  We show that certain special cases of almost stable $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties) are solvable in polynomial time. To complement this, we also examine the hardness of almost stable instances and $(1 + \frac{1}{poly(n)})$-stable instances of $\mathrm{k-M\small{EANS}}$/$\mathrm{k-M\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties), proving super-polynomial lower bounds on the runtime of any exact algorithm under the widely believed Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).</description>

      <title>Taming Imperfect Process Verifiers: A Sampling Perspective on Backtracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random walk (Sinclair &amp; Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.</description>

      <title>Optimized Degree Realization: Minimum Dominating Set &amp; Maximum Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Degree Realization problem requires, given a sequence $d$ of $n$ positive integers, to decide whether there exists a graph whose degrees correspond to $d$, and to construct such a graph if it exists. A more challenging variant of the problem arises when $d$ has many different realizations, and some of them may be more desirable than others. We study \emph{optimized realization} problems in which the goal is to compute a realization that optimizes some quality measure. Efficient algorithms are known for the problems of finding a realization with the maximum clique, the maximum independent set, or the minimum vertex cover. In this paper, we focus on two problems for which such algorithms were not known. The first is the Degree Realization with Minimum Dominating Set problem, where the goal is to find a realization whose minimum dominating set is minimized among all the realizations of the given sequence $d$. The second is the Degree Realization with Maximum Matching problem, where the goal is to find a realization with the largest matching among all the realizations of $d$. We present polynomial time realization algorithms for these two open problems.
  A related problem of interest and importance is \emph{characterizing} the sequences with a given value of the optimized function. This leads to an efficient computation of the optimized value without providing the realization that achieves that value. For the Maximum Matching problem, a succinct characterization of degree sequences with a maximum matching of a given size was known. This paper provides a succinct characterization of sequences with minimum dominating set of a given size.</description>

      <title>When Location Shapes Choice: Placement Optimization of Substitutable Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strategic product placement can have a strong influence on customer purchase behavior in physical stores as well as online platforms. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of optimizing the placement of substitutable products in designated display locations to maximize the expected revenue of the seller. We model the customer behavior as a two-stage process: first, the customer visits a subset of display locations according to a browsing distribution; second, the customer chooses at most one product from the displayed products at those locations according to a choice model. Our goal is to design a general algorithm that can select and place the products optimally for any browsing distribution and choice model, and we call this the Placement problem. We give a randomized algorithm that utilizes an $\alpha$-approximate algorithm for cardinality constrained assortment optimization and outputs a $\frac{\Theta(\alpha)}{\log m}$-approximate solution (in expectation) for Placement with $m$ display locations, i.e., our algorithm outputs a solution with value at least $\frac{\Omega(\alpha)}{\log m}$ factor of the optimal and this is tight in the worst case. We also give algorithms with stronger guarantees in some special cases. In particular, we give a deterministic $\frac{\Omega(1)}{\log m}$-approximation algorithm for the Markov choice model, and a tight $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for the problem when products have identical prices.</description>

      <title>O(1) Insertion for Random Walk d-ary Cuckoo Hashing up to the Load Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14394v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing algorithm was defined by Fotakis, Pagh, Sanders, and Spirakis to generalize and improve upon the standard cuckoo hashing algorithm of Pagh and Rodler. Random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing has low space overhead, guaranteed fast access, and fast in practice insertion time. In this paper, we give a theoretical insertion time bound for this algorithm. More precisely, for every $d\ge 3$ hashes, let $c_d^*$ be the sharp threshold for the load factor at which a valid assignment of $cm$ objects to a hash table of size $m$ likely exists. We show that for any $d\ge 4$ hashes and load factor $c&lt;c_d^*$, the expectation of the random walk insertion time is $O(1)$, that is, a constant depending only on $d$ and $c$ but not $m$.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum advantages for practical non-Hermitian eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rich field of study, with applications ranging from $PT$-symmetry breaking and skin effects to non-Hermitian topological phase transitions. Yet most studies remain restricted to small-scale or classically tractable systems. While quantum computing has shown strong performance in Hermitian eigenproblems, its extension to the non-Hermitian regime remains largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm to address general non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, specifically targeting eigenvalues near a given line in the complex plane -- thereby generalizing previous results on ground state energy and spectral gap estimation for Hermitian matrices. Our method combines a fuzzy quantum eigenvalue detector with a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently isolate relevant eigenvalues. This yields a provable exponential quantum speedup for non-Hermitian eigenproblems. Furthermore, we discuss the broad applications in detecting spontaneous $PT$-symmetry breaking, estimating Liouvillian gaps, and analyzing classical Markov processes. These results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in tackling challenging problems across quantum physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>phylo2vec: a library for vector-based phylogenetic tree manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetics is a fundamental component of evolutionary analysis frameworks in biology and linguistics. Recently, the advent of large-scale genomics and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the necessity for phylogenetic software to handle large datasets. While significant efforts have focused on scaling optimisation algorithms, visualization, and lineage identification, an emerging body of research has been dedicated to efficient representations of data for genomes and phylogenetic trees. Compared to the traditional Newick format which represents trees using strings of nested parentheses, modern tree representations utilize integer vectors to define the tree topology traversal. This approach offers several advantages, including easier manipulation, increased memory efficiency, and applicability to machine learning.
  Here, we present the latest release of phylo2vec (or Phylo2Vec), a high-performance software package for encoding, manipulating, and analysing binary phylogenetic trees. At its core, the package is based on the phylo2vec representation of binary trees, and is designed to enable fast sampling and tree comparison. This release features a core implementation in Rust for improved performance and memory efficiency, with wrappers in R and Python (superseding the original release), making it accessible to a broad audience in the bioinformatics community.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Weight Parity Factor Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate quantum error correction (QEC) decoding is crucial for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoding, while being near-optimal, is intractable on general quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes and typically relies on approximation and heuristics. We propose HyperBlossom, a unified framework that formulates MLE decoding as a Minimum-Weight Parity Factor (MWPF) problem and generalizes the blossom algorithm to hypergraphs via a similar primal-dual linear programming model with certifiable proximity bounds. HyperBlossom unifies all the existing graph-based decoders like (Hypergraph) Union-Find decoders and Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder, thus bridging the gap between heuristic and certifying decoders.
  We implement HyperBlossom in software, namely Hyperion. Hyperion achieves a 4.8x lower logical error rate compared to the MWPM decoder on the distance-11 surface code and 1.6x lower logical error rate compared to a fine-tuned BPOSD decoder on the $[[90, 8, 10]]$ bivariate bicycle code under code-capacity noise. It also achieves an almost-linear average runtime scaling on both the surface code and the color code, with numerical results up to sufficiently large code distances of 99 and 31 for code-capacity noise and circuit-level noise, respectively.</description>

      <title>Explainable Information Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal signaling schemes in information design (Bayesian persuasion) problems often involve non-explainable randomization or disconnected partitions of state space, which are too intricate to be audited or communicated. We propose explainable information design in the context of information design with a continuous state space, restricting the information designer to use $K$-partitional signaling schemes defined by deterministic and monotone partitions of the state space, where a unique signal is sent for all states in each part. We first prove that the price of explainability (PoE) -- the ratio between the performances of the optimal explainable signaling scheme and unrestricted signaling scheme -- is exactly $1/2$ in the worst case, meaning that partitional signaling schemes are never worse than arbitrary signaling schemes by a factor of 2.
  We then study the complexity of computing optimal explainable signaling schemes. We show that the exact optimization problem is NP-hard in general. But for Lipschitz utility functions, an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal explainable signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time. And for piecewise constant utility functions, we provide an efficient algorithm to find an explainable signaling scheme that provides a $1/2$ approximation to the optimal unrestricted signaling scheme, which matches the worst-case PoE bound.
  A technical tool we develop is a conversion from any optimal signaling scheme (which satisfies a bi-pooling property) to a partitional signaling scheme that achieves $1/2$ fraction of the expected utility of the former. We use this tool in the proofs of both our PoE result and algorithmic result.</description>
