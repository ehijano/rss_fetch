      <title>Normality of monodromy group in generic convolution group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On an abelian variety $A$, sheaf convolution gives a Tannakian formalism for perverse sheaves. Let $X$ be an irreducible algebraic variety with generic point $\eta$. Let $K$ be a family of perverse sheaves (more precisely, a relative perverse sheaf) on the constant abelian scheme $p_X:A\times X\to X$. We show that for uncountably many character sheaves $L_{\chi}$ on $A$, the monodromy groups of $R^0p_{X*}(K\otimes p_A^*L_{\chi})$ are normal in the Tannakian group $G(K|_{A_{\eta}})$ of the perverse sheaf $K|_{A_{\eta}}\in\mathrm{Perv}(A_{\eta})$.
  This result is inspired from and could be compared to two other normality results: In the same setting, the Tannakian group $G(K|_{A_{\bar{\eta}}})$ is normal in $G(K|_{A_{\eta}})$ (due to Lawrence-Sawin). For a polarizable variation of Hodge structures, outside a meager locus, the connected monodromy group is normal in the derived Mumford-Tate group (due to Andr\'e).</description>

      <title>Ceresa Cycles of $X_{0}(N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ceresa cycle is an algebraic 1-cycle on the Jacobian of an algebraic curve. Although it is homologically trivial, Ceresa famously proved that for a very general complex curve of genus at least 3, it is non-trivial in the Chow group. In this paper we study the Ceresa cycle attached to the complete modular curve $X_{0}(N)$. For prime level $p$ we give a complete description, namely we prove that if $X_{0}(p)$ is not hyperelliptic, then its Ceresa cycle is non-torsion. For general level $N$, we prove that there are finitely many $X_{0}(N)$ with torsion Ceresa cycle. Our method relies on the relationship between the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle and Chow-Heegner points on the Jacobian. We use the geometry and arithmetic of modular Jacobians to prove that such points are of infinite order and therefore deduce non-vanishing of the Ceresa cycle.</description>

      <title>A Hodge Theoretic generalization of $\mathbb{Q}$-Homology Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a natural Hodge theoretic generalization of rational (or $\mathbb{Q}$-)homology manifolds through an invariant ${\rm HRH(Z)}$ where $Z$ is a complex algebraic variety. The defining property of this notion encodes the difference between higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities for local complete intersections, which are two classes of singularities that have recently gained much attention.
  We show that ${\rm HRH(Z)}$ can be characterized when the variety $Z$ is embedded into a smooth variety using the local cohomology mixed Hodge modules. Near a point, this is also characterized by the local cohomology of $Z$ at the point, and hence, by the cohomology of the link. We give an application to partial Poincar\'{e} duality.
  In the case of local complete intersection subvarieties, we relate ${\rm HRH(Z)}$ to various invariants. In the hypersurface case it turns out that ${\rm HRH(Z)}$ can be completely characterized by these invariants. However, for higher codimension subvarieties, the behavior is rather subtle, and in this case we relate ${\rm HRH(Z)}$ to these invariants through inequalities and give some conditions on when equality holds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed Weil cohomology with values in an abelian rigid tensor category is a cohomological functor on Voevodsky's category of motives which is satisfying K\"unneth formula and such that its restriction to Chow motives is a Weil cohomology. We show that the universal mixed Weil cohomology exists. Nori motives can be recovered as a universal enrichment of Betti cohomology via a localisation. This new picture is drawing some consequences with respect to the theory of mixed motives in arbitrary characteristic.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for toric GIT quotients via Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal X=[(\mathbb C^r\setminus Z)/G]$ be a toric Fano orbifold. We compute the Fourier transform of the $G$-equivariant quantum cohomology central charge of any $G$-equivariant line bundle on $\mathbb C^r$ with respect to certain choice of parameters. This gives the quantum cohomology central charge of the corresponding line bundle on $\mathcal X$, while in the oscillatory integral expression it becomes the oscillatory integral in the mirror Landau-Ginzburg mirror of $\mathcal X$. Moving these parameters to real numbers simultaneously deforms the integration cycle to the mirror Lagrangian cycle of that line bundle. This computation produces a new proof the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for $\mathcal X$.</description>

      <title>Linear weighted bounded negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a linear version of the weighted bounded negativity conjecture. It considers a smooth projective surface $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and predicts the existence of a common lower bound on $C^2/(D\cdot C)$ for all reduced and irreducible curves $C$ and all big and nef divisors such that $D\cdot C&gt;0$, both on $X$.
  We prove that, in the complex case, there exists such a bound for all nef divisors spanning a ray out an open covering of the limit rays of negative curves. In the same vein, we provide explicit bounds when $X$ is a rational surface.
  Our proofs involve the existence of a foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ but most of our results are independent of $\mathcal{F}$.</description>

      <title>Elliptic curves in game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Spohn curves, the algebro-geometric models of dependency equilibria for $2 \times 2$ normal-form games. These curves arise as the intersection of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^3$ and are generically elliptic curves. We compute and verify the $j$-invariant for elliptic curves arising as the intersection of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$ using two different implementations: by computing the Aronhold invariants and the discriminant (in Mathematica) and using algorithms for the arithmetic of elliptic curves (in-built in Pari/GP). We define an equivalency of generic $2\times 2$ games based on the $j$-invariant of the Spohn curve. Additionally, we examine the reduction of Spohn curves to plane curves and analyze conditions under which they are reducible. Notably, we prove that the real points are dense on the Spohn curve in all cases. Our examples and computations are further supported by Macaulay2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the space of square matrices, we characterize row-generated subspaces, on which the determinant is an irreducible polynomial. As a corollary, we characterize square systems of polynomial equations with indeterminate coefficients, whose discriminant is an irreducible hypersurface. This resolves a conjecture of Esterov, and, in a sequel paper, leads to a complete description of components and codimensions for discriminants of square systems of equations.</description>

      <title>The universal monodromic Arkhipov--Bezrukavnikov equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on the Grothendieck alteration of a reductive group $\mathsf{G}$ with universal monodromic Iwahori--Whittaker sheaves on the enhanced affine flag variety of the Langlands dual group $G$. This extends a similar result for equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on the Springer resolution due to Arkhipov--Bezrukavnikov. We further give a monoidal identification between adjoint equivariant coherent sheaves on the group $\mathsf{G}$ itself and bi-Iwahori--Whittaker sheaves on the loop group of $G$. These results are used in the sequel to this paper to prove the tame local Betti geometric Langlands conjecture of Ben-Zvi--Nadler.
  Our proof of fully faithfulness provides an alternative to the argument of Arkhipov--Bezrukavnikov. Namely, while they localize in unipotent directions, we localize in semi-simple directions, thereby reducing fully faithfulness to an order of vanishing calculation in semi-simple rank one.</description>

Abstract: We prove a monoidal equivalence between spectral and automorphic realizations of the universal affine Hecke category, thereby proving the tamely ramified local Betti geometric Langlands correspondence, as conjectured by Ben-Zvi--Nadler [BZN07, BZN18]. Specializing to the case of unipotent monodromy, this provides another argument for a fundamental theorem of Bezrukavnikov [B16].</description>

      <title>Symplectic log Kodaira dimension $-\infty$, affine-ruledness and unicuspidal rational curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a closed symplectic $4$-manifold $(X,\omega)$, a collection $D$ of embedded symplectic submanifolds satisfying certain normal crossing conditions is called a symplectic divisor. In this paper, we consider the pair $(X,\omega,D)$ with symplectic log Kodaira dimension $-\infty$ in the spirit of Li-Zhang. We introduce the notion of symplectic affine-ruledness, which characterizes the divisor complement $X\setminus D$ as being foliated by symplectic punctured spheres. We establish a symplectic analogue of a theorem by Fujita-Miyanishi-Sugie-Russell in the algebraic settings which describes smooth open algebraic surfaces with $\overline{\kappa}=-\infty$ as containing a Zariski open subset isomorphic to the product between a curve and the affine line. When $X$ is a rational manifold, the foliation is given by certain unicuspidal rational curves of index one with cusp singularities located at the intersection point in $D$. We utilize the correspondence between such singular curves and embedded curves in its normal crossing resolution recently highlighted by McDuff-Siegel, and also a criterion for the existence of embedded curves in the relative settings by McDuff-Opshtein. Another main technical input is Zhang's curve cone theorem for tamed almost complex $4$-manifolds, which is crucial in reducing the complexity of divisors. We also investigate the symplectic deformation properties of divisors and show that such pairs are deformation equivalent to K\"ahler pairs. As a corollary, the restriction of the symplectic structure $\omega$ on an open dense subset in the divisor complement $X\setminus D$ is deformation equivalent to the standard product symplectic structure.</description>

Abstract: We study the period map of configurations of n points on the projective line constructed via a cyclic cover branching along these points. By considering the decomposition of its Hodge structure into eigenspaces, we establish the codimension of the locus where the eigenperiod map is still pure. Furthermore, we show that the period map extends to the divisors of a specific moduli space of weighted stable rational curves, and that this extension satisfies a local Torelli map along its fibers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an integer $n\geq 7$, we investigate the matroid realization space of a specific deformation of the regular $n$-gon along with its lines of symmetry. It turns out that this particular realization space is birational to the elliptic modular surface $\Xi_{1}(n)$ over the modular curve $X_{1}(n)$.
  In this way, we obtain a model of $\Xi_{1}(n)$ defined over the rational numbers. Furthermore, a natural geometric operator acts on these matroid realizations. On the elliptic modular surface, this operator corresponds to the multiplication by $-2$ on the elliptic curves. This provides a new geometric approach to computing multiplication by $-2$ on elliptic curves.</description>

Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbb P^{n+c}$ be a nondegenerate smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ defined by quadratic equations. For such varieties, P. Ionescu and F. Russo proved the Hartshorne conjecture on complete intersections, which states that X is a complete intersection provided that $n\geq 2c+1$. As the extremal case, they also classified $X$ with $n=2c$. In this paper, we classify $X$ with $n=2c-1$.</description>

Abstract: We describe the limits of canonical series along families of curves degenerating to a nodal curve which is general for its topology, in the weak sense that the branches over nodes on each of its components are in general position. We define a fan structure on the space of edge lengths on the dual graph of the limit curve, and construct a projective variety parametrizing the limits, organized in strata associated to the cones of this fan. This extends to all topologies the works by Eisenbud-Harris (Invent. Math. 87: 496-515, 1987) on curves of compact type and Esteves-Medeiros (Invent. Math. 149: 267-338, 2002) on two-component curves.</description>

      <title>Slope Stable Sheaves and Hermitian-Einstein Metrics on Normal Varieties with Big Cohomology Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04910v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of $\alpha$-slope stability of sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big cohomology class. We also define the notion of a $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric for sheaves in terms of a closed positive $(1,1)$-current $T$. The first main theorem establishes the invariance of these notions under bimeromorphic transformations that are compositions of proper bimeromorphic maps and bimeromorphic morphisms isomorphic in codimension 1. The second main theorem proves the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence with respect to the canonical divisor on a projective variety of general type. We also discuss the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for $\alpha$-slope sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big and nef class</description>

      <title>Characteristic-free normalized Nash blowup of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce conditions on cones of normal toric varieties under which the polyhedron defining the normalized Nash blowup does not depend on the characteristic of the base field. As a consequence, we deduce several results on the resolution of singularities properties of normalized Nash blowups. In particular, we recover all known results of the families that can be resolved via normalized Nash blowups in positive characteristic. We also provide new families of toric varieties whose normalized Nash blowup is non-singular in arbitrary characteristic.</description>

      <title>On the $L$-polynomials of curves over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.07370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss, in a non-Archimedean setting, the distribution of the coefficients of $L$-polynomials of curves of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Among other results, this allows us to prove that the $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space spanned by such characteristic polynomials has dimension $g+1$. We also state a conjecture about the Archimedean distribution of the number of rational points of curves over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Solving parameter-dependent semi-algebraic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider systems of polynomial equations and inequalities in $\mathbb{Q}[\boldsymbol{y}][\boldsymbol{x}]$ where $\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ and $\boldsymbol{y} = (y_1, \ldots,y_t)$. The $\boldsymbol{y}$ indeterminates are considered as parameters and we assume that when specialising them generically, the set of common complex solutions, to the obtained equations, is finite. We consider the problem of real root classification for such parameter-dependent problems, i.e. identifying the possible number of real solutions depending on the values of the parameters and computing a description of the regions of the space of parameters over which the number of real roots remains invariant.
  We design an algorithm for solving this problem. The formulas it outputs enjoy a determinantal structure. Under genericity assumptions, we show that its arithmetic complexity is polynomial in both the maximum degree $d$ and the number $s$ of the input inequalities and exponential in $nt+t^2$. The output formulas consist of polynomials of degree bounded by $(2s+n)d^{n+1}$. This is the first algorithm with such a singly exponential complexity. We report on practical experiments showing that a first implementation of this algorithm can tackle examples which were previously out of reach.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Prismatic Higher $(G,\mu)$-Displays over Quasi-Syntomic Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a deformation theorem for prismatic higher $(G,\mu)$-displays over quasi-syntomic rings. As an application, we extend the classification of $p$-divisible groups via prismatic Dieudonn\'e modules to a class of rings properly containing quasi-syntonic rings. Finally, we related the stack of prismatic higher $(G,\mu)$-displays to integral local Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>A motivic spectrum representing hermitian K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish fundamental motivic results about hermitian K-theory without assuming that 2 is invertible on the base scheme. In particular, we prove that both quadratic and symmetric Grothendieck-Witt theory satisfy Nisnevich descent, and that symmetric Grothendieck-Witt theory further satisfies a projective bundle formula, as well as d\'evissage and A^1-invariance over a regular Noetherian base of finite Krull dimension. We use this to show that over a regular Noetherian base, symmetric Grothendieck-Witt theory is represented by a motivic E-infinity-ring spectrum, which we then show is an absolutely pure spectrum, answering a question of D\'eglise. As with algebraic K-theory, we show that over a general base, one can also construct a hermitian K-theory motivic spectrum, representing this time a suitable homotopy invariant and Karoubi-localising version of Grothendieck-Witt theory.</description>
