      <title>Model Evaluation of a Transformable CubeSat for Nonholonomic Attitude Reorientation Using a Drop Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a design for a drop tower test to evaluate a numerical model for a structurally reconfigurable spacecraft with actuatable joints, referred to as a transformable spacecraft. A mock-up robot for a 3U-sized transformable spacecraft is designed to fit in a limited time and space of the microgravity environment available in the drop tower. The robot performs agile reorientation, referred to as nonholonomic attitude control, by actuating joints in a particular manner. To adapt to the very short duration of microgravity in the drop tower test, a successive joint actuation maneuver is optimized to maximize the amount of attitude reorientation within the time constraint. The robot records the angular velocity history of all four bodies, and the data is analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model. We confirm that the constructed numerical model sufficiently replicates the robot's motion and show that the post-experiment model corrections further improve the accuracy of the numerical simulations. Finally, the difference between this drop tower test and the actual orbit demonstration is discussed to show the prospect.</description>

      <title>A Heliocentric-orbiting Objects Processing System (HOPS) for the Wide Field Survey Telescope: Architecture, Processing Workflow, and Preliminary Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-field surveys have markedly enhanced the discovery and study of solar system objects (SSOs). The 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) represents the foremost facility dedicated to optical time-domain surveys in the northern hemisphere. To fully exploit WFST's capabilities for SSO detection, we have developed a heliocentric-orbiting objects processing system (HOPS) tailored for identifying these objects. This system integrates HelioLinC3D, an algorithm well suited for the WFST survey cadence, characterized by revisiting the same sky field twice on the majority of nights. In this paper, we outline the architecture and processing flow of our SSO processing system. The application of the system to the WFST pilot survey data collected between March and May 2024 demonstrates exceptional performance in terms of both temporal efficiency and completeness. A total of 658,489 observations encompassing 38,520 known asteroids have been documented, and 241 newly discovered asteroids have been assigned provisional designations. In particular, 27% of these new discoveries were achieved using merely two observations per night on three nights. The preliminary results not only illuminate the effectiveness of integrating HelioLinC3D within the SSO processing system, but also emphasize the considerable potential contributions of WFST to the field of solar system science.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing parametric gravitational-wave population fits from non-parametric results without refitting the data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining multiple events into population analyses is a cornerstone of gravitational-wave astronomy. A critical component of such studies is the assumed population model, which can range from astrophysically motivated functional forms to non-parametric treatments that are flexible but difficult to interpret. In practice, the current approach is to fit the data multiple times with different population models to identify robust features. We propose an alternative strategy: assuming the data have already been fit with a flexible model, we present a practical recipe to reconstruct the population distribution of a different model. As our procedure postprocesses existing results, it avoids the need to access the underlying gravitational-wave data again and handle selection effects. Additionally, our reconstruction metric provides a goodness-of-fit measure to compare multiple models. We apply this method to the mass distribution of black-hole binaries detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Our work paves the way for streamlined gravitational-wave population analyses by fitting the data once and for all with advanced non-parametric methods and careful handling of selection effects, while the astrophysical interpretation is then made accessible using our reconstruction procedure on targeted models. The key principle is that of conceptually separating data description from data interpretation.</description>

      <title>GECKO Follow-up Observation of the Binary Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger Candidate S230518h</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) event S230518h is a potential binary neutron star-black hole merger (NSBH) event that was detected during engineering run 15 (ER15), which served as the commissioning period before the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O4a observing run. Despite its low probability of producing detectable electromagnetic emissions, we performed extensive follow-up observations of this event using the GECKO telescopes in the southern hemisphere. Our observation covered 61.7\% of the 90\% credible region, a $\rm 284\:deg^2$ area accessible from the southern hemisphere, reaching a median limiting magnitude of $R=21.6$ mag. In these images, we conducted a systematic search for an optical counterpart of this event by combining a CNN-based classifier and human verification. We identified 128 transient candidates, but no significant optical counterpart was found that could have caused the GW signal. Furthermore, we provide feasible KN properties that are consistent with the upper limits of observation. Although no optical counterpart was found, our result demonstrates both GECKO's efficient wide-field follow-up capabilities and usefulness for constraining properties of kilonovae from NSBH mergers at distances of $\sim 200$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>NutMaat: A Python package for stellar spectral classification on the MK system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar spectral classification according to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system remains fundamental to astrophysical studies, yet modern surveys require automated, scalable tools. We present NutMaat, a Python-based package inspired by MKCLASS, designed to automate MK classification while addressing scalability and usability limitations. It employs modern computational tools for batch processing and offers a modular architecture that enables efficient, platform-independent analysis of large spectral datasets. Tested on the CFLIB and MILES libraries, NutMaat achieved spectral and luminosity classification accuracies comparable to MKCLASS, with minimal systematic offsets and a robust performance down to S/N $\approx$ 5. NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on LAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating survey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending wavelength coverage, computational acceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. As an open-source tool, NutMaat bridges traditional MK methods with modern data workflows, offering a scalable solution for current and future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.</description>

      <title>The Light Source of the TRIDENT Pathfinder Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In September 2021, a site scouting mission known as the TRIDENT pathfinder experiment (TRIDENT EXplorer, T-REX for short) was conducted in the South China Sea with the goal of envisaging a next-generation multi-cubic-kilometer neutrino telescope. One of the main tasks is to measure the in-situ optical properties of seawater at depths between $2800~\mathrm{m}$ and $3500~\mathrm{m}$, where the neutrino telescope will be instrumented. To achieve this, we have developed a light emitter module equipped with a clock synchronization system to serve as the light source, which could be operated in pulsing and steady modes. Two light receiver modules housing both photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and cameras are employed to detect the photons emitted by the light source. This paper presents the instrumentation of the light source in T-REX, including its design, calibration, and performance.</description>

      <title>Bioverse: GMT and ELT Direct Imaging and High-Resolution Spectroscopy Assessment $\unicode{x2013}$ Surveying Exo-Earth O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ and Testing the Habitable Zone Oxygen Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biosignature detection in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most significant and ambitious goals for astronomy, astrobiology, and humanity. Molecular oxygen is among the strongest indicators of life on Earth, but it will be extremely difficult to detect via transmission spectroscopy. We used the Bioverse statistical framework to assess the ability to probe Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels on hypothetical nearby habitable zone exo-Earth candidates (EECs) using direct imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Assuming continued improvement in instruments and data processing, our analysis highlights the best-case scenarios. Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels could be probed on up to $\sim$7 and $\sim$19 EECs orbiting bright M dwarfs within 20 pc in a hypothetical 10-year survey on the GMT and ELT, respectively. Four known super-Earth candidates, including Proxima Centauri b, could be probed for O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ within about one week of observations on the ELT and a few months on the GMT. We also assessed the ability of the ELT to test the habitable zone oxygen hypothesis $\unicode{x2013}$ that habitable zone Earth-sized planets are more likely to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ $\unicode{x2013}$ within a 10-year survey using Bioverse. Testing this hypothesis requires either $\sim$1/2 of the EECs to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $\sim$1/3 if $\eta_{\oplus}$ is large. A northern hemisphere large-aperture telescope, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), would expand the target star pool by about 25%, reduce the time to probe biosignatures on individual targets, and provide an additional independent check on potential biosignature detections.</description>

      <title>Optimized sampling of SDSS-IV MaStar spectra for stellar classification using supervised models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning models are increasingly being used for solving the problem of stellar classification of spectroscopic data. However, training such models requires a large number of labelled instances, the collection of which is usually costly in both time and expertise. Active learning algorithms minimize training dataset sizes by keeping only the most informative instances. This paper explores the application of active learning to sampling stellar spectra using data from a highly class-imbalanced dataset. We utilize the MaStar library from the SDSS DR17 along with its associated stellar parameter catalogue. A preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection, scaling, and dimensionality reduction is applied to the data. Using different active learning algorithms, we iteratively query instances, where the model or committee of models exhibits the highest uncertainty or disagreement, respectively. We assess the effectiveness of the sampling techniques by comparing several performance metrics of supervised-learning models trained on the queried samples with randomly-sampled counterparts. Evaluation metrics include specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the curve; in addition to the Matthew's correlation coefficient, which accounts for class imbalance. We apply this procedure to effective temperature, surface gravity, and iron metallicity, separately. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning algorithms in selecting samples that produce performance metrics superior to random sampling and even stratified samples, with fewer training instances. Active learning is recommended for prioritizing instance labelling of astronomical-survey data by experts or crowdsourcing to mitigate the high time cost. Its effectiveness can be further exploited in selection of targets for follow-up observations in automated astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum dynamics as a scalable solution to the exoplanet opacity challenge: A case study of CO$_2$ in hydrogen atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models). Recently, Niraula et al. 2022 pointed out that due primarily to limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors, opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce an end-to-end solution from \textsl{ab initio} calculations to pressure broadening, and use a perturbation framework to identify the need for precision to a level of $\sim$10\%. We focus on the CO$_2$-H$_2$ system as CO$_2$ is a key absorption feature for exoplanet research (primarily in many gas giants) at $\sim$4.3$\mu$m as pressure-broadening parameters required for interpreting such observations remain sparse. We compute elastic and inelastic cross-sections for the collision of {ortho-}H$_2$~with CO$_2$, in the ground vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For scattering energies above $\sim$20~cm$^{-1}$, moderate precision inter-molecular potentials are indistinguishable from high precision ones in cross-sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available measurement within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements.</description>

Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>
