      <title>Generalized FGM dependence: Geometrical representation and convex bounds on sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the one-to-one relationship between generalized FGM copulas and multivariate Bernoulli distributions, we prove that the class of multivariate distributions with generalized FGM copulas is a convex polytope. Therefore, we find sharp bounds in this class for many aggregate risk measures, such as value-at-risk, expected shortfall, and entropic risk measure, by enumerating their values on the extremal points of the convex polytope. This is infeasible in high dimensions. We overcome this limitation by considering the aggregation of identically distributed risks with generalized FGM copula specified by a common parameter $p$. In this case, the analogy with the geometrical structure of the class of Bernoulli distribution allows us to provide sharp analytical bounds for convex risk measures.</description>

      <title>Local wealth condensation for yard-sale models with wealth-dependent biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Chakraborti's yard-sale model of an economy, identical agents engage in pairwise trades, resulting in wealth exchanges that conserve each agent's expected wealth. Doob's martingale convergence theorem immediately implies almost sure wealth condensation, i.e., convergence to a state in which a single agent owns the entire economy. If some pairs of agents are not allowed to trade with each other, the martingale convergence theorem still implies local wealth condensation, i.e., convergence to a state in which some agents are wealthy, while all their trading partners are impoverished. In this note, we propose a new, more elementary proof of this result. Unlike the proof based on the martingale convergence theorem, our argument applies to models with a wealth-acquired advantage, and even to certain models with a poverty-acquired advantage.</description>

      <title>Constrained mean-variance investment-reinsurance under the Cram\'er-Lundberg model with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal mean-variance investment-reinsurance problem for an insurer (she) under a Cram\'er-Lundberg model with random coefficients. At any time, the insurer can purchase reinsurance or acquire new business and invest her surplus in a security market consisting of a risk-free asset and multiple risky assets, subject to a general convex cone investment constraint. We reduce the problem to a constrained stochastic linear-quadratic control problem with jumps whose solution is related to a system of partially coupled stochastic Riccati equations (SREs). Then we devote ourselves to establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the SREs by pure backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) techniques. We achieve this with the help of approximation procedure, comparison theorems for BSDEs with jumps, log transformation and BMO martingales. The efficient investment-reinsurance strategy and efficient mean-variance frontier are explicitly given through the solutions of the SREs, which are shown to be a linear feedback form of the wealth process and a half-line, respectively.</description>

      <title>Robust Functional Data Analysis for Stochastic Evolution Equations in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an asymptotic theory for the jump robust measurement of covariations in the context of stochastic evolution equation in infinite dimensions. Namely, we identify scaling limits for realized covariations of solution processes with the quadratic covariation of the latent random process that drives the evolution equation which is assumed to be a Hilbert space-valued semimartingale. We discuss applications to dynamically consistent and outlier-robust dimension reduction in the spirit of functional principal components and the estimation of infinite-dimensional stochastic volatility models.</description>
