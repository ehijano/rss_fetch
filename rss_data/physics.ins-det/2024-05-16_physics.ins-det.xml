      <title>Neutron and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-ray Discrimination by a Pressurized Helium-4 Based Scintillation Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressurized helium-4 based fast neutron scintillation detector offers an useful alternative to organic liquid-based scintillator due to its relatively low response to the $\gamma$-rays compared to the latter type of scintillator. In the present work, we have investigated the capabilities of a pressurized $^4$He (PHe) detector for the detection of fast neutrons in a mixed radiation field where both the neutrons and the $\gamma$-rays are present. Discrimination between neutrons and $\gamma$-rays is achieved by using fast-slow charge integration method. We have also conducted systematic studies of the attenuation of fast neutrons and $\gamma$-rays by high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These studies are further corroborated by simulation analyses conducted using GEANT4, which show qualitative agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, the simulation provides detailed insights into the interactions of the radiation quanta with the PHe detector. Estimates of the scintillation signal yield are made based on our GEANT4 simulation results by considering the scintillation mechanism in the PHe gas.</description>

      <title>Challenging theories of dark energy with levitated force sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy is one of the most outstanding problems in physical science, and various theories have been proposed. It is therefore essential to directly verify or rule out these theories experimentally. However, despite substantial efforts in astrophysical observations and laboratory experiments, previous tests have not yet acquired enough accuracy to provide decisive conclusions as to the validity of these theories. Here, using a diamagnetically levitated force sensor, we carry out a test on one of the most compelling explanations for dark energy to date, namely the Chameleon theory, an ultra-light scalar field with screening mechanisms, which couples to normal-matter fields and leaves a detectable fifth force. Our results extend previous results by nearly two orders of magnitude to the entire physical plausible parameter space of cosmologically viable chameleon models. We find no evidence for such a fifth force. Our results decisively rule out the basic chameleon model as a candidate for dark energy. Our work, thus, demonstrates the robustness of laboratory experiments in unveiling the nature of dark energy in the future. The methodology developed here can be further applied to study a broad range of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Performance testing of a novel short axis photomultiplier tube for the HUNT project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with large-area cathodes are increasingly being used in cosmic-ray experiments to enhance detection efficiency. The optical modules (OMs) of the High-Energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) have employed a brand new N6205 20-inch microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) developed by the North Night Vision Science &amp; Technology (Nanjing) Research Institute Co. Ltd. (NNVT). In order to make the 20-inch PMT fit into the 23-inch diameter pressure-resistant glass sphere, NNVT improved the internal structure of PMT and shortened the height of PMT by more than 10~cm. The first batch of these PMTs has been delivered for preliminary research work. This paper describes a specific PMT testing platform built for the first batch of 15 MCP-PMTs, and some performance parameters of PMT, such as P/V ratio, TTS and nonliniearity, are measured.The measurement results show that the new PMT still has good performance and can meet the requirements of HUNT project.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shape Simulation and Discrimination using Machine-Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An essential metric for the quality of a particle-identification experiment is its statistical power to discriminate between signal and background. Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) is a basic method for this purpose in many nuclear, high-energy and rare-event search experiments where scintillation detectors are used. Conventional techniques exploit the difference between decay-times of the pulses from signal and background events or pulse signals caused by different types of radiation quanta to achieve good discrimination. However, such techniques are efficient only when the total light-emission is sufficient to get a proper pulse profile. This is only possible when adequate amount of energy is deposited from recoil of the electrons or the nuclei of the scintillator materials caused by the incident particle on the detector. But, rare-event search experiments like direct search for dark matter do not always satisfy these conditions. Hence, it becomes imperative to have a method that can deliver a very efficient discrimination in these scenarios. Neural network based machine-learning algorithms have been used for classification problems in many areas of physics especially in high-energy experiments and have given better results compared to conventional techniques. We present the results of our investigations of two network based methods \viz Dense Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network, for pulse shape discrimination and compare the same with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>CaloFlow for CaloChallenge Dataset 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CaloFlow is a new and promising approach to fast calorimeter simulation based on normalizing flows. Applying CaloFlow to the photon and charged pion Geant4 showers of Dataset 1 of the Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge 2022, we show how it can produce high-fidelity samples with a sampling time that is several orders of magnitude faster than Geant4. We demonstrate the fidelity of the samples using calorimeter shower images, histograms of high-level features, and aggregate metrics such as a classifier trained to distinguish CaloFlow from Geant4 samples.</description>

      <title>Calorimeter shower superresolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calorimeter shower simulation is a major bottleneck in the Large Hadron Collider computational pipeline. There have been recent efforts to employ deep-generative surrogate models to overcome this challenge. However, many of best performing models have training and generation times that do not scale well to high-dimensional calorimeter showers. In this work, we introduce SuperCalo, a flow-based superresolution model, and demonstrate that high-dimensional fine-grained calorimeter showers can be quickly upsampled from coarse-grained showers. This novel approach presents a way to reduce computational cost, memory requirements and generation time associated with fast calorimeter simulation models. Additionally, we show that the showers upsampled by SuperCalo possess a high degree of variation. This allows a large number of high-dimensional calorimeter showers to be upsampled from much fewer coarse showers with high-fidelity, which results in additional reduction in generation time.</description>

      <title>Study of a cubic cavity resonator for gravitational waves detection in the microwave frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of frequencies above MHz has recently received considerable attention. In this work we present a precise study of the reach of a cubic cavity resonator to GWs in the microwave range, using for the first time tools allowing to perform realistic simulations. Concretely, the BI-RME 3D method, which allows us to obtain not only the detected power but also the detected voltage (magnitude and phase), is used here. After analyzing three cubic cavities for different frequencies and working simultaneously with three different degenerate modes at each cavity, we conclude that the sensitivity of the experiment is strongly dependent on the polarization and incidence angle of the GW. The presented experiment can reach sensitivities up to $ 1 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 100\, MHz, $ 2 \cdot 10^{-20}$ at 1\, GHz, and $ 6 \cdot 10^{-19}$ at 10\, GHz for optimal angles and polarizations, and where in all cases we assumed an integration time of $\Delta t = 1$ ms. These results provide a strong case for further developing the use of cavities to detect GWs. Moreover, the possibility of analyzing the detected voltage (magnitude and phase) opens a new interferometric detection scheme based on the combination of the detected signals from multiple cavities.</description>
