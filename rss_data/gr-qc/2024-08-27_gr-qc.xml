      <title>Inflation and Dark Matter from The Low Entropy Hypothesis and Modeling Mechanism of Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesis of low entropy in the initial state of the universe usually explains the observed entropy increase is in only one time direction: the thermodynamic arrow of time. The Hamiltonian formalism is commonly used in the context of general relativity. The set of Lagrange multipliers are introduced in the formalism, and they are corresponding to the Hamiltonian constraints which are written in terms of "weak equality" - the equality is satisfied if the constraints hold. Follow the low-entropy hypothesis, we postulate a modeling mechanism - a weak equality (of modeling) that holds only on the subspace of the theory space of physical models defined by some modeling constraints. By applying the modeling mechanism, we obtain a specific model of modified gravity under specific modeling conditions. We derive a novel equation of modeling from the mechanism, that describes how different gravitational models emerge. The solution of the modeling equation naturally turns out to be the model of $R^2$-gravity (with additional terms) if ordinary matter is negligible. We also found that this mechanism leads to two models: large-field inflation and wave-like dark matter. Interestingly, the wave-like dark matter model is supported by the most recent observations of Einstein rings.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis and cosmography of a two-fluid cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) space-time, we investigate a two-fluid cosmological model where a tachyon scalar field with self-interacting potential and a modified chaplygin gas with non-linear equation of state are taken as the background fluids. We perform phase space analysis of the autonomous system obtained from the cosmological governing equations by a suitable transformation of variables. Linear stability theory is employed to characterise the stability criteria for hyperbolic critical points. Numerical investigation is carried out for non-hyperbolic points. Our study reveals that modified chaplygin fluid dominated solutions cannot provide the late-time evolution. Late-time accelerated evolution is obtained only when the solution is dominated by tachyon fluid. This study also yields a late-time scaling attractor providing similar order of energy densities in its evolution. The adiabatic sound speed is evaluated for both the fluids and test the stability of the models independently. Further, we perform cosmographic analysis in the model independent way by evaluating all the cosmographic parameters and then $Om$ diagnostic is also found to compare our model with $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel Geometry with Spherical Symmetry: The diagonal and proper frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the proper co-frame and its corresponding (diagonal) co-frame/spin connection pair for spherically symmetric geometries which can be used as an initial ansatz in any theory of teleparallel gravity. The Lorentz transformation facilitating the move from one co-frame to the other is also presented in factored form. The factored form also illustrates the nature of the two degrees of freedom found in the spin connection. The choice of coordinates in restricting the number of arbitrary functions is also presented. Beginning with a thorough presentation of teleparallel gravity using the metric affine gauge theory approach and concentrating on f(T) teleparallel gravity, we express the field equations in the diagonal co-frame. We argue that the choice of diagonal co-frame may be more advantageous over the proper co-frame choice. Finally, assuming one additional symmetry, we restrict ourselves to the Kantowski-Sachs tele-parallel geometries, and determine some solutions.</description>

      <title>A physically modelled selection function for compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3 run and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the observation of nearly 100 compact binary coalescence (CBC) events up to the end of the Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors' third observing run (O3), there remain fundamental open questions regarding their astrophysical formation mechanisms and environments. Population analysis should yield insights into these questions, but requires careful control of uncertainties and biases. GW observations have a strong selection bias: this is due first to the dependence of the signal amplitude on the source's (intrinsic and extrinsic) parameters, and second to the complicated nature of detector noise and of current detection methods. In this work, we introduce a new physically-motivated model of the sensitivity of GW searches for CBC events, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of population reconstructions. In contrast to current methods which rely on re-weighting simulated signals (injections) via importance sampling, we model the probability of detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers as a smooth, analytic function of source masses, orbit-aligned spins, and distance, fitted to accurately match injection results. The estimate can thus be used for population models whose signal distribution over parameter space differs significantly from the injection distribution. Our method has already been used in population studies such as reconstructing the BBH merger rate dependence on redshift.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Gravitational Wave Equations in Spherical Symmetry from Curvature Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole perturbation theory on spherically symmetric backgrounds has been instrumental in establishing various aspects about the gravitational dynamics close to black holes, and continues to be an interesting avenue to confront current challenges in gravitational physics. In this paper, we present an approach to perturbation theory in spherical symmetry that addresses simultaneously some conceivably inconvenient aspects of the traditional methods. In particular, focusing on Schwarzschild's background we are able to derive a decoupled wave equation, for a single complex variable, by simply computing one component of the curvature wave equation satisfied by a complex self-dual version of the Riemann tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the variable consist only of even and odd pieces of the metric fluctuation, respectively, and both satisfy the Regge-Wheeler equation. Besides providing a systematic derivation of decoupled equations, an immediate corollary of our results is the isospectrality between even and odd sectors. We conclude by discussing potential extensions of our formalism to include matter and higher orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a black hole with scalar field in cosmology background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data from elliptical galaxies indicate that the growth in the masses of black holes exceeds what is expected from the accretion of surrounding matter, and this growth appears to be dependent on the expansion of the universe. This phenomenon can be explained by considering the accretion of dark energy, which is responsible for cosmological expansion, into these black holes. In this paper, we investigate the perturbative interaction of a black hole with a real scalar field $\phi$ (which can represent dark energy) in a cosmological background using an appropriate metric. We derive solutions for the field $\phi(t, r)$, the black hole mass $M(t)$, and the expansion rate $H(t)$, and discuss the behaviour of the scalar field $\phi$ in the vicinity of the black hole, with respect to exterior and interior observers. We obtain the energy density of $\phi$ inside of the black hole and find that energy density converges and tends to take a non-vanishing fixed values (stable) at late time of cosmological expansion. We find that on horizon surfaces, it is possible to make the field $\phi$ continuous and bounded (maybe differentiable) function.</description>

      <title>Matter really does matter, or Why $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ type theories are significant for gravitational physics and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Lacombe, Mukohyama, and Seitz, JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024)), the authors provided an in-depth analysis of a class of modified gravity theories, generally called $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, which assume the existence of a non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter. It was argued that if the matter sector consists of Standard Model particles, then these theories suffer from the presence of ghosts, or are just scalar/vector-tensor theories. Hence, the relevance of these theories for cosmology was questioned. It is the goal of the present work to carefully analyze, discuss, and assess the line of arguments proposed in Lacombe et al. JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024). After a qualitative critical discussion of the five general arguments proposed for the validity of a gravitational theory, we present the theoretical foundations of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, including their possible relations with quantum gravity, and discuss in detail the role of matter. The matter source discussed in Lacombe et al., consisting predominantly of a massless scalar field, is extremely restrictive, and rather irrelevant for cosmology and the description of the observational data. We also devote a detailed discussion of the problem of the energy scales of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories. To test the observational relevance of this type of theories we present the comparison of a simple theoretical model with a small set of observational data and with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We conclude by pointing out that the analysis of Lacombe et al., JCAP {\bf 2024}, 05, 064 (2024), even very useful for the understanding of some limited aspects of the $f(R,{\rm Matter})$ theories, and of their theoretical foundations, cannot be considered as a valid or definite criticism of these approaches to gravity.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian formulation of the Tsallis entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational origin of the Tsallis entropy, characterized by the nonadditive index $\delta$. Utilizing Wald's formalism within the framework of $f(R)$ modified theories of gravity, we evaluate the entropy on the black hole horizon for constant curvature solutions to the spherically symmetric vacuum field equations. In so doing, we demonstrate that the Tsallis entropy can be effectively derived from a generalization of the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}\propto R^{1+\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon=\delta-1$ quantifies small deviations from general relativity. In conclusion, we examine the physical implications of our findings in light of cosmological observations and elaborate on the possibility of solving the thermodynamic instability of Schwarzschild black holes.</description>

      <title>g$\delta N$ formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism has been the major computational tool to study the superhorizon evolution of the scalar type perturbation sourced by scalar fields. Recently, this formalism was generalized to compute an arbitrary scalar, vector, and tensor type perturbations, including the gravitational waves (GWs), sourced by an arbitrary bosonic fields. In this paper, we explain how to use the generalized $\delta N$ formalism (the g$\delta N$ formalism), considering a model with U(1) gauge fields as a concrete example. Several new findings on this model and prospects on future gravitational wave experiments are also discussed, including the condition for the two linear polarizations of GWs to have different amplitudes. This paper provides a detailed explanation of our previous paper published in Physical Review Letters. We also discuss the Weinberg's adiabatic mode for an anisotropic background, showing a qualitative difference from the one for the FLRW background.</description>

      <title>Resolving FLRW Cosmology Through Effective Equations of State in $f(T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the cosmological scenario of the universe in the context of the $f(T)$ power law model, where $T$ represent the torsion scalar. To obtain the deterministic solution of the field equations we parametrized the effective Equation-of-State with two parameters $m$ and $k$ as suggested by A. Mukherjee in a flat FLRW environment. We impose constraints on the free parameters of the derived solution by utilizing MCMC analysis assuming the $CC, Pantheon+SH0ES$, and $CC+Pantheon+SH0ES$ as data samples. We explore the dynamics of cosmological parameters. The evolutionary profile of the deceleration parameter exhibits the transition %from the decelerated to the accelerated phase. The effective Equation-of-State parameter indicates the model remains in the quintessence era and gradually becomes the Einsteins-de-Sitter model. In addition to this, we also explore the jerk, snap, and lerk parameters. Furthermore, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows that the model has a consistent positive slope across the entire evolution, but resembles the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future. At last, we conclude that the power law function of the modified $f(T)$ gravity model in the framework of the FLRW universe aligns more closely with the $\Lambda$CDM model for given observational data.</description>

      <title>Can BBH Merger GW Data Constrain Corrections to Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine possible additive corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy of black holes due to classical and quantal modifications of general relativity. In general, black hole entropy is subject to the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics. For the case of binary black hole coalescence, the difference in corrections to the inspiral and remnant black hole entropies is shown, within this law, to be bounded by the difference in the corresponding BH entropies. This latter difference has been measured by several groups attempting to validate Hawking's Area Theorem on black hole horizons, by analyzing gravitational wave data from possible binary black hole mergers. The former difference - that between corrections to remnant and inspiral black hole entropies beyond the BH entropy, is thus constrained by a bound measured from observational data. We examine the implications of the bound for (a) the Wald entropy function for higher derivative corrections to general relativity in an Effective Field Theory scenario, (b) the corrections to the BH entropy due to quantum matter field theory effects, within a Gibbons-Hawking Euclidean quantum gravity scenario and (c) the corrections to the BH entropy within a background-independent Loop Quantum Gravity framework. If calculated entropy corrections follow the essential pattern of BH entropies dictated by the Hawking Area Theorem, consistency with the observational bound is shown to be guaranteed. If they do not, these corrections are then nontrivially constrained by the observational bound.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence. This proposes that the radiated energy of the GW is proportional to the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, with detection reports revealing the approximate scaling of $E_{\mathrm{GW}}\approx\mathcal{M}/10$. While this scaling is evident in numerical relativity, there lacks an analytical expression supporting the relation. This study utilizes a heuristic application of relativistic kinetic theory and massless Bose-Einstein statistics of an entropic graviton gas to GW formation throughout binary coalescence. This approach to GW formation obtains an expression of an effective thermal energy as the radiated GW energy, which extracts the nearly one-tenth scaling of the chirp mass, namely at the chirp phase. Furthermore, it agrees well with the detected energies with 1:1 ratio values ranging from 0.932 for GW150914 to 0.998 for one of three waveform models of GW190521, with 0.851 as an outlier for GW170104. Utilization of a quantum-classical correspondence enabled discussions regarding the usage of equilibrium noise analysis on the graviton gas and kinetic characteristics of the graviton gas during and after coalescence. The latter topic includes, but is not limited to, GW/graviton wave-particle duality, a calculation of the high-energy graviton-graviton total cross section as 1.16% of the chirp mass surface area $A=16\pi G^2\mathcal{M}^2$, and humoring the thought experiment of black hole gravitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, it was shown that Kerr-Sen black holes can be overcharged or overspun into naked singularities neglecting backreaction effects. Here, we re-evaluate the overspinning and overcharging problems incorporating the self energy of the perturbations due to the induced increase in the angular velocity and the electrostatic potential of the event horizon described in a seminal work by Will. We show that Kerr-Sen black holes cannot be overspun or overcharged by perturbations satisfying the null energy condition in a complete second order analysis which comprises the self-energy of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation in a charged, cosmological black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effective temperature, as a rate of gravitational redshift, of the Hawking modes perceived by a radially free falling observer at an arbitrary location in a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(Anti-)de Sitter (RN(A)dS) spacetime. Observers of both positive and negative specific energies have been taken into account. Particular emphasis is on the behaviour of the modes at the inner horizon, and therein on the validity of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture across the physically permissible parameter space of the RNdS metric. Lastly, the behavior of the adiabatic control function has been analysed over the position space of the observer to determine the regimes where the effective temperature function yields a Planckian spectrum of thermal radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of massive scalar perturbations in Kerr black holes using the isomonodromic method. For arbitrary scalar masses $M \mu$ and black hole spins $a/M$, we numerically determine the quasinormal frequencies for various orbital $\ell$, azimuthal $m$, and overtone $n$ numbers. In particular, we derive an analytic expression for frequencies of the zero-damping modes near the extremal limit $a/M \rightarrow 1$. For $\ell=m=1$, we reveal that the fundamental mode becomes a damped mode (rather than a zero-damping mode) if the scalar field is sufficiently heavy. By exploring the parameter space, we find numerical evidence for level-crossing between the longest-living mode and the first overtone at an exceptional point $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$.</description>

      <title>Slowly moving black holes in Lorentz-violating scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scalar field with a timelike gradient defines a preferred slicing. This occurs even in a non-cosmological setup in scalar-tensor theories such as khronometric theory. We study a black hole moving slowly relative to the preferred slicing defined by the scalar field. We consider a family of higher-order scalar-tensor theories that extend khronometric theory. The action is characterized by one constant parameter and one arbitrary function of the kinetic term of the scalar field. A slowly moving black hole is described by a dipole perturbation of a black hole at rest. We treat the metric and scalar-field perturbations consistently, derive a single master equation for the coupled system, and reconstruct the metric for a slowly moving black hole from the master variable. In this way, we revisit and generalize the previous studies. For generic theories in the family we consider, we find a solution that is regular outside the universal horizon and agnostic to the arbitrary function in the action.</description>

      <title>Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a review of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) -- more specifically, $f(R,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar and $T_{\mu\nu}$ denotes the energy-momentum tensor. The inclusion of quadratic contributions from the energy-momentum components has intriguing cosmological implications, particularly during the Universe's early epochs. These effects dominate under high-energy conditions, enabling EMSG to potentially address unresolved issues in General Relativity (GR), such as the initial singularity and aspects of big-bang nucleosynthesis in certain models. The theory's explicit non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry leads to the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, which prompts the investigation of cosmological scenarios through the framework of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems. By employing this formalism, we interpret the energy-balance equations within EMSG from a thermodynamic perspective, viewing them as descriptions of irreversible matter creation processes. Since EMSG converges to GR in a vacuum and differences emerge only in the presence of an energy-momentum distribution, these distinctions become significant in high-curvature regions. Therefore, deviations from GR are expected to be pronounced in the dense cores of compact objects. This review delves into these facets of EMSG, highlighting its potential to shed light on some of the fundamental questions in modern cosmology and gravitational theory.</description>

      <title>Parametrized tests of general relativity using eccentric compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical population simulations predict that a subset of dynamically formed binary black holes (BBHs) may possess eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.1$ at a gravitational wave (GW) frequency of $10 \,\text{Hz}$. Presently, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration tests general relativity (GR) assuming that the binary eccentricity has decayed well before it enters the detector's frequency band. Previous works have shown that binary eccentricity can bias GR tests if unaccounted for. Here we develop two methods to extend parametrized tests of GR to eccentric binaries. The first method extends the standard null parametrized test for quasicircular binaries by adding fractional deviations at each post-Newtonian (PN) order in the eccentric part of the GW phasing (assuming the small-eccentricity limit). Simultaneous measurement of the circular and eccentric deviation parameters ($\delta\hat{\varphi}, \delta\hat{\varphi}^e$) allows us to constrain deviations from GR for eccentric binaries. While strong constraints on the deviation parameters are not achievable with LIGO's projected sensitivity, the multibanding of LISA and CE observations can constrain these deviations to $|\delta\hat{\varphi}_2| \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-3}$ and $|\delta\hat{\varphi}^e_2|\lesssim 2\times 10^{-2}$. The second method looks for GR deviations in the rate of periastron advance ($\Delta\alpha$). The parameter $\Delta\alpha$ ($\Delta\alpha^{\rm GR} \to 0$) can be constrained with LIGO to $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 4 \times 10^{-2}$ (with $1 \sigma$ confidence). Multiband sources observed by LISA and CE provide an improved constraint of $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 3\times 10^{-5}$. The space-based detector DECIGO provides the best constraint on $\Delta\alpha$ with $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 8 \times 10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Dynamics of Spinning Black Hole Binaries in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the post-Newtonian dynamics of spinning black hole (BH) binaries in Einstein-ScalarGauss-Bonnet (ESGB) gravity, a theory that modifies general relativity by introducing a massless scalar field coupled nonminimally to gravity via the Gauss-Bonnet term. By employing an effective field theory (EFT) approach, we extend the Routhian formalism to incorporate spin effects in scalar interactions. In this formalism, we derive for the first time the effective two-body potential for spinning BHs up to the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order in generic ESGB gravity theories. This potential is expressed in terms of the sensitivities of the BHs, which are then obtained through a matching procedure using analytic BH solutions derived here within a slow-rotation approximation, accurate to seventh order in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and fifth order in the BH spin. We also examine the thermodynamic properties of these rotating solutions, which, as shown in previous work, yield important insights into the inspiral phase evolution in ESGB gravity.</description>

      <title>The Flea on the Elephant: tidal Love numbers in subsolar primordial black hole searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting subsolar objects in black hole binary mergers is considered a smoking gun signature of primordial black holes. Their supposedly vanishing tidal Love number is generically thought to help distinguish them from other subsolar and more deformable compact objects, such as neutron stars. We show that a large and detectable Love number of primordial black holes can be generated in the presence of even small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing their discovery. However, such small perturbations are not tightly bound and are therefore disrupted before the mergers. We show that they leave a characteristic signature in the gravitational waveform that could be observed with current and future gravitational wave detectors. Thus, they may still hint towards the primordial nature of the black holes in the merger. Finally, we demonstrate that disregarding possible environmental effects in the matched-filter search for subsolar gravitational wave events can lead to a decreased sensitivity in the detectors.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Signature of Kerr-MOG Black Hole and Superspinar via Lense-Thirring Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the geometrical differences between the black hole~(BH) and naked singularity~(NS) or superspinar via Lense-Thirring~(LT) precession in spinning modified-gravity~(MOG). For BH case, we show that the LT precession frequency~($\Omega_{LT}$) along the pole is proportional to the angular-momentum~($J$) parameter or spin parameter~($a$) and is inversely proportional to the cubic value of radial distance parameter, and also governed by Eq.(1). Along the equatorial plane it is governed by Eq.(2). While for superspinar, we show that the LT precession frequency is inversely proportional to the cubic value of the spin parameter and it decreases with distance by MOG parameter as derived in Eq.(3) at the pole and in the limit $a&gt;&gt;r$ (where $\alpha$ is MOG parameter). For $\theta\neq\frac{\pi}{2}$ and in the superspinar limit, the spin frequency varies as $\Omega_{LT}\propto \frac{1}{a^3\cos^4\theta}$ and by Eq.(38)</description>

      <title>Dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole built by gluing two Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m geometries is presented. The charge on the shell is linearly related to the matter content. For the dynamical stability, a concise inequality is obtained, valid for any barotropic equation of state that relates the pressure with the energy density at the throat. A thermodynamical description of the system is introduced, which leads to the temperature and the electric potentials. Adopting a linear equation of state for the pressure and a definite form for the entropy function, the set of equilibrium configurations that are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits for realising quantum processes in spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interface between quantum and relativistic theories is crucial for fundamental and practical advances, especially given that key physical concepts such as causality take different forms in these theories. Bell's no-go theorem reveals limits on classical processes, arising from relativistic causality principles. Considering whether similar fundamental limits exist on quantum processes, we derive no-go theorems for quantum experiments realisable in classical background spacetimes. We account for general processes allowed by quantum theory, including those with indefinite causal order (ICO), which have also been the subject of recent experiments. Our first theorem implies that realisations of ICO processes that do not violate relativistic causality must involve the non-localization of systems in spacetime. The second theorem shows that for any such realisation of an ICO process, there exists a more fine-grained description in terms of a definite and acyclic causal order process. This enables a general reconciliation of quantum and relativistic notions of causality and, in particular, applies to experimental realisations of the quantum switch, a prominent ICO process. By showing what is impossible to achieve in classical spacetimes, these no-go results also offer insights into how causality and information processing may differ in future quantum experiments in relativistic regimes beyond classical spacetimes.</description>

      <title>High-redshift cosmography with a possible cosmic distance duality relation violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) defines a fundamental link in modern cosmology between geometric distance measurements and redshift. Any observed deviations from the CDDR could suggest the need for new physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this study, we model geometric distances (both luminosity and angular) using a cosmographic expansion with the Pade method, which stabilizes the behavior of the cosmographic series at high redshifts. This approach allows us to determine geometric distances independently of any specific model. By incorporating updated data from supernovae (SN), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic chronometers (CC), we obtain observational constraints for parametric models that quantify the CDDR, alongside all baseline cosmographic parameters. We find that potential CDDR violations introduce new statistical correlations in the cosmographic parameters ($H_0$, $q_0$, and $j_0$). However, within this framework, we do not observe significant deviations from the CDDR, and our results remain consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work offers a novel and straightforward method for testing the CDDR by fixing background evolution through cosmographic techniques, thereby paving the way for new geometric observational tests of possible deviations from standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Implications of Fermionic Dark Matter Interactions on Anisotropic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of Dark matter (DM) within a neutron star (NS) can substantially influence the macroscopic properties. It is commonly assumed that the pressure inside an NS is isotropic, but in reality, pressure is locally anisotropic. This study explores the properties of anisotropic NS with a subfraction of DM (isotropic) trapped inside. Implementing a two-fluid formalism with three Equations of State (EOS): AP3 (a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction model), BSk22 (modeling atomic nuclei and neutron-matter), and MPA1 (considering relativistic effects in nuclear interactions). The properties of NS, such as mass ($M$), radius ($R$), and dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), for various DM-anisotropic configurations, have been rigorously tested against observational constraints. These constraints include data from the binary NS merger GW170817, NICER x-ray measurements, and pulsar mass-radius observations. We observe that with increasing DM subfraction, higher anisotropies could also satisfy the observational constraints. Furthermore, increasing the coupling ($g$) between DM and its mediator leads to the formation of a core-halo structure, with a DM halo surrounding the baryonic matter (BM). Specifically, for coupling values of $g = 10^{-4}$, $10^{-3.7}$, and $10^{-3.5}$, we observe that the maximum radius ($R_{max}$) decreases with increasing anisotropy, which contrasts with the behavior at $g = 10^{-5}$ and in scenarios with no DM. Our analysis indicates that binary pulsar systems could potentially constrain the extent of admixed anisotropic NS or, more optimistically, provide evidence for the existence of DM-admixed anisotropic NS.</description>

      <title>Induced gravitational waves for arbitrary higher orders: vertex rules and loop diagrams in cosmological perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial perturbations serve as crucial probes for studying the early universe, providing a significant window into potential new physics during cosmic evolution. Due to the potentially large amplitudes of primordial perturbations on small scales, the contributions of high-order cosmological perturbations are highly significant. We propose a vertex approach applicable to the study of induced gravitational waves for arbitrary higher orders. Using the vertex approach and tree diagrams, we can directly derive the explicit expressions of higher-order induced gravitational waves without involving the complex and lengthy calculations of higher-order cosmological perturbations. Correlations between different tree diagrams correspond to the loop diagrams of two-point correlation functions of induced gravitational waves. Our investigation reveals that one-particle reducible diagrams impact tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves while leaving scalar induced gravitational waves unaffected.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks</title>

Abstract: The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ Yang-Mills theory is three-dimensional gravity with background sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory with certain gauge groups is known to be equivalent to a first-order formulation of three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant, where both are purely topological. Here, we extend this correspondence to theories with dynamical degrees of freedom. We show that three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ is equivalent to the first-order formulation of three-dimensional Einstein gravity with no cosmological constant coupled to a background stress-energy tensor density (which breaks the diffeomorphism symmetry). The local degree of freedom of three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory corresponds to degenerate "gravitational waves" in which the metric is degenerate and the spin connection is no longer completely determined by the metric. Turning on a cosmological constant produces the third-way (for $\Lambda&lt;0$) or the imaginary third-way (for $\Lambda&gt;0$) gauge theories with a background stress-energy tensor density.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and nuclear-physics implications of a subsolar gravitational-wave event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.</description>

      <title>Towards celestial chiral algebras of self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits. A companion paper will discuss additional details and relations to previously studied self-dual black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optomechanical systems employ increasingly sophisticated quantum-mechanical states of light to probe and manipulate mechanical motion. Squeezed states are now used routinely to enhance the sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers to small external forces, and they are also used in feedback-based trapping and damping experiments on the same interferometers to enhance the achievable cooling of the the phonon occupation number of the differential test mass mode (arXiv:2102.12665). In this latter context, an accurate accounting of the true test mass motion, incorporating all sources of loss, the effect of feedback control, and the influence of classical force and sensing noises, is paramount. We work within the two-photon formalism to provide such an accounting, which extends a physically motivated decomposition of the quantum-mechanical noise of the light field (arxiv:2105.12052). This decomposition provides insight, rooted in experimentally accessible parameters, into the optimal squeezed state that should be employed to achieve the lowest occupation number. We apply this formalism to current and possible future gravitational-wave interferometers, LIGO A+, LIGO Voyager, Cosmic Explorer (CE), and CE Voyager, finding that occupation numbers below 1 are possible over a frequency range comparable to the bandwidth of the trapped and cooled oscillator. We also discuss several technical issues in cooling experiments with gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Violent nonlinear collapse in the interior of charged hairy black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.10932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new one-parameter family indexed by $\epsilon$ of two-ended, spatially-homogeneous black hole interiors solving the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations with a (possibly zero) cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and bifurcating off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(dS/AdS) interior ($\epsilon = 0$). For all small $\epsilon \neq 0$, we prove that, although the black hole is charged, its terminal boundary is an everywhere-spacelike Kasner singularity foliated by spheres of zero radius $r$.
  Moreover, smaller perturbations (i.e. smaller $|\epsilon|$) are more singular than larger one, in the sense that the Hawking mass and the curvature blow up following a power law of the form $r^{-O(\epsilon^{-2})}$ at the singularity $\{r=0\}$. This unusual property originates from a dynamical phenomenon -- violent nonlinear collapse -- caused by the almost formation of a Cauchy horizon to the past of the spacelike singularity $\{r=0\}$. This phenomenon was previously described numerically in the physics literature and referred to as "the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge".
  While we cover all values of $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, the case $\Lambda&lt; 0$ is of particular significance to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our result can also be viewed in general as a first step towards the understanding of the interior of hairy black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unifying quantum theory and gravity remains a fundamental challenge in physics. While most existing literature focuses on the ultraviolet (UV) modifications of quantum theory due to gravity, this work shows that generic infrared (IR) modifications arise when we describe quantum theory in curved spacetime. We explicitly demonstrate that the modifications to the position-momentum algebra are proportional to curvature invariants (such as the Ricci scalar and Kretschmann scalar). Our results, derived through a rigorous application of Dirac's quantization procedure, demonstrate that infrared effects in quantum systems can be axiomatically derived. We study particle dynamics in an arbitrary curved spacetime by embedding them in a higher-dimensional flat geometry. Our approach, which involves embedding particle dynamics in a higher-dimensional flat geometry and utilizing Dirac's quantization procedure, allows us to capture the dynamics of a particle in 4-dimensional curved spacetime through a modified position-momentum algebra. When applied to various spacetimes, this method reveals that the corrections due to the spacetime curvature are universal. We further compare our results with those derived using extended uncertainty principles. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for black holes and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Testing the Speed of Gravity with Black Hole Ringdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the speed of gravitational waves, $c_{GW}$, can be tested by upcoming black hole ringdown observations. We do so in the context of hairy black hole solutions, where the hair is associated with a new scalar degree of freedom, forecasting that LISA and TianQin will be able to constrain deviations of $c_{GW}$ from the speed of light at the ${\cal O}(10^{-4})$ level from a single supermassive black hole merger. We discuss how these constraints depend on the nature of the scalar hair, what different aspects of the underlying physics they are sensitive to in comparison with constraints derived from gravitational wave propagation effects, which observable systems will place the most stringent bounds, and that constraints are expected to improve by up to two orders of magnitude with multiple observations. This is especially interesting for dark energy-related theories, where existing bounds from GW170817 need not apply at lower frequencies and where upcoming bounds from lower-frequency missions will therefore be especially powerful. As such, we also forecast analogous bounds for the intermediate-frequency AEDGE and DECIGO missions. Finally, we discuss and forecast analogous black hole ringdown constraints at higher frequencies (so from LVK, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and in what circumstances they can yield new information on top of existing constraints on $c_{GW}$. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via a companion Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the quantum vacuum in a radiation-dominated and CPT-invariant universe by further imposing the quantum states to be ultraviolet regular i.e., satisfying the Hadamard/adiabatic condition. For scalar fields, this is enforced by constructing the vacuum via the States of Low Energy proposal. For spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fields, we extend this proposal for a FLRW spacetime and apply it for the radiation-dominated and CPT-invariant universe. We focus on minimizing the smeared energy density around the Big Bang and give strong evidence that the resulting states satisfy the Hadamard/adiabatic condition. These states are then self-consistent candidates as effective Big Bang quantum vacuum from the field theory perspective.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate how to use the generalized $\delta N$ formalism, which enables us to compute the evolution of all the large scale fluctuations, including gravitational waves, solely by solving the evolution of the background homogeneous Universe. Using the Noether charge density, we derive an analytic formula which describes the mapping between the fluctuations at the horizon crossing and the sourced gravitational waves at the end of inflation. This formula can apply also to an inflation model with an anisotropic background. Using this formula, we discuss the condition for the non-vanishing linear polarization and the qualitative difference between single- and multi-gauge field models.</description>

      <title>The motion of twisted particles in a stellar gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the motion of a twisted particle possessing intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) as it traverses a weak stellar gravitational field, which we approximate using a polytropic model. We disregard the spin characteristic of the twisted particle, modeling it as a massless complex twisted scalar wave packet to simplify its interaction with gravitational fields. Building on this simplification, we determine the trajectory of this twisted particle by using the center of its energy density and investigate the gravitational birefringence induced by its OAM. In a weak field approximation, we find the gravitational birefringence-OAM relationship parallels that with spin, as described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations. This indicates that the gravitational birefringence induced by OAM can potentially exceed that induced by spin by several orders of magnitude, significantly enhancing its detectability. To broaden our analysis, we introduce a nonminimal coupling term, $\lambda R|\phi|^2$, into the Lagrangian, resulting in the modified expression $\mathcal{L}=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla _\rho\phi\nabla^\rho\phi^*-\frac{1}{2}\lambda R|\phi|^2$. This adjustment is necessitated by the quantization of the scalar field in curved spacetime. We then explore the effects of this term on the motion of the twisted particle. Our findings show that the trajectory of the twisted particle under nonminimal coupling ($\lambda\neq 0$) differs from that in the minimal coupling scenario ($\lambda=0$). Specifically, for a positive nonminimal coupling constant $\lambda$, the trajectory of the twisted particle is expected to deviate away from the stellar center, compared to the minimal coupling scenario.</description>

An energy transfer formula is obtained, $y=Cm_{i}m_{o}/r$, where $y$ is the transferred energy in the collisions of the two wave packets, $m_i$ and $m_o$ are the Misner-Sharp energies for the ingoing and outgoing wave packets, respectively, $r$ is the areal radius and collision place, and $C=1.873$ and $C=1.875$ for the asymptotically flat spacetime and asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime circumstances, respectively. The formula is universal, independent of the initial profiles of the scalar fields.</description>

Abstract: The effect of gravitational particle production of scalar particles on the total effective cosmic energy density (in the era after photon decoupling till the present) is considered. The effect is significant for heavy particles. It is found that gravitational particle production results in an effective increase in the directly measured value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ while it does not affect the value of the Hubble constant in the calculation of the number density of baryons at present time that is used to calculate recombination redshift. This may explain why the Hubble constant determined by local measurements and non-local measurements (such as CMB) are different. This suggests that gravitational particle production may have a non-negligible impact on the $H_0$ tension.</description>

Abstract: In this work, tilted source solutions in both Einstein-Hilbert General Relativity (GR) and Quadratic Gravity (QG) for the anisotropic Bianchi V model are addressed. Since the excellent CMBR match of Starobinsky's inflation with Planck's team measurements data, QG has acquired a prominent status in the effective sense, for sufficiently strong gravity fields. The main interest is in the numeric time evolution to the past towards the singularity and the behavior of the kinematic variables, vorticity, acceleration, and the expansion of this source substance. In QG we found that for universes with higher and smaller matter densities fall into the Kasner or isotropic singularity attractors to the past, respectively. We also found that the Kasner singularity attractor to the past has always zero vorticity, for both GR and QG theories. While for QG the isotropic singularity attractor may have divergent vorticity. For the set of assumptions and conditions supposed in this work, the isotropic singularity attractor, favors QG as compared to GR. Only in QG we were able to find a geometric singularity with divergences in all of the kinematic variables of the substance, decreasing to finite values to the future, upon time reversing. That is, we obtained an initial kinematic singularity substance, that approaches a perfect fluid source.</description>

      <title>Detecting a Gravitational-Wave Background from Inflation with Null Energy Condition Violation: Prospects for Taiji</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The null energy condition (NEC) is a fundamental principle in general relativity, and its violation could leave discernible signatures in gravitational waves (GWs). A violation of the NEC during the primordial era would imprint a blue-tilted spectrum on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nanohertz frequencies, potentially accounting for the recently detected signal by pulsar timing arrays. Remarkably, models of NEC violation during inflation also predict a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the millihertz frequency range, which could be detectable by upcoming space-based GW detectors such as Taiji. The observation of this distinctive spectrum would provide compelling evidence for new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm. In this study, we explore Taiji's ability to detect an SGWB arising from NEC violation during inflation, considering various foregrounds and noise sources, including an extragalactic foreground from binary black hole mergers throughout the universe, a galactic foreground from white dwarf binaries, and the intrinsic noise of the Taiji detector. Employing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques to analyze simulated Taiji data, we demonstrate a remarkable precision improvement of three orders of magnitude compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data set for measuring the tensor power spectrum amplitude, $P_{T,2}$, during the second inflationary stage. This substantial enhancement in measurement capabilities underscores Taiji's potential as a powerful probe for investigating the NEC violation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Charged analog of anisotropic dark energy star in Rastall gravity</title>

Abstract: Dark energy is one of the potential strategies for preventing compact objects from gravitationally collapsing into singularities. Because it is the cause of the accelerated expansion of our universe, it has the greatest impact on the cosmos. Thus, it is plausible that dark energy will interact with any stellar object that is compact in the universe [\textit{Phys. Rev. D} \textbf{103}, 084042 (2021)]. Our main goal in this work is to create a simplified model, in the Rastall gravitational framework, of a charged strange star coupled to anisotropic dark energy in Krori-Barua spacetime [\textit{J. Phys. A, Math. Gen.} \textbf{8}:508, 1975]. Here, we consider a specific strange star object, Her X-1, with observed values of mass $=(0.85 \pm 0.15)M_{\odot}$ and radius $= 8.1_{-0.41}^{+0.41}$ km., so that we can develop our model. In this context, we began by modeling dark energy using the equation of state (EoS), in which the dark energy density is proportional to the isotropic perfect fluid matter-energy density. The Darmois-Israel condition has been used to calculate the unknown constants that are present in the metric. We perform a detailed analysis of the model's physical properties, including the mass-radius relation, pressure, density, metric function, and dark energy parameters, by varying the Rastall coupling parameter. We also examine the stability and force equilibrium of our proposed stellar configuration. Following a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we discovered that our suggested model is both singularity-free and meets all stability requirements needed to be a stable, physically reasonable stellar model.</description>

      <title>Some consequences of the Kerr-Schild gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03289v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Kerr-Schild nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime $\overline{g}_{\m\n}(x)$ are considered. Those are of the form $\overline{g}_{\m\n}+l_\m l_\n$ with $l^2=0$. The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms, one is essentially the Fierz-Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr-Schild family is recovered. Novel examples for more general backgrounds (even including some simple sources) are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from inspiralling compact binaries to N$^3$LO in the Effective Field Theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework to gravitational dynamics, we compute the Hamiltonian, source quadrupole moment, and gravitational-wave energy flux for (non-spinning) inspiralling compact binaries at next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO) in the Post-Newtonian (PN) expansion. We use the recently developed $d$-dimensional multipole-expanded effective theory, and explicitly perform the matching to the (pseudo-) stress-energy tensor. The calculation involves Feynman integrals up to three- (conservative) and two-loop (radiative) orders, evaluated within dimensional regularization. Our (ambiguity-free) results confirm (for the first time) the value of the gravitational-wave flux for quasi-circular orbits at 3PN order, while paving the way forward to the inclusion of spin effects as well as higher order computations.</description>

      <title>Probing the Effective Quantum Gravity via Quasinormal Modes and Shadows of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two quantum-corrected black hole models have recently been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraints approach to quantum gravity, maintaining general covariance \cite{Zhang:2024khj}. We have studied the quasinormal spectra of these black holes using four methods: the higher-order WKB approach with Pad\'e approximants, time-domain integration, Frobenius, and pseudospectral methods. The Frobenius method, in particular, allows us to determine precise values of the frequencies, including the overtones. The two models differ in their choice of quantum parameter $\xi$, and we can distinguish them by their quasinormal spectra. In the first model, increasing the quantum parameter results in higher real oscillation frequencies and damping rates of the fundamental mode. In contrast, the second model shows a decrease in the oscillation frequency of the least-damped mode when the quantum parameter is introduced. We have shown that, while the fundamental mode changes relatively gradually with the quantum parameter, the first few overtones deviate from their Schwarzschild limits at an increasing rate. This results in a qualitatively new behavior: the real parts of the frequencies of the first and higher overtones tend to zero as the quantum parameter increases. In addition to the branch of modes that are perturbative in the quantum parameter, we observe some non-perturbative modes at moderate values of the quantum parameter.
  Additionally, we have calculated the radii of the shadows cast by these black holes and discussed possible constraints based on observations of Sgt $A^*$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chronology Protection Conjecture in The Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC) was first introduced by Hawking after his semi-classical investigation to the behaviour of a spacetime with closed timelike curves (CTCs) in response to scalar perturbation. It is argued that there would be instabilities leading to amplification of the perturbation and finally causing collapse of the region with CTCs. In this work, we investigate the CPC by exactly solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the region inside the inner horizon of the non-extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen~(KS) black hole, where closed timelike curves exist. Successfully find the exact radial solution, we apply the polynomial condition that turns into rule of the energy quantization. The quasinormal modes~(QNMs) of the scalar fields in the region inside the inner horizon of the rotating black hole with nonzero energy have only positive imaginary part describing states that grow in time. The exponentially growing modes will backreact and deform the spacetime region where CTC exists. The CPC is proven to be valid in the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole spacetime. Moreover, since the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole is the most general axisymmetric black hole solution of the string inspired Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, the semiclassical proof in this work is also valid for all simpler rotating black holes of the EMDA theory. The structure of the Dyonic KS spacetime distinctive from the Kerr-Newman counterpart is also explored.</description>

      <title>Evolution of fluctuations in energy at the horizon and in the volume enclosed by it, in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the statistical fluctuations in energy on the Hubble horizon and the Komar energy, which represents the total gravitational energy within the horizon, as the universe expands. Our analysis reveals that these fluctuations generally decrease over time but experience a pronounced spike during the universe's transition into its later accelerated expansion phase. In the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the evolution of these fluctuations shows similar behaviour, eventually stabilising at a constant minimum value. We also find that these fluctuations are holographically connected, provided the universe ends in a de Sitter phase. This holographic connection suggests that in the final de Sitter epoch, the relative fluctuations of the horizon energy and the Komar energy are equivalent, and satisfies, $\sigma_H^2/\left&lt;E_H\right&gt;^2=1/N_{surf}=1/N_{bulk} = \sigma_V^2/\left&lt;E_V\right&gt;^2.$</description>

      <title>Higher-order tails and RG flows due to scattering of gravitational radiation from binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish and develop a novel methodology to treat higher-order non-linear effects of gravitational radiation that is scattered from binary inspirals, which employs modern scattering-amplitudes methods on the effective picture of the binary as a composite particle. We spell out our procedure to study such effects: assembling tree amplitudes via generalized-unitarity methods and employing the closed-time-path formalism to derive the causal effective actions, which encompass the full conservative and dissipative dynamics. We push through to a new state of the art for these higher-order effects, up to the third subleading tail effect, at order G5N and the 5-loop level, which corresponds to the 8.5PN order. We formulate the consequent dissipated energy for these higher-order corrections, and carry out a renormalization analysis, where we uncover new subleading RG flow of the quadrupole coupling. For all higher-order tail effects we find perfect agreement with partial observable results in PN and self-force theories, where available.</description>

      <title>Frame transformation and stable-causal hydrodynamic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a connection has been indicated between the different existing formulations of relativistic hydrodynamic theories, which, in order to be causal and stable, (i) either requires `non-fluid' variables apart from velocity and temperature to be promoted to new degrees of freedom, or, (ii) needs to be in a generalized hydrodynamic frame other than those given by Landau or Eckart. The BDNK stress tensor (originally in a general frame) has been rewritten in the Landau frame using linearized all-order gradient-corrected redefinitions of the temperature and velocity fields. The redefinitions indicate that, while the BDNK formalism has a finite number of derivatives in the general frame, when written in the Landau frame, it either has an infinite number of derivatives, or one has to introduce MIS-like `non-fluid' variables by summing the infinite number of derivatives in the field redefinitions. There can be non-unique ways of performing these infinite-order summations. Finally, the dispersion relations and the corresponding spectra of these different systems of MIS type equations have been analyzed to check that the systems of equations presented here are indeed equivalent to the BDNK formalism, at least in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an expanding $\Lambda$CDM Universe: Decreasing the Local Group mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of dark energy. This work analyzes the evolution of the LG by considering it as a two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full $\Lambda$ cold dark matter $(\Lambda$CDM) background. Using the timing argument (TA), which links LG dynamics to LG mass, we find that the complete $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ lower mass for the LG; while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher mass. The TA mass is modified by (i) simulations and (ii) the effect of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to alleviate the poorly constrained internal mass distributions of M31 and the MW, their time evolution, and the unknown distribution of dark matter between them. First, using IllustrisTNG simulations, we accounted for the effects of two extended halos and their environment (rather than point particles) and predicted their mass $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Second, the LMC effectively changes the separation and velocities of M31 toward the MW and reduces the predicted mass to $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_\odot$. Despite the uncertainties around dark matter between these galaxies, the overall estimated mass is compatible with the mere sum of the MW and M31 masses. The total mass of the TA is compatible with other estimates, such as the Hubble flow and the Virial Theorem with other dwarf galaxies. The combined result shows, for the first time, that a lower mass estimate can be obtained from the TA, with a consistent embedding and other systematic effects, and without an additional dark matter halo around the galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported the observation of the very early TeV afterglow of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, recording the highest photon statistics in the TeV band ever from a gamma-ray burst. We use this unique observation to place stringent constraints on an energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum, a manifestation of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity (QG) theories. Our results show that the 95% confidence level lower limits on the QG energy scales are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1}&gt;10$ times of the Planck energy $E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the linear, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2}&gt;6\times10^{-8}E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the quadratic LIV effects, respectively. Our limits on the quadratic LIV case improve previous best bounds by factors of 5--7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of Cosmic Inflation to explain the latest Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation data is assessed by performing Bayesian model comparison within the landscape of nearly three-hundred models of single-field slow-roll inflation. We present the first Bayesian data analysis based on the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra. In particular, the fourth Hubble-flow function $\epsilon_4$ remains unbounded while the third function verifies, at two-sigma, $\epsilon_{3}\in[-0.4,0.5]$, which is perfectly compatible with the slow-roll predictions for the running of the spectral index. We also observe some residual excess of $B$-modes within the BICEP/Keck data favoring, at a non-statistically significant level, non-vanishing primordial tensor modes: $\log(\epsilon_{1}) &gt; -3.9$, at $68\%$ confidence level. Then, for 283 models of single-field inflation, we compute the Bayesian evidence, the Bayesian dimensionality and the marginalized posteriors of all the models' parameters, including the ones associated with the reheating era. The average information gain on the reheating parameter $R_\mathrm{reh}$ reaches $1.3 \pm 0.18$ bits, which is more than a factor two improvement compared to the first Planck data release. As such, inflationary model predictions cannot meet data accuracy without specifying, or marginalizing over, the reheating kinematics. We also find that more than $40\%$ of the scenarios are now strongly disfavored, which shows that the constraining power of cosmological data is winning against the increase of the number of proposed models. In addition, about $20\%$ of all models have evidences within the most probable region and are all favored according to the Jeffreys' scale of Bayesian evidences.</description>

      <title>Modeling nonlinear scales with COLA: preparing for LSST-Y1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Year 1 results of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide tighter constraints on small-scale cosmology, beyond the validity of linear perturbation theory. This heightens the demand for a computationally affordable prescription that can accurately capture nonlinearities in beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models. The COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method, a cost-effective \textit{N}-body technique, has been proposed as a viable alternative to high-resolution \textit{N}-body simulations for training emulators of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. In this study, we evaluate this approach by employing COLA emulators to conduct a cosmic shear analysis with LSST-Y1 simulated data across three different nonlinear scale cuts. We use the $w$CDM model, for which the \textsc{EuclidEmulator2} (\textsc{ee2}) exists as a benchmark, having been trained with high-resolution \textit{N}-body simulations. We primarily utilize COLA simulations with mass resolution $M_{\rm part}\approx 8 \times 10^{10} ~h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and force resolution $\ell_{\rm force}=0.5 ~h^{-1}$Mpc, though we also test refined settings with $M_{\rm part}\approx 1 \times 10^{10} ~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ and force resolution $\ell_{\rm force}=0.17 ~h^{-1}$Mpc. We find the performance of the COLA emulators is sensitive to the placement of high-resolution \textit{N}-body reference samples inside the prior, which only ensure agreement in their local vicinity. However, the COLA emulators pass stringent criteria in goodness-of-fit and parameter bias throughout the prior, when $\Lambda$CDM predictions of \textsc{ee2} are computed alongside every COLA emulator prediction, suggesting a promising approach for extended models.</description>

      <title>Jetlike structures in low-mass binary neutron star merger remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW170817 and GRB 170817A provided direct evidence that binary neutron star (NSNS) mergers can produce short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, questions remain about the nature of the central engine. Depending on the mass, the remnant from a NSNS merger may promptly collapse to a black hole (BH), form a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) which undergoes a delayed collapse to a BH, a supramassive neutron star (SMNS) with a much longer lifetime, or an indefinitely stable NS. There is strong evidence that a BH with an accretion disk can launch a sGRB-compatible jet via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, but whether a supramassive star can do the same is less clear. We have performed general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the merger of both irrotational and spinning, equal-mass NSNSs constructed from a piecewise polytropic representation of the SLy equation of state, with a range of gravitational masses that yield remnants with mass above and below the supramassive limit. Each NS is endowed with a dipolar magnetic field extending from the interior into the exterior, as in a radio pulsar. We examine cases with different initial binary masses, including a case which produces a HMNS which collapses to a BH, and lower mass binaries that produce SMNS remnants. We find similar jetlike structures for both the SMNS and HMNS remnants that meet our basic critera for an incipient jet. The outflow for the HMNS case is consistent with a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet. There is sufficient evidence that such BZ-powered outflows can break out and produce ulrarelativistic jets so that we can describe the HMNS system as a sGRB progenitor. However, the incipient jets from the SMNS remnants have much more baryon pollution and we see indications of inefficient acceleration and mixing with the surrounding debris. Therefore, we cannot conclude that SMNS outflows are the progenitors of sGRBs.</description>

      <title>Exotic Stable Branches with Efficient TOV Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern inference schemes for the neutron star equation of state (EoS) require large numbers of stellar models constructed with different EoS, and these stellar models must capture all the behavior of stable stars. I introduce termination conditions for sequences of stellar models for cold, non-rotating neutron stars that can identify all stable stellar configurations up to arbitrarily large central pressures along with an efficient algorithm to build accurate interpolators for macroscopic properties. I explore the behavior of stars with both high- and low-central pressures. Interestingly, I find that EoS with monotonically increasing sound-speed can produce multiple stable branches (twin stars) and that large phase transitions at high densities can produce stable branches at nearly any mass scale, including sub-solar masses, while still supporting stars with $M &gt; 2\,M_\odot$. I conclude with some speculation about the astrophysical implications of this behavior.</description>

      <title>Chiral $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ symmetry of 3d conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose mixed boundary conditions for 3d conformal gravity consistent with variational principle in its second-order formalism that admit the chiral $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra as their asymptotic symmetry algebra. This algebra is one of the four chiral $\mathcal W$-algebra extensions of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ and is a generalisation of the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra responsible for soft theorems of graviton MHV amplitudes in ${\mathbb R}^{1,3}$ gravity to the case of non-zero negative cosmological constant. The corresponding charges calculated using the modified covariant phase space formalism are shown to be finite and integrable, and realise this non-linear ${\cal W}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantum field theory of tachyons is unphysical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Paczos et al. (Phys. Rev. D 110, 015006 (2024)) proposed a quantum field theory for free and interacting tachyon fields, which - unlike previous such attempts - is (claimed to be) covariant, have energy spectrum bounded from below, and Lorentz invariant (LI) vacuum. We show that the commutator of the proposed tachyon fields is not LI, and it violates microcausality except for tachyons moving with infinite speed. The proposed Feynman propagator (FP) is based on flawed analogy with QED and actually leads to unitarity violation. The actual FP, the two-point time-ordered correlation function, is neither LI nor a Green's function. Moreover, the potential for an interacting tachyon is shown to be unprotected from quantum corrections that generate tachyon self-interactions, which affects the stability of the tachyonic vacuum. Our analysis indicates that the proposed theory is not covariant, and that the tachyonic vacuum is likely unstable, indicating that superluminal observers are not physical. Therefore, the extended principle of relativity is void and cannot be used to derive nondeterministic description of Nature similar to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of Noether charge and Hilbert action boundary term formulae for the black hole entropy in F($R_{abcd}$) gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By working with the covariant phase space formalism, we have shown that not only can the Hamiltonian conjugate to a Killing vector field $\xi$ be expressed as the sum of the associated Noether charge and $\xi$ contracted with the Hilbert action boundary term for F($R_{abcd}$) gravity, but also be written as its contraction with another $\xi$ independent tensor field. With this, we have proven the equivalence of Noether charge and Hilbert action boundary term formulae for the stationary black hole entropy in F($R_{abcd}$) gravity, which is further substantiated by our explicit computation using both formulae.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of a 2x2 Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance System with Varying Generalized Chaplygin Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of two balance laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer type with varying generalized Chaplygin gas, which exhibits negative pressure and is a product of a function of time and the inverse of a power of the density. The Chaplygin gas is a fluid designed to accommodate measurements for the early universe and late-time universal expansion while obeying the pressure-density-time relation. We produce an explanation and description of the non-self-similar Riemann solutions, including the non-classical singular solutions. We also find that due to a direct dependence on time, a change in the regions allowing for combinations of classical and non-classical singular solutions occurs, therefore a Riemann solution can have different solutions over several time intervals. Our findings are confirmed numerically using the local Lax-Friederichs scheme.</description>

      <title>Excluding Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Based on Solar System Ephemeris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological constraints allow primordial black holes (PBHs) to constitute dark matter in the mass range of $10^{18}$-$10^{22}$g. We show that a major portion of this logarithmic window can be ruled-out based on the Solar System ephemeris, given that the external mass enclosed within 50 au from the Sun did not change by more than $\sim 5\times 10^{-14}$ solar masses per year in recent decades.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is split in two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements sample comprising of 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements sample including 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These 31 measurements are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between the two samples. The distance ladder-based sample yields a best fit $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=0.52$ indicating some correlations. The one-step measurements result in $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=1.43$ indicating some internal tension. If two outlier measurements are removed (TDCOSMO.I-2019 known to have systematics and MCP-2020) the best fit of the one step sample reduces to $H_0 = 68.3 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\chi^2/dof=1.01$, fully self-consistent and consistent with sound horizon based measurements. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.0001 suggesting that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early and late-time measurements, but between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>
