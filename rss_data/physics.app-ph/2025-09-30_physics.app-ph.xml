      <title>A modular framework for collaborative human-AI, multi-modal and multi-beamline synchrotron experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.</description>

      <title>Transmission Loss of a Labyrinthine Acoustic Metamaterial Augmented with Multichannel Feedforward Active Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials and active noise control are two advanced noise control treatments that can typically offer performance that exceeds that of conventional passive noise control treatments. Acoustic metamaterials utilize sub-wavelength structures to realize sound field control, whilst active noise control treatments achieve control via the introduction of additional sources driven to generate a secondary sound field that interferes in a controlled way with the original, primary sound field. This paper presents an investigation into combining these two noise control techniques, to achieve enhanced noise control over a spatial region using a hybrid device. In particular, conventional feedforward active noise control is combined with a labyrinthine metasurface and the increase in performance offered by the hybrid solution is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Combustion Behaviour of Single Silicon Particles in Different Oxidizing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon, despite its abundance and high energy density, remains underexplored as a carbon-free fuel, with limited data available on its combustion characteristics. In this work, the combustion behaviour of silicon particles is examined using an electrostatic levitator with laser ignition. Five oxidizing environments at atmospheric pressure are investigated: air, pure oxygen, and mixtures containing 40% oxygen (by mole) diluted with nitrogen, helium, or argon. The burning droplet peak temperature, measured by three-colour pyrometry, increases by 337 K from air to pure oxygen. The peak temperature of the silicon droplet in the 40%O2-60%He mixture is lower than that in the 40%O2-60%Ar mixture, in contradiction with thermodynamic predictions, due to a higher Lewis number of the helium-diluted mixture. Although oxygen diffusivity is higher in the helium-diluted mixture, a lower burning rate is observed, attributed to the lower combustion temperature. High-speed colour camera observations reveal that the square of the particle diameter decreases with time in each combustion run, following a strong linear relationship (R2 &gt; 0.99) across all oxidizing environments. However, the combustion lifetime is proportional to the initial particle diameter to the power of n, with n ranging from 1.69 to 1.82. This deviation from the expected n = 2 appears to result from unavoidable measurement uncertainties and the limited particle size range, rather than differences in combustion physics. The decrease in silicon droplet size during combustion is attributed to the formation of gaseous SiO as an intermediate combustion product. The SiO species is observed using a UV camera, showing a UV intensity decay from the particle surface. High-speed imaging and LED absorption signals indicate that the final condensed product, SiO2 nanoparticles, are not optically visible, suggesting they possess very low emissivity.</description>

      <title>Modelling spin-wave interference with electromagnetic leakage in micron-scaled spin-wave transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilization of spin-wave transducers for radio-frequency signal processing provides significant potential due to intrinsic tunability, scalability and nonlinearity. However, such components can exhibit passband ripples diminishing their operation and functionality. Here, we experimentally identify the electromagnetic crosstalk (EM) as a major source of passband ripples and provide a simple analytic model to predict the impact on device operation. The results are in good agreement with the experimental observation. In addition, we test multiple transducer geometries to identify operational regimes and minimize the EM impact. Finally, the effect of nonlinear device operation on the passband ripples is addressed, which is of relevance for the exploitation of the spin-waves intrinsic nonlinear traits.</description>

      <title>Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</description>

      <title>Enduring mechanical memory from the constitutive response of elastically recoverable nanostructured materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical memory and computing are gaining significant traction as means to augment traditional electronics for robust and energy efficient performance in extreme environments. However, progress has largely focused on bistable metamaterials, while traditional constitutive memory effects have been largely overlooked, primarily due to the absence of compelling experimental demonstrations in elastically recoverable materials. Here, we report constitutive return point memory (RPM) in elastically recoverable, vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, analogous to magnetic hysteresis-based RPM utilized in hard drives. Unlike viscoelastic fading memory, VACNTs exhibit non-volatile memory arising from rate-independent nanoscale friction. We find that the interplay between RPM and frictional dissipation enables independent tunability of the VACNT dynamic modulus, allowing for both on-demand softening and stiffening. We leverage this property to experimentally demonstrate tunable wave speed in a VACNT array with rigid interlayers, paving the way for novel shock limiters, elastodynamic lensing, and wave-based analog mechanical computing.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum Hall resistance standard from uniform wafer-scale epitaxial graphene on SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report high-precision resistance measurements on quantum Hall resistance devices fabricated from uniform epitaxial graphene grown by propane-hydrogen chemical vapor deposition on a two-inch silicon carbide substrate. Through molecular doping, we achieve a low carrier density regime ($n_\mathrm s &lt; $ 1.5 \textperiodcentered 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$) combined with high mobility ($\upmu \geq$ 6000 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$) at low temperature. Accurate quantization of the Hall resistance is demonstrated at magnetic flux densities as low as 3.5 T, temperatures up to 8 K, and measurement currents up to 325 $\upmu$A, with relative measurement uncertainties of a few parts per billion. A stability diagram mapping dissipation as a function of temperature and current provides insight into optimal doping conditions that maximize the breakdown current. All measurements were carried out in a pulse-tube-based cryomagnetic system, enabling simplified and continuous operation of the quantum Hall resistance standard without liquid helium consumption.</description>

      <title>Correlative 3D Mapping of Structure, Composition, and Valence State Dynamics in Battery Cathodes via Simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding degradation in battery cathodes and other functional materials requires simultaneous knowledge of structural, chemical, and electronic changes in three dimensions (3D). Here, we present a simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS tomography method that enables 3D mapping of atomic structure, composition, valence states, and transition metal inhomogeneity within a single, low-dose STEM tilt series acquisition. Applied to LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) particles at different electrochemical cycling stages, this method reveals nanoscale degradation processes with full spatial correlation. We observe that while chemical composition evolves uniformly throughout the entire primary particle, valence state changes and transition metal segregation are strongly depth-dependent and concentrated near the surface. This coexistence of bulk and surface-driven degradation dynamics reveals distinct mechanisms acting at different spatial scales. The evolution of inhomogeneity and valence states deviates from simple phase transition models, highlighting the roles of ion migration and dissolution-driven segregation. Our findings establish valence state gradients and nanoscale inhomogeneity as active contributors to cathode failure. More broadly, this correlative 3D platform opens new opportunities for studying redox-driven transformations in fields such as neuromorphic computing and heterogeneous catalysis, where composition-structure-function coupling is inherently three-dimensional.</description>

      <title>A Framework to Systematically Study the Nonlinear Fluid-Structure Interaction of Phononic Materials with Aerodynamic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phononic materials (PMs) are periodic media that exhibit novel elastodynamic responses. While PMs have made progress in vibration-mitigation applications, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of PMs to passively and adaptively modulate flow behavior through fluid-structure interaction (FSI). For example, PMs have been shown to delay laminar-to-turbulent transition and mitigate unsteadiness in shock-boundary layer interactions. However, a systematic framework to relate the effect of specific PM behaviors to the FSI dynamics is lacking. Such a framework is essential to systematically investigate the complex and nonlinear coupled dynamics of the FSI. Further, parameters that are not typically considered in PM models become critical, such as the vibration amplitude. This article addresses this gap by proposing FSI-relevant ``behavioral'' parameters, distinct from the structural parameters of the PM, but with a clear mapping provided to them. We use high-fidelity, strongly coupled simulations to quantify the FSI between a novel configuration of laminar flow past a flat plate, equipped with a PM. Our study proposes four critical PM behavioral parameters -- effective stiffness, truncation resonance frequency, a quantity representing the dynamic displacement amplitude, and unit cell mass -- that influence the spectral characteristics of the vortex-shedding process inherent to the flat plate system. Results show connections between each parameter and distinct behavior in the lift coefficient in FSI. While the focus of this work is on the PM-FSI dynamics in an aerodynamic flow, we argue that identifying these behavioral parameters is key to unlocking scientific study and design with phononic materials in fluid flows more broadly.</description>

      <title>Geometric Frustration Directs the Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles with Crystallized Ligand Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer-grafted nanoparticles are versatile building blocks that self-assemble into a rich diversity of mesostructures. Coarse-grained molecular simulations have commonly accompanied experiments by resolving structure formation pathways and predicting phase behavior. Past simulations represented nanoparticles as spheres and the ligands as flexible chains of beads, isotropically tethered to the nanoparticles. Here, we investigate a different minimal coarse-grained model. The model consists of an attractive rod tethered to a repulsive sphere. The motivation of this rod-sphere model is to describe nanospheres with a partially crystallized, stretched polymeric bundle, as well as other complex building blocks such as rigid surfactants and end-tethered nanorods. Varying the ratio of sphere size to rod radius stabilizes self-limited clusters and other mesostructures of reduced dimensionality. The complex phase behavior we observe is a consequence of geometric frustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in silicon (Si) photonics at submicrometer wavelengths are unlocking new opportunities to realize miniaturized, scalable optical systems for biophotonics, quantum information, imaging, spectroscopy, and displays. Addressing this array of applications with a single integrated photonics technology requires the development of high-performance active components compatible with both visible and near-infrared light. Here, we report waveguide-coupled photodetectors monolithically integrated in a foundry-fabricated, short-wavelength, Si photonics platform. We demonstrate two detector variants that collectively cover a continuous wavelength span of $\lambda =$ 400 - 955 nm. The devices exhibited external quantum efficiencies exceeding 60% and 12% over 400 - 748 nm and 749 - 955 nm wavelength ranges, respectively. Measured dark currents were $&lt;$ 2 pA at a 2 V reverse bias. High-speed measurements at $\lambda =$ 785 nm demonstrated optoelectronic bandwidths up to 18 GHz. Avalanche operation was characterized, yielding a gain-bandwidth product of 374 GHz.</description>

      <title>Automated design of compound lenses with discrete-continuous optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g., curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type (e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs achievable by automated lens design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin of the electron has been a key enabler to realize spintronics devices that harness the spin degree of freedom beyond conventional charge-based electronics. In addition to spin, electrons have another degree of freedom associated with the angular momentum: orbital angular momentum. While spintronics has evolved fast and spintronics concepts are now used in magnetic sensors and nonvolatile memories, exploiting orbital angular momentum has just started to be studied. Phenomena mediated by orbital angular momentum have led to a new branch of spintronics called orbitronics. This Perspective discusses how orbitronics can constitute the next step in the evolution of spintronics by reviewing the current understandings and experimental results of orbital effects and summarizing the open questions. Prospects and challenges for devices in particular in non-volatile memory are discussed as an applications perspective.</description>

Abstract: The effect of the selenium concentration in the composition of the $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ semiconductor crystals on their etching with a bromine-methanol solution was studied. A thermodynamic model is proposed to describe the degree of etching of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ and $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals. A thermodynamic law is obtained for the first time to describe the change in the etching rate of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals with different selenium concentrations. Experimental dependencies are constructed for etching trajectories and etching rates with 5% bromine-methanol solutions of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystal samples with nominal $x\sim 0.1$ and selenium concentrations of $y=0$, $y=0.02$, $y=0.06$, and $y=0.1$. The average etching rates were 24${\mu }$m/min, 18${\mu }$m/min, 15${\mu }$m/min, and 13${\mu }$m/min. The threshold effect of a strong decrease in the etching rate upon transition from ternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ to quaternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals, associated with hardening of the crystal structure, is identify and theoretically explained. The obtained experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates and will be useful for choosing the optimal regimes of crystal treatment.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Wireless Multi-Port Sensing by Multiplexed De-Embedding of an Over-the-Air Fixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless multi-port sensing remotely retrieves the scattering matrix of a multi-port device under test (DUT) connected to a set of not-directly-accessible (NDA) antennas that couple over-the-air (OTA) to a set of accessible antennas. If (i) the OTA fixture characteristics are known, and (ii) the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas is sufficient, the OTA fixture can be de-embedded to recover the DUT characteristics. In recent prior work, we solved (i) by connecting the NDA antennas to a specific known tunable load network (TLN). Here, we tackle (ii) by additionally using the TLN to provide measurement diversity. The connection between OTA fixture and TLN constitutes a programmable fixture (PF). When the DUT characteristics cannot be identified based on a single PF realization, we add measurement diversity with multiple PF realizations. The underlying "multiplexed de-embedding" achieves the joint de-embedding of an ensemble of PF realizations when a single PF realization cannot be de-embedded. We experimentally demonstrate our concept by remotely estimating the scattering matrix of a reciprocal, non-unitary 4-port DUT (10 complex-valued unknowns) via a rich-scattering OTA fixture purely based on measurements of a single transmission coefficient between two accessible antennas across 30 different PF realizations. We systematically study the trade-off between the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas and the number of PF realizations. Multiplexed de-embedding of the OTA fixture paves the path to implementing wireless multi-port sensing with low hardware complexity in areas like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic quantum dynamics in a twisted screw spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonrelativistic quantum dynamics of a spinless particle in a screw-type spacetime endowed with two independent twist controls that interpolate between a pure screw dislocation and a homogeneous twist. From the induced spatial metric we build the covariant Schr\"odinger operator, separate variables to obtain a single radial eigenproblem, and include a uniform magnetic field and an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux by minimal coupling. Analytically, we identify a clean separation between a global, AB-like reindexing set by the screw parameter and a local, curvature-driven mixing generated by the distributed twist. We derive the continuity equation and closed expressions for the azimuthal and axial probability currents, establish practical parameter scalings, and recover limiting benchmarks (AB, Landau, and flat space). Numerically, a finite-difference Sturm-Liouville solver (with core excision near the axis and Langer transform) resolves spectra, wave functions, and currents. The results reveal AB periodicity and reindexing with the screw parameter, Landau-fan trends, twist-induced level tilts and avoided crossings, and a geometry-induced near-axis backflow of the axial current with negligible weight in cross-section integrals. The framework maps the geometry and fields directly onto measurable spectral shifts, interferometric phases, and persistent-current signals.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and Synchrotron Validation of $\mu$-XRF for Sulfur Mapping in CTMP Paper Samples</title>

Abstract: The transition toward renewable, fiber-based packaging requires an improved understanding of chemical modifications in high-yield pulps such as chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). Sulfonation uniformity is essential for the energy-efficient production of high-strength CTMP pulp. However, laboratory methods only measure total sulfur and cannot illustrate its distribution at the fiber level, which can be visualized using $\mu$-XRF. In this work, we present a laboratory $\mu$-XRF system developed at Mid Sweden University and assess its capability to detect light elements in CTMP paper handsheets. A 32 $\times$ 32 point grid scan (1.6-1.6 mm$^2$ field of view, 50 $\mu$m step, 300 s/point) successfully resolved sulfur K$\alpha$ (2.31 keV) and calcium K$\alpha$ (3.69 keV) fluorescence without helium flushing. Comparative measurements at the Elettra synchrotron confirmed consistency of sulfur peak position and spatial distribution, with higher spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Histogram analysis using Wasserstein distance metrics demonstrated close agreement between datasets despite differing acquisition conditions. These results demonstrate that laboratory XRF can reproducibly detect and map sulfur in CTMP fibers under ambient conditions, providing a practical tool to complement synchrotron studies and supporting the development of energy-efficient, fiber-based packaging materials.</description>

      <title>Electron volt energy resolution with ptychography using a broadband continuum spectrum</title>

Abstract: Ptychography is a scanning coherent diffraction imaging technique successfully applied in the electron, visible and x-ray regimes. One of the distinct features of ptychography with respect to other coherent diffraction techniques is its capability of dealing with partial spatial and temporal coherence via the reconstruction algorithm. Here we focus on the temporal and clarify theoretically and with simulations the constraints which affect the energy resolution limits of the ptychographic algorithms. Based on this, we design and perform simulations for a broadband ptychography in the hard x-ray regime, which enables an energy resolution down to 1 eV. We benchmark the simulations against experimental ptychographic data from a nickel test sample, by extracting the x-ray absorption near edge spectrum with energy resolution of 5 eV using a continuum spectrum of 20 eV bandwidth. We review the results, discuss the limitations, and provide guidelines for future broadband ptychography experiments, its prospective applications and potential impact on achieving diffraction limited resolutions.</description>

      <title>Thermal diffusivity measurement based on evaporative cryocooling excitation: Theory and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-thermal methods for measuring thermal diffusivity inherently pose an ill-posed inverse problem, affected by factors such as sample thickness, heating or cooling time, and excitation energy. Measurement accuracy becomes particularly challenging under non-impulsive pulsed excitation when the observation timescale is comparable to the pulse duration. This is often due to poorly defined pulse shapes, broadened thermal responses, and the absence of clear boundary conditions, especially under significant interfacial temperature gradients where natural convection dominates. The classic Parker solution, while widely used, is physically unrealistic as it assumes adiabatic heat flux and shallow-region heat absorption. In this study, we prove that Parker's assumption is equivalent to the Dirac pulse boundary condition in mathematics. Then, we present comprehensive analytical solutions for thermal/cooling responses under Dirac and rectangular pulse excitations. By comparing with eigenfunction-based solutions for well-posed boundary conditions, we show that Parker's solution is only valid before the thermal peak. Through dimensionless processing, we further demonstrate that Parker's solution can be regarded as a limiting case of the rectangular pulse solution as the heating duration approaches zero. Furthermore, we propose a novel excitation approach, evaporative cryocooling, for thermal diffusivity measurement. This method offers a compact, low-cost, and easy-to-implement alternative to conventional excitation schemes. The theoretical model was further validated through comparison with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the cooling wall. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on an approximate quasi-continuum approach. This work examines this effect rigorously by studying evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Numerical results show that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, reaffirming the evaporative refrigeration effect. The present work further reveals that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. While the dominant mechanism is the asymmetry in the molecular distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules at the interface, additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion, similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. The impacts of key parameters, including liquid thickness, Knudsen number, and accommodation coefficient, are investigated. The numerical simulation shows that with a thicker vapor, a thinner liquid film, and a larger accommodation coefficient, leads to stronger evaporative refrigeration effect. This work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning, refrigeration, and membrane distillation.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Controlled Planar Guided Crystallization of Low-Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar guided crystallization, a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure optically uniform crystalline properties across devices is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</description>

Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling/heating within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role in discussion on their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
  leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.</description>
