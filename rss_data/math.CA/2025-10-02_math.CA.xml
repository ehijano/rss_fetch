      <title>The height function of a sparse collection: a Bellman function approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse operators have emerged as a powerful method to extract sharp constants in harmonic analysis inequalities, for example in the context of bounding singular integral operators. We investigate the level sets of height functions for sparse collections, or, in other words, weak-type (1,1) inequalities for sparse operators applied to constant functions. We use another notable method from dyadic harmonic analysis, also famous for its ability to produce sharp constants, the Bellman function method. Specifically, we find the exact Bellman function maximizing level sets of $\mathcal{A}_\alpha 1\!\!1$, where $\mathcal{A}_\alpha$ is the (localized) sparse operator associated with a binary Carleson sequence.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Curve Diagrams for a Diffusive Generalized Logistic Problem with Minkowski Curvature Operator and Constant-Yield Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bifurcation diagrams of positive solutions for a one-dimensional diffusive generalized logistic boundary-value problem with the Minkowski curvature operator and constant yield harvesting. We prove that the corresponding bifurcation curves on both the (lambda, sup-norm of u)-plane and the (mu, sup-norm of u)-plane are C-shaped. Furthermore, by characterizing the bifurcation set on the (mu, lambda)-plane, we determine the exact multiplicity of positive solutions.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous fractional integral operators on weighted Lebesgue, Morrey and Campanato spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $0&lt;\alpha&lt;n$ and $T_{\Omega,\alpha}$ be the homogeneous fractional integral operator which is defined by \begin{equation*} T_{\Omega,\alpha}f(x):=\int_{\mathbb R^n}\frac{\Omega(x-y)}{|x-y|^{n-\alpha}}f(y)\,dy, \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is homogeneous of degree zero in $\mathbb R^n$ for $n\geq2$, and is integrable on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. In this paper we study boundedness properties of the homogeneous fractional integral operator $T_{\Omega,\alpha}$ acting on weighted Lebesgue and Morrey spaces. Under certain Dini-type smoothness condition on $\Omega$, we prove that $T_{\Omega,\alpha}$ is bounded from $L^{p}(\omega^p)$ to $\mathcal{C}^{\gamma,\ell}_{\omega}$(a class of Campanato spaces) for appropriate indices, when $n/{\alpha}&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Moreover, we prove that if $\Omega$ satisfies certain Dini-type smoothness condition on $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, then $T_{\Omega,\alpha}$ is bounded from $\mathcal{M}^{p,\kappa}(\omega^p,\omega^q)$ to $\mathcal{C}^{\gamma,\ell}(\omega^q)$(weighted Campanato spaces) for appropriate indices, when $p/q&lt;\kappa&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>The generalized upper box dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the generalized upper box dimension which is defined for any set, whether the set is bounded or unbounded. We study basic properties of the generalized upper box dimension. We prove that the generalized upper box and upper box dimensions coincide for bounded sets. Furthermore, we also show that the modified generalized upper box dimension equals the packing dimension. So the generalized upper box dimension can be seen as a reasonable generalization of the upper box dimension. As an application, we prove the generalized upper box dimension is zero if and only if the quasi-Assouad dimension is zero. We also show that the upper spectrum is of full dimension is equivalent to the Assouad spectrum is of full dimension and the upper spectrum is zero is equivalent to the Assouad spectrum is zero.</description>

      <title>A refined transversality theorem on crossings and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transversality theorem is one of the most important tools in singularity theory, and it yields various applications. In this paper, we establish a refined transversality theorem on crossings from a new perspective of Hausdorff measures and give its various applications. Moreover, by using one of them, we generalize Mather's ``stability theorem for generic projections" in his celebrated paper ``Generic projections" under special dimension pairs.</description>

      <title>The p-spectrum of Random Wavelet Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of multifractal analysis is to characterize the variations in local regularity of functions or signals by computing the Hausdorff dimension of the sets of points that share the same regularity. While classical approaches rely on H\"older exponents and are limited to locally bounded functions, the notion of $p$-exponents extends multifractal analysis to functions locally in $L^p$, allowing a rigorous characterization of singularities in more general settings. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based methodology to estimate the $p$-spectrum from the distribution of wavelet coefficients across scales. First, we establish an upper bound for the $p$-spectrum in terms of this distribution, generalizing the classical H\"older case. The sharpness of this bound is demonstrated for \textit{Random Wavelet Series}, showing that it can be attained for a broad class of admissible distributions of wavelet coefficients. Finally, within the class of functions sharing a prescribed wavelet statistic, we prove that this upper bound is realized by a prevalent set of functions, highlighting both its theoretical optimality and its representativity of the typical multifractal behaviour in constrained function spaces.</description>

      <title>Continued Fractions and Irrationality Measures for Chowla--Selberg Gamma Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give 39 rapidly convergent continued fractions for Chowla--Selberg gamma quotients, and deduce good irrationality measures for 20 of them, including for $\operatorname{CS}(-3)=(\Gamma(1/3)/\Gamma(2/3))^3$, for $a^{1/4}\operatorname{CS}(-4)=a^{1/4}(\Gamma(1/4)/\Gamma(3/4))^2$ with $a=12$ and $a=1/5$, and for $\operatorname{CS}(-7)=\Gamma(1/7)\Gamma(2/7)\Gamma(4/7)/(\Gamma(3/7)\Gamma(5/7)\Gamma(6/7))$. These appear to be the first proved and reasonable irrationality measures for gamma quotients.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of Ein(1) among Linear Combinations of the Euler-Mascheroni and Euler-Gompertz Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a well-known equation of Hardy, one can derive a simple linear combination of the Euler-Mascheroni constant ($\gamma=0.577215\ldots$) and Euler-Gompertz constant ($\delta=0.596347\ldots$): $\gamma+\delta/e=\textrm{Ein}\left(1\right)$. Although neither $\gamma$ nor $\delta$ is currently known to be irrational, this linear combination has been shown to be transcendental (by virtue of the fact that it appears as an algebraic point value of a particular E-function). Moreover, both pairs ($\gamma$,$\delta$) and ($\gamma$,$\delta/e$) are known to be disjunctively transcendental. In light of these observations, we investigate the impact of the coefficient $\alpha$ in combinations of the form $\gamma+\alpha\delta$, and find that $\alpha=1/e$ is the unique coefficient value such that canonical Borel-summable divergent series for $\gamma$ and $\delta$ can be linearly combined to force conventional convergence of the resulting series. We further indicate how this uniqueness property extends to a sequence of generalized linear combinations, $\gamma^{\left(n\right)}+\alpha\delta^{\left(n\right)}$, with $\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$ and $\delta^{\left(n\right)}$ given by (ordinary and conditional) moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and numerical analysis of quantum signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) provides a representation of scalar polynomials of degree $d$ as products of matrices in $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, parameterized by $(d+1)$ real numbers known as phase factors. QSP is the mathematical foundation of quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which is often regarded as one of the most important quantum algorithms of the past decade, with a wide range of applications in scientific computing, from Hamiltonian simulation to solving linear systems of equations and eigenvalue problems. In this article we survey recent advances in the mathematical and numerical analysis of QSP. In particular, we focus on its generalization beyond polynomials, the computational complexity of algorithms for phase factor evaluation, and the numerical stability of such algorithms. The resolution to some of these problems relies on an unexpected interplay between QSP, nonlinear Fourier analysis on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, fast polynomial multiplications, and Gaussian elimination for matrices with displacement structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove $L^p$ bounds, $\frac{d^2 + 4d + 2}{(d+1)^2} &lt; p &lt; 2(d+1)$, for maximal linear modulations of singular integrals along paraboloids with frequencies in certain subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, for $d \geq 2$. This generalizes Carleson's theorem on convergence of Fourier series, and complements a corresponding result by Pierce and Yung with polynomial modulations without linear terms.</description>

Abstract: We simplify the proof of some widely used theoretical theorems, extending their applicability, while correcting some erroneous results. We also generalize key results and present new results that contribute to the development of the theory. Furthermore, we use the results obtained to investigate the monotonicity properties of some specific functions related to the Gamma function.

      <title>Middle Laplace transform and middle convolution for linear Pfaffian systems with irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a transformation of linear Pfaffian systems, which we call the middle Laplace transform, as a formulation of the Laplace transform from the perspective of Katz theory. While the definition of the middle Laplace transform is purely algebraic, its categorical interpretation is also provided. We then show the fundamental properties (invertibility, irreducibility) of the middle Laplace transform. As an application of the middle Laplace transform, we define the middle convolution for linear Pfaffian systems with irregular singularities. This gives a generalization of Haraoka's middle convolution, which was defined for linear Pfaffian systems with logarithmic singularities. The fundamental properties (additivity, irreducibility) of the middle convolution follow from the properties of the middle Laplace transform. Some examples related to hypergeometric functions with two variables are also given.</description>

      <title>Physical measures for mostly sectional expanding flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04207v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a partially hyperbolic attracting set for a C2 vector field, having slow recurrence to equilibria, supports an ergodic physical/SRB measure if, and only if, the trapping region admits non-uniform sectional expansion on a positive Lebesgue measure subset. Moreover, in this case, the attracting set supports at most finitely many ergodic physical/SRB measures, which are also Gibbs states along the central-unstable direction.
  This extends to continuous time systems a similar well-known result obtained for diffeomorphisms, encompassing the presence of equilibria accumulated by regular orbits within the attracting set. In codimension two the same result holds, assuming only the trajetories on the trapping region admit a sequence of times with asymptotical sectional expansion, on a positive volume subset.
  We present several examples of application, including the existence of physical measures for asymptotically sectional hyperbolic attracting sets, and obtain physical measures in an alternative unified way for many known examples: Lorenz-like and Rovella attractors, and sectional-hyperbolic attracting sets (including the multidimensional Lorenz attractor).</description>
