      <title>Meso-scale structures in signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meso-scale structures in signed networks have been studied under the limiting assumption of the validity of social balance theory, which predicts positive connections within groups and negative connections between groups. Here, we propose and apply a methodology that overcomes this limitation and is able to find and characterize also the different possible unbalanced structures in signed networks. Applying our methodology to 24 empirical networks, from social-political, financial, and biological domains, we find that unbalanced meso-scale structures are prevalent in real-world networks, including cases with substantial balance at the micro-scale of triangles. In particular, we find that assortativity often prevails regardless of the interaction sign and that core-periphery structures are typical in online social networks. Our findings highlight the complexity of meso-scale relational structures, the importance of using computational methods that are a priori agnostic to specific patterns, and the importance of independently evaluating micro- and meso-scale predictions of social balance theory.</description>

      <title>Complementary Strengths: Combining Geometric and Topological Approaches for Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal strategy for community detection in complex networks is not universal, but depends critically on the network's underlying structural properties. Although popular graph-theoretic methods, such as Louvain, optimize for modularity, they can overlook nuanced, geometric community structures. Conversely, topological data analysis (TDA) methods such as ToMATo are powerful in identifying density-defined clusters in embedded data but can be sensitive to initial projection. We propose a unified framework that integrates both paradigms to take advantage of their complementary advantages. Our method uses spectral embedding to capture the network's geometric skeleton, creating a landscape where communities manifest as density basins. The ToMATo algorithm then provides a topologically-grounded and parameter-aware method to extract persistent clusters from this landscape. Our comprehensive analysis across synthetic benchmarks shows that this hybrid approach is highly robust: it performs on par with Louvain on modular networks. These results argue for a new class of hybrid algorithms that select strategies based on network geometry, moving beyond one-size-fits-all solutions.</description>

      <title>Network Centrality Metrics Based on Unrestricted Paths, Walks and Cycles Compared to Standard Centrality Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key issue with standard network measures of closeness and betweenness centrality is that they rely on the shortest paths between nodes within the network structure, whereas the degree centrality only reveals the immediate neighborhood of a node. Furthermore, many measures found in the literature do not accurately represent the physical or probabilistic characteristics of nodal centrality, network flow, and other salient properties. For example, recurrent spreading in a network is often overlooked by these metrics. Standard centrality measures have limitations, being optimal for one application but not for others. Here, we present new metrics based on our influence spreading model to characterize network structure for various network science applications. These probabilistic measures account for all feasible walks and cycles in the network. We compare our new metrics with the standard metrics in terms of the node rankings given by different centrality measures, by examining scatter plots, and by using the Pearson correlation coefficient. In the influence spreading model, we define the in-centrality measure to characterize how central a node is as a target of influence by other nodes and the out-centrality measure to characterize how central a node is as a source of influence on other nodes. Our results show that the influence spreading betweenness centrality reveals the importance of alternative routes while maintaining similarity to standard betweenness centrality.</description>

      <title>A Relational Model of Neighborhood Mobility: The Role of Amenities and Cultural Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why are some neighborhoods strongly connected while others remain isolated? Although standard explanations focus on demographics, economics, and geography, movement across the city may also depend on cultural styles and amenity mix. This study proposes a relational, cross-national model in which local culture and amenity mix alignment creates a "soft infrastructure" of urban mobility, i.e., symbolic cues and functional features that shape expectations about the character of places. Using ~650 million Google Places reviews to measure co-visitation between U.S. ZIP codes and ~30 million Canadian change-of-address to track residential mobility, results show that neighborhoods with similar cultural styles and amenities are significantly more connected. These effects persist even after controlling for race, income, education, politics, housing costs, and distance. Urban cohesion and segregation depend not only on who lives where or how far apart neighborhoods are, but on the shared cultural and material ecologies that structure movement across the city.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Rich Multi-Modal Data for Spatial-Temporal Homophily-Embedded Graph Learning Across Domains and Localities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cities are increasingly reliant on data-driven insights to support decision making in areas such as transportation, public safety and environmental impact. However, city-level data often exists in heterogeneous formats, collected independently by local agencies with diverse objectives and standards. Despite their numerous, wide-ranging, and uniformly consumable nature, national-level datasets exhibit significant heterogeneity and multi-modality. This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities. The results show that our proposed framework demonstrates strong predictive performance while requiring minimal reconfiguration when transferred to new localities or domains. This research advances the goal of building data-informed urban systems in a scalable way, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in smart city analytics.</description>

      <title>Personalized Pricing in Social Networks with Individual and Group Fairness Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized pricing assigns different prices to customers for the same product based on customer-specific features to improve retailer revenue. However, this practice often raises concerns about fairness at both the individual and group levels. At the individual level, a customer may perceive unfair treatment if he/she notices being charged a higher price than others. At the group level, pricing disparities can result in discrimination against certain protected groups, such as those defined by gender or race. Existing studies on fair pricing typically address individual and group fairness separately. This paper bridges the gap by introducing a new formulation of the personalized pricing problem that incorporates both dimensions of fairness in social network settings. To solve the problem, we propose FairPricing, a novel framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that learns a personalized pricing policy using customer features and network topology. In FairPricing, individual perceived unfairness is captured through a penalty on customer demand, and thus the profit objective, while group-level discrimination is mitigated using adversarial debiasing and a price regularization term. Unlike existing optimization-based personalized pricing, which requires re-optimization whenever the network updates, the pricing policy learned by FairPricing assigns personalized prices to all customers in an updated network based on their features and the new network structure, thereby generalizing to network changes. Extensive experimental results show that FairPricing achieves high profitability while improving individual fairness perceptions and satisfying group fairness requirements.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Pruning for Distributed Closeness Centrality under Multi-Packet Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying central nodes using closeness centrality is a critical task in analyzing large-scale complex networks, yet its decentralized computation remains challenging due to high communication overhead. Existing distributed approximation techniques, such as pruning, often fail to fully mitigate the cost of exchanging numerous data packets in large network settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel enhancement to the distributed pruning method specifically designed to overcome this communication bottleneck. Our core contribution is a technique that leverages multi-packet messaging, allowing nodes to batch and transmit larger, consolidated data blocks. This approach significantly reduces the number of exchanged messages and minimizes data loss without compromising the accuracy of the centrality estimates. We demonstrate that our multi-packet approach substantially outperforms the original pruning technique in both message efficiency (fewer overall messages) and computation time, preserving the core approximation properties of the baseline method. While we observe a manageable trade-off in increased per-node memory usage and local overhead, our findings show that this is outweighed by the gains in communication efficiency, particularly for very large networks and complex packet structures. Our work offers a more scalable and efficient solution for decentralized closeness centrality computation, promising a significant step forward for large-scale network analysis.</description>

      <title>Fairness-aware PageRank via Edge Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link-analysis algorithms, such as PageRank, are instrumental in understanding the structural dynamics of networks by evaluating the importance of individual vertices based on their connectivity. Recently, with the rising importance of responsible AI, the question of fairness in link-analysis algorithms has gained traction. In this paper, we present a new approach for incorporating group fairness into the PageRank algorithm by reweighting the transition probabilities in the underlying transition matrix. We formulate the problem of achieving fair PageRank by seeking to minimize the fairness loss, which is the difference between the original group-wise PageRank distribution and a target PageRank distribution. We further define a group-adapted fairness notion, which accounts for group homophily by considering random walks with group-biased restart for each group. Since the fairness loss is non-convex, we propose an efficient projected gradient-descent method for computing locally-optimal edge weights. Unlike earlier approaches, we do not recommend adding new edges to the network, nor do we adjust the restart vector. Instead, we keep the topology of the underlying network unchanged and only modify the relative importance of existing edges. We empirically compare our approach with state-of-the-art baselines and demonstrate the efficacy of our method, where very small changes in the transition matrix lead to significant improvement in the fairness of the PageRank algorithm.</description>

      <title>Measuring Online Behavior Change with Observational Studies: a Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring online behavior change is imperative for societal progress in the context of 21st-century challenges. We analyze 148 articles (2000-2023) focusing on behavior change in the digital space and build a map that categorizes behaviors, behavior change detection methodologies, platforms of reference, and theoretical frameworks that characterize the analysis of online behavior change. Our findings reveal a focus on sentiment shifts, an emphasis on API-restricted platforms, and limited integration of theory. We call for methodologies able to capture a wider range of behavior types, diverse data sources, and stronger theory-practice alignment in the study of online behavior and its change.</description>
