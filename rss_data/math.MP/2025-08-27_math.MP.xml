      <title>The Stationary Klein-Gordon Equation with a Delta-like Source: A Generalized Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to initiate a discussion on finding solutions to non-homoge\-neous differential equations in terms of generalized functions. For simplicity, we conduct the analysis within the specific context of the stationary Klein-Gordon equation with a point-like source, identifying a generalized function that solves such an equation and aligns with the solution obtained through the Fourier approach with dimensional regularization. In addition to being regular at the source singularity, a notable advantage of our solution is its presentation as a single expression, eliminating the need for piecewise definitions. The arguments presented here are applicable to a broader range of situations, offering a novel approach to addressing divergences in field theories using generalized functions. Moreover, we anticipate that the approach introduced in this work could provide a new method for handling Green functions regularized at coincident points, thereby simplifying the renorma\-lization process in a wide range of theories.</description>

      <title>The Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy: Correspondence between the isomonodromic approach and the minimal models of the KP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two approaches to the Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy are discussed: the isomonodromic construction based on meromorphic connections, and the minimal models construction based on a reduction of the KP hierarchy. An explicit correspondence between both formalisms is built which gives the identification of these setups. In particular, this provides new expressions for the Lax matrices and Hamiltonians.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove equivalence of two integral representations for the wave functions of hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland system. For this we study two families of Baxter operators related to hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland and rational Ruijsenaars models; the first one as a limit from hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system, while the second one independently. Besides, computing asymptotics of integral representations and also the value at zero point, we identify them with renormalized Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Travelling-wave solutions and solitons of KdV, mKdV and NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of soliton solutions of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations and point out that the inverse spectral method represents the rigorous mathematical formalism to construct such solutions. We work with the travelling waves of the KdV, mKdV and nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equations and derive a pedagogic method to find their soliton solutions. The travelling wave of the KdV equation leads directly to the well known bell type KdV soliton while the mKdV equation needs some additional consideration in respect of this. The travelling waves of a generalized mKdV and NLS equations are obtained in terms of $sn(u,m)$, the so called Jacobi elliptic sine function. The choice $m=1$ provides a constraint on the parameters of the equations and gives their kink and anti-kink soliton solutions.
  We further show that by expressing the travelling waves of these equations in terms of Jacobi elliptic cosine functions, $cn(u,m)$, it is possible to construct bell-type soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Segal-Bargmann transform for Poisson distribution revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\sigma &gt; 0$, we consider the following probability distribution on $\alpha\mathbb N_0$: $\pi_{\alpha,\sigma} = \exp \big(- \frac{\sigma}{{\alpha}^2}\big) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \big(\frac{\sigma}{{\alpha}^2}\big)^n {\delta}_{\alpha n}$, where $\delta_y$ denotes the Dirac measure with mass at $y$. For $\alpha=1$, $\pi_{1,\sigma}$ is the Poisson distribution with parameter $\sigma$. Furthermore, the centered probability distribution $\tilde \pi_{\alpha,\sigma} = \exp \big(- \frac{\sigma}{{\alpha}^2}\big) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \big(\frac{\sigma}{{\alpha}^2}\big)^n {\delta}_{\alpha n-\sigma/\alpha}$ weakly converges to $\mu_\sigma$ as $\alpha\to0$. Here $\mu_\sigma$ is the Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance $\sigma$. Let $(c_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ be the monic polynomial sequence that is orthogonal with respect to the measure $\mu_{\alpha,\sigma}$. In particular, for $\alpha=1$, $(c_n)_{n=0}^\infty$ is a sequence of Charlier polynomials. Let $\mathbb F_\sigma(\mathbb C)$ denote the Bargmann space of all entire functions $f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_nz^n$ with $f_n \in \mathbb C$ satisfying $ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {| f_n |}^2 \, n! \, \sigma^n &lt; \infty$. The generalized Segal--Bargmann transform associated with the measure $\pi_{\alpha,\sigma}$ is a unitary operator $\mathcal S:L^2(\alpha\mathbb N_0,\pi_{\alpha,\sigma})\to \mathbb F_\sigma(\mathbb C)$ that satisfies $(\mathcal Sc_n)(z)=z^n$ for $n\in\mathbb N_0$. We present some new results related to the operator $\mathcal S$. In particular, we observe how the study of $\mathcal S$ naturally leads to the normal ordering in the Weyl algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time-periodic solutions to the nonlinear wave and beam equations and uncover their intricate, fractal-like structure. In particular, we identify a new class of large-energy solutions with complex mode compositions and propose a systematic framework for their analysis. A Floquet stability study reveals that this class contains solutions that are linearly stable, suggesting that they may play a significant role in the nonlinear dynamics of the systems.</description>

      <title>The projection spectral theorem, quasi-free states and point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review paper, we demonstrate that several classes of point processes in a locally compact Polish space $X$ appear as the joint spectral measure of a rigorously defined particle density of a representation of the canonical anticommutation relations (CAR) or the canonical commutation relations (CCR) in a Fock space. For these representations of the CAR/CCR, the vacuum state on the corresponding $*$-algebra is quasi-free. The classes of point process that arise in such a way include determinantal and permanental point processes.</description>

Abstract: We show how the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model can be understood as a Carrollian limit of the Holst term in the context of background-independent field theories described in terms of coframes and spin connections. We also discuss the footprint of the Carrollian symmetry in the Hamiltonian formulation of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} action.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Full twists and stability of knots and quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the stability of knot invariants under twisting a pair of strands to the stability of symmetric quivers under unlinking (or linking) operation. Starting from the HOMFLY-PT skein relations, we confirm the stable growth of $Sym^r$-coloured HOMFLY-PT polynomials under the addition of a~full twist to the knot. On the other hand, we show that symmetric quivers exhibit analogous stable growth under unlinking or linking of the quiver augmented with the extra node; in some cases this augmented quiver captures the spectrum of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of all quivers in the sequence. Combining these two versions of the stable growth, we conjecture that performing a~full twist on any knot corresponds to appropriate unlinking or linking of the corresponding augmented quiver -- this statement is an important step towards a~direct definition of the knot-quiver correspondence based on the knot diagram. We confirm the conjecture for all twist knots, $(2,2p+1)$ torus knots, and all pretzel knots up to 15 crossings with an~odd number of twists in each twist region.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Feynman Integrals in the Parametric Representation IV: Integrals with Irregular Integration Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric Feynman integrals with the regions of integration defined by some polynomials are considered in this paper. It is shown that integrals with irregular integration regions can be converted to standard parametric integrals, for which a reduction method is known. An application of this method to the analytic calculation of three-point energy correlators is presented. In principle, this method applies to more general event shapes and even jet observables.</description>

      <title>Random punctured hyperbolic surfaces &amp; the Brownian sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random genus-0 hyperbolic surfaces $\mathcal{S}_n$ with $n + 1$ punctures, sampled according to the Weil-Petersson measure. We show that, after rescaling the metric by $n^{-1/4}$, the surface $\mathcal{S}_n$ converges in distribution to the Brownian sphere - a random compact metric space homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, exhibiting fractal geometry and appearing as a universal scaling limit in various models of random planar maps. Without rescaling the metric, we establish a local Benjamini--Schramm convergence of $\mathcal{S}_n$ to a random infinite-volume hyperbolic surface with countably many punctures, homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \mathbb{Z}^2$. Our proofs mirror techniques from the theory of random planar maps. In particular, we develop an encoding of punctured hyperbolic surfaces via a family of plane trees with continuous labels, akin to Schaeffer's bijection. This encoding stems from the Epstein-Penner decomposition and, through a series of transformations, reduces to a model of single-type Galton--Watson trees, enabling the application of known invariance principles.</description>

      <title>Critical long-range percolation I: High effective dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, points $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge with probability $1-\exp(-\beta\|x-y\|^{-d-\alpha})$, where $\alpha&gt;0$ is fixed and $\beta \geq 0$ is a parameter. As $d$ and $\alpha$ vary, the model is conjectured to exhibit eight qualitatively different second-order critical behaviours, with a transition between mean-field and low-dimensional regimes when $d=\min\{6,3\alpha\}$, a transition between long- and short-range regimes at a crossover value $\alpha_c(d)$, and with various logarithmic corrections at the boundaries between these regimes.
  This is the first of a series of three papers developing a rigorous theory of the model's critical behavior in five of these eight regimes, including all long-range (LR) and high-dimensional (HD) regimes. In this paper, we introduce our non-perturbative real-space renormalization group method and apply this method to analyze the HD regime $d&gt;\min\{6,3\alpha\}$. In particular, we compute the tail of the cluster volume and establish the superprocess scaling limits of the model, which transition between super-Levy and super-Brownian behavior when $\alpha=2$. All our results hold unconditionally for $d&gt; 3\alpha$, without any perturbative assumptions on the model; beyond this regime, when $d&gt; 6$ and $\alpha \geq d/3$, they hold under the assumption that appropriate two-point function estimates hold as provided for spread-out models by the lace expansion. Our results on scaling limits also hold (with possible slowly-varying corrections to scaling) in the critical-dimensional regime with $d=3\alpha&lt;6$ subject to a marginal-triviality condition we call the hydrodynamic condition; this condition is verified in the third paper in this series, in which we also compute the precise logarithmic corrections to mean-field scaling when $d=3\alpha&lt;6$.</description>

      <title>Critical long-range percolation II: Low effective dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, points $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge with probability $1-\exp(-\beta\|x-y\|^{-d-\alpha})$, where $\alpha&gt;0$ is fixed and $\beta \geq 0$ is a parameter. As $d$ and $\alpha$ vary, the model is conjectured to exhibit eight qualitatively different second-order critical behaviours, with a transition between mean-field and low-dimensional regimes when $d=\min\{6,3\alpha\}$, a transition between long- and short-range regimes at a crossover value $\alpha_c(d)$, and with various logarithmic corrections at the boundaries between these regimes.
  This is the second of three papers developing a rigorous theory of the model's critical behavior in five of these eight regimes, including all long-range (LR) and high-dimensional (HD) regimes. We focus on the long-range low-dimensional (LR-LD) regime $d/3&lt;\alpha&lt;\alpha_c(d)$, where the model is below its upper critical dimension. Since computing $\alpha_c(d)$ for $2&lt;d&lt;6$ appears to be beyond the scope of current techniques, we give an axiomatic definition of the LR regime which we prove holds for $\alpha &lt;1$. Using this, we prove up-to-constants estimates for the critical and slightly subcritical two-point function in the LR regime and for the volume tail and $k$-point function in the LR-LD regime. We deduce that the critical exponents satisfy the identities \[
  \eta = 2-\alpha, \qquad \gamma = (2-\eta)\nu, \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \Delta = \nu d_f \] in the LR regime (if $\gamma$, $\nu$, or $\Delta$ is well-defined) and that $\delta$ and $d_f$ follow the hyperscaling identities \[
  \delta = \frac{d+\alpha}{d-\alpha} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad d_f = \frac{d+\alpha}{2} \] in the LR-LD regime. Our results are suggestive of conformal invariance in the LR-LD regime, with the critical $k$-point function matching an explicit M\"obius-covariant function up-to-constants.</description>

      <title>Critical long-range percolation III: The upper critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, points $x$ and $y$ are connected by an edge with probability $1-\exp(-\beta\|x-y\|^{-d-\alpha})$, where $\alpha&gt;0$ is fixed and $\beta \geq 0$ is a parameter. As $d$ and $\alpha$ vary, the model is conjectured to exhibit eight qualitatively different second-order critical behaviours, with a transition between mean-field and low-dimensional regimes when $d=\min\{6,3\alpha\}$, a transition between long- and short-range regimes at a crossover value $\alpha_c(d)$, and with various logarithmic corrections at the boundaries between these regimes.
  This is the second of three papers developing a rigorous theory of the model's critical behavior in five of these eight regimes, including all long-range (LR) and high-dimensional (HD) regimes. Here, we analyze the model at its upper critical dimension $d=3\alpha&lt;6$. We prove the hydrodynamic condition holds, which allows us to apply our first paper's RG analysis to deduce that the model has the same superprocess scaling limits as in high dimension, after accounting for slowly varying corrections to scaling. We then compute the precise logarithmic corrections to scaling by analyzing the RG flow to second order. Our results yield in particular that for $d=3\alpha &lt; 6$ the critical volume tail is \[
  \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(|K|\geq n) \sim C \frac{(\log n)^{1/4}}{\sqrt{n}} \] as $n\to \infty$, while the critical two- and three-point functions are \[ \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(x\leftrightarrow y) \asymp \|x-y\|^{-d+\alpha} \; \text{ and } \; \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(x\leftrightarrow y \leftrightarrow z) \asymp \sqrt{\frac{\|x-y\|^{-d+\alpha}\|y-z\|^{-d+\alpha}\|z-x\|^{-d+\alpha}}{\log(1+\min\{\|x-y\|,\|y-z\|,\|z-x\|\})}}. \] These logarithmic corrections match those in hierarchical percolation but differ from those conjectured for nearest-neighbour percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^6$.</description>

      <title>The LMO Spectrum: Factorization Homology and the E_3-Structure of the Jacobi Diagram Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for the categorification of the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki (LMO) invariant of 3-manifolds, defining a new invariant, the LMO Spectrum, via factorization homology. The theoretical foundation of this framework is the main algebraic result of this paper (Theorem A): a proof that the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, A_Jac, possesses the structure of a homotopy E3-algebra. This algebraic structure is shown to be a consequence of 3-dimensional geometry, originating from a "Tetrahedron Principle" where the fundamental IHX relation is interpreted as an algebraic manifestation of the tetrahedron's combinatorial properties. This geometric perspective is used to provide a rigorous proof of the "Principle of Decomposability" that underpins the Goussarov-Habiro clasper calculus, thereby supplying a mathematical justification for the consistency of this geometric surgery theory. To establish a computational basis, the framework is built from the first principles of factorization homology, from which a universal surgery formula is derived via the excision axiom (Theorem B) independently of any conjectural models. The utility of this axiomatically-grounded theory is demonstrated by constructing a new observable, the "H_1-decorated LMO invariant." This invariant is defined in accordance with the principles of TQFT, where the evaluation of a closed diagram (a numerical invariant) is the trace of the corresponding open diagram (an operator). As the main applied result of this paper (Theorem C), it is proven that this invariant distinguishes the lens spaces L(156, 5) and L(156, 29), a pair known to be indistinguishable by the classical LMO invariant. This result validates the proposed framework and establishes the LMO Spectrum as a new tool in quantum topology that unifies the geometric intuition of clasper theory with the algebraic rigor of modern homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Resurgence for large $c$ expansion in Coulomb gas formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a resurgence analysis for large central charge (large $C$) expansions in two-dimensional CFTs using the Coulomb gas formalism. Through the exact Borel-Laplace representations of the conformal blocks $I_1(C,z)$ and $I_2(C,z)$ associated with the four-point correlation function $ \langle \phi_{2,1}(0)\phi_{2,1}(z,\bar{z})\phi_{2,1}(1)\phi_{2,1}(\infty)\rangle$, we demonstrate that $I_1(C,z)$ participates in the Stokes phenomenon of $I_2(C,z)$ (and vice versa), and establish that monodromy in $z$ arises from alien calculus in the Borel plane variable $\zeta$ (Borel dual to $C$). From a given conformal block, resurgence theory thus enables us to discover other internal operators (conformal blocks). This approach establishes a non-perturbative connection between conformal blocks, shedding light on the resurgence phenomena in more general quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Explicit Inversion of the Attenuated Photoacoustic Operator in General Observation Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive explicit reconstruction formulas for two common measurement geometries: a plane and a sphere. The problem is formulated as inverting the forward operator $R^a$, which maps the initial source to the measured wave data. Our first result pertains to planar observation surfaces. By extending the domain of $R^a$ to tempered distributions, we provide a complete characterization of its range and establish that the inverse operator $(R^a)^{-1}$ is uniquely defined and "almost" continuous in the distributional topology. Our second result addresses the case of a spherical observation geometry. Here, with the operator acting on $L^2$ spaces, we derive a stable reconstruction formula of the filtered backprojection type.</description>

      <title>Efficient and scalable inter-module switching for distributed quantum computing architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers of the future will likely be modular by necessity or by design. Modularity is inevitable if the substrate cannot support the desired error-correction code due to its planar geometry or manufacturing constraints resulting in a limited number of logical qubits per module. Even if the computer is compact enough there may be functional requirements to distribute the quantum computation substrate over distant regions of varying scales. In both cases, matter-based quantum information, such as spins, ions or neutral atoms, is the most conveniently transmitted or mediated by photonic interconnects. To avoid long algorithm execution times and reduce errors, each module of a universal quantum computer should be dynamically interconnected with as many other modules as possible. This task relies on an optical switching network providing any-to-any or sufficiently high simultaneous connectivity. In this work we construct several novel and decentralized switching schemes based on the properties of the Generalized Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (GMZI) that are more economic and less noisy compared to commonly considered alternatives while achieving the same functionality.</description>

      <title>New Twists on Topological Quantum Error Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a new family of quantum error-correcting codes. The main technical tool used to do so is the physically intuitive concept of condensation, which is employed to create new domain walls between the quantum double of $\Z_4$ and an instance of the doubled semion phase. Specifically, we provide explicit constructions, first at the lattice-level and then subsequently at the macroscopic logical-level. To provide intuition, we provide a series of explicit examples using the derived topological interfaces. We discuss the code's utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error-correction with an emphasis on the interplay between logical error rates and decoding.
  We conclude by outlining how such codes' representation and design can be automated. We expect our results, which provide explicit step-by-step instructions in the form of algorithms, to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in configurations that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</description>

Abstract: We study the distribution of resonances for discrete Hamiltonians of the form $H_0+V$ near the thresholds of the spectrum of $H_0$. Here, the unperturbed operator $H_0$ is a multichannel Laplace type operator on $\ell^2(\mathbb Z; \mathbb C^N) \cong \ell^2(\mathbb Z)\otimes \mathbb C^N$ and $V$ is a non-selfadjoint compact perturbation. We compute the exact number of resonances and give a precise description on their location in clusters around some special points in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Convergent Power Series for Anharmonic Chain with Periodic Forcing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23527v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the propagation of energy in one-dimensional anharmonic chains subject to a periodic, localized forcing. For the purely harmonic case, forcing frequencies outside the linear spectrum produce exponentially localized responses, preventing equi-distribution of energy per degree of freedom. We extend this result to anharmonic perturbations with bounded second derivatives and boundary dissipation, proving that for small perturbations and non-resonant forcing, the dynamics converges to a periodic stationary state with energy exponentially localized uniformly in the system size. The perturbed periodic state is described by a convergent power type expansion in the strength of the anharmonicity. This excludes chaoticity induced by anharmonicity, independently of the size of the system. Our perturbative scheme can also be applied in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional block disordered subwavelength resonator systems subject to non-reciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation against the non-Hermitian skin effect, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.</description>

Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering supercritical Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, Garet and Marchand [GM09] proved a diffusive concentration for the graph distance. In this paper, we sharpen this result by establishing the subdiffusive concentration inequality, which revisits the sublinear bound of the variance proved by Dembin [Dem22] as a consequence. Our approach is inspired by similar work in First-passage percolation [BR08, DHS14], combined with new tools to address the challenge posed by the infinite weight of the model. These tools, including the notion of effective radius and its properties, enable a simple one-step renormalization process as a systematic means of managing the effects of resampling edges.</description>

      <title>Continuity bounds for quantum entropies arising from a fundamental entropic inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a tight upper bound for the difference in von Neumann entropies between two quantum states, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. This bound is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived from the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator $(\rho_1 - \rho_2)$. This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the well-known Audenaert-Fannes (AF) inequality. In fact, it also leads to a refinement of the AF inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive a continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables. Interestingly, the fundamental entropic inequality is also valid in infinite dimensions.</description>

Abstract: This work explores the rich structure of spherically symmetric time-periodic solutions of the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$. We discover that the families of solutions bifurcating from the eigenmodes of the linearised equation form patterns similar to the ones observed for the cubic wave equation. Alongside the Galerkin approaches, we study them using the new method based on the Pad\'{e} approximants. To do so, we provide a rigorous perturbative construction of solutions. Due to the conformal symmetry, the solutions presented in this work serve as examples of large time-periodic solutions of the conformally coupled scalar field on the anti-de Sitter background.</description>

Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.</description>

Abstract: We give a new proof of the operator extension of the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy $\rho_{AB} \otimes \sigma_{C}^{-1} \leq \rho_{A} \otimes \sigma_{BC}^{-1}$ by identifying the mathematical structure behind it as Connes' theory of spatial derivatives. This immediately generalizes the inequality to arbitrary inclusions of von Neumann algebras. In the case of standard representations, it reduces to the monotonicity of the relative modular operator.</description>

      <title>An infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov theorem and the construction of almost periodic breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov theorems based on nonresonant frequencies of Bourgain's Diophantine type or even weaker conditions. To be more precise, under a nondegenerate condition for an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, we prove the persistence of a full-dimensional KAM torus with the universally prescribed frequency that is independent of any spectral asymptotics. As an application, we prove that for a class of perturbed networks with weakly coupled oscillators described by \[\frac{{{{\rm d}^2}{x_n}}}{{{\rm d}{t^2}}} + V'\left( {{x_n}} \right) = \varepsilon_n {W'\left( {{x_{n + 1}} - {x_n}} \right) - \varepsilon_{n-1}W'\left( {{x_n} - {x_{n - 1}}} \right)} ,\;\;n \in \mathbb{Z},\] or even for more general perturbed networks, almost periodic breathers with frequency-preserving do exist, provided that the local potential $ V $ and the coupling potential $ W $ satisfy certain assumptions. In particular, this yields the first frequency-preserving version of the Aubry-MacKay conjecture [8,21].</description>
