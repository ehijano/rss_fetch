      <title>Finding all solutions of qKZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [MV] the difference qKZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$ and a family of polynomial solutions of the qKZ equations modulo $p$ was constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper, we study in detail the first family of nontrivial example of the qKZ equations in characteristic $p$. We describe all solutions of these qKZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. We also prove a Lagrangian property (called the orthogonality property) of the subbundle of the qKZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections. This paper extends the results of [VV1] on the differential KZ equations to the difference qKZ equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Matrix Product States in the Heisenberg Picture: Projectivity, Ergodicity, and Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Heisenberg picture approach to Matrix Product States (MPS), offering a rigorous yet intuitive framework to explore their structure and classification. MPS efficiently represent ground states of quantum many-body systems, with infinite MPS (iMPS) capturing long-range correlations and thermodynamic behavior. We classify MPS into projective and non-projective types, distinguishing those with finite correlation structures from those requiring ergodic quantum channels to define a meaningful limit. Using the Markov-Dobrushin inequality, we establish conditions for infinite-volume states and introduce ergodic and mixing MPS. As an application, we analyze the depolarizing MPS, highlighting its lack of finite correlations and the need for an alternative ergodic description. This work deepens the mathematical foundations of MPS and iMPS, providing new insights into entanglement, phase transitions, and quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New non-perturbative results on the eigenvalues of the spheroidal equation are presented. The results, found using an all orders WKB analysis, include a perturbative/non-perturbative (P/NP) relation as well as the first exponential correction to the perturbative series which is valid in certain regions of parameters. The quantum periods are also computed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper solves ``The Dry Ten Martini Problem'' for $C^2$ cosine-type quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators with large coupling constants and Diophantine frequencies, a model originally introduced by Sinai in 1987 \cite{sinai}. This shows that the analyticity assumption on the potential is not essential for obtaining a dry Cantor spectrum and can be replaced by a certain geometric condition in the low regularity case. In addition, we prove the homogeneity of the spectrum and the absolute continuity of the integrated density of states (IDS).</description>

      <title>Persistence of hyperbolic solutions of ODE's under functional perturbations: Applications to the motion of relativistic charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously construct a variety of orbits for certain delay differential equations, including the electrodynamic equations formulated by Wheeler and Feynman in 1949. These equations involve delays and advances that depend on the trajectory itself, making it unclear how to formulate them as evolution equations in a conventional phase space. Despite their fundamental significance in physics, their mathematical treatment remains limited.
  Our method applies broadly to various functional differential equations that have appeared in the literature, including advanced/delayed equations, neutral or state-dependent delay equations, and nested delay equations, under appropriate regularity assumptions.
  Rather than addressing the notoriously difficult problem of proving the existence of solutions for all the initial conditions in a set, we focus on the direct construction of a diverse collection of solutions. This approach is often sufficient to describe physical phenomena. For instance, in certain models, we establish the existence of families of solutions exhibiting symbolic dynamics.
  Our method is based on the assumption that the system is, in a weak sense, close to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with "hyperbolic" solutions as defined in dynamical systems. We then derive functional equations to obtain space-time corrections.
  As a byproduct of the method, we obtain that the solutions constructed depend very smoothly on parameters of the model. Also, we show that many formal approximations currently used in physics are valid with explicit error terms. Several of the relations between different orbits of the ODE persist qualitatively in the full problem.</description>

      <title>Non-modal effects in black hole perturbation theory: Transient Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-modal stability of black hole spacetimes under linear perturbations. We show that large-amplitude growth can occur at finite time, despite asymptotic decay of linear perturbations. In the example presented, the physical mechanism is a transient form of superradiance, and is qualitatively similar to the transition to turbulence in Navier-Stokes shear flows. As part of the construction we provide a theorem for the positivity of QNM energies, and introduce a truncated-Hamiltonian approach to black hole pseudospectra which does not suffer from convergence issues.</description>

      <title>Quantum Schrodinger bridges: large deviations and time-symmetric ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum counterparts of Schrodinger's classical bridge problem have been around for the better part of half a century. During that time, several quantum approaches to this multifaceted classical problem have been introduced. In the present work, we unify, extend, and interpret several such approaches through a classical large deviations perspective. To this end, we consider time-symmetric ensembles that are pre- and post-selected before and after a Markovian experiment is performed. The Schrodinger bridge problem is that of finding the most likely joint distribution of initial and final outcomes that is consistent with obtained endpoint results. The derived distribution provides quantum Markovian dynamics that bridge the observed endpoint states in the form of density matrices. The solution retains its classical structure in that density matrices can be expressed as the product of forward-evolving and backward-evolving matrices. In addition, the quantum Schrodinger bridge allows inference of the most likely distribution of outcomes of an intervening measurement with unknown results. This distribution may be written as a product of forward- and backward-evolving expressions, in close analogy to the classical setting, and in a time-symmetric way. The derived results are illustrated through a two-level amplitude damping example.</description>

      <title>Riccati-type pseudo-potential approach to quasi-integrability of deformed soliton theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review paper explores the Riccati-type pseudo-potential formulation applied to the quasi-integrable sine-Gordon, KdV, and NLS models. The proposed framework provides a unified methodology for analyzing quasi-integrability properties across various integrable systems, including deformations of the sine-Gordon, Bullough-Dodd, Toda, KdV, pKdV, NLS and SUSY sine-Gordon models. Key findings include the emergence of infinite towers of anomalous conservation laws within the Riccati-type approach and the identification of exact non-local conservation laws in the linear formulations of deformed models. As modified integrable models play a crucial role in diverse fields of non-linear physics-such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superconductivity, gravity models, optics, and soliton turbulence-these results may have far-reaching applications.</description>

      <title>The Nilpotency Index for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-developed classification program for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ super conformal field theories (SCFTs) leverages Seiberg-Witten geometry on the Coulomb branch of vacua; theories are arranged by increasing $\mathfrak{rank}$, the complex dimension of their Coulomb branch. An alternative organizational scheme focusses on the associated vertex operator algebra (VOA), which is more closely related to the Higgs branch. From the VOA perspective, a natural way to arrange theories is by their ``index of nilpotency'', the smallest integer $\mathfrak{n}$ such that $T^\mathfrak{n} = 0$ in the $C_2$ algebra, where $T$ is the VOA stress tensor. It follows from the Higgs branch reconstruction conjecture that $\mathfrak{n} &lt; \infty$ for any 4d ${\cal N}=2$ SCFT. Extrapolating from several examples, we conjecture that $\mathfrak{n}$ is an RG monotone, $\mathfrak{n}_{\rm IR} \leq \mathfrak{n}_{\rm UV}$. What's more, we find in all cases that $\mathfrak{rank} \leq \mathfrak{n}-1$. Theory ordering by $\mathfrak{n}$ appears thus more refined than ordering by $\mathfrak{rank}$. For example, in the list of $\mathfrak{rank}=1$ theories, the Kodaira SCFTs and $SU(2)$ ${\cal N}=4$ SYM have $\mathfrak{n} =2$, while all others have $\mathfrak{n} &gt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hirota's discrete KdV (dKdV) equation is an integrable autonomous partial difference equation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that reduces to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in a continuum limit. In this paper, we introduce a new non-autonomous version of the dKdV equation. Furthermore, we show that the new equation is integrable and admits discrete Painlev\'e transcendent solutions described by $q$-Painlev\'e equations of $A_J^{(1)}$-surface types ($J=3,4,5,6$).</description>

      <title>Functional perturbation theory under axisymmetry: Simplified formulae and their uses for tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strictly axisymmetric configurations of tokamaks, field-line tracing reduces from a three-dimensional ODE system to a two-dimensional one, where Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem applies and guarantees the nonexistence of chaos. The formulae of functional perturbation theory (FPT) mostly simplify to compact closed-form expressions to allow the computation to finish instantly, which could improve and accelerate the existing plasma control systems by detangling the plasma dynamics from the magnetic topology change. FPT can conveniently calculate how the key geometric objects of magnetic topology:
  1. the divertor X-point(s) and the magnetic axis,
  2. the last closed flux surface (LCFS)
  3. flux surfaces
  change under perturbation. For example, when the divertor X-point shifts outwards, the LCFS there must expand accordingly, but not necessarily for other places of the LCFS, which could also contract, depending on the perturbation. FPT can not only facilitate adaptive control of plasma, but also enable utilizing as much as possible space in the vacuum vessel by weakening the plasma-wall interaction (PWI) via tuning the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{DP}^m$ of the divertor X-point(s), such that the field line connection lengths in the scrape-off layer (SOL) are long enough to achieve detachment. Increasing flux expansion $f_x$ is another option for detachment and can also be facilitated by FPT.
  Apart from the edge, FPT can also benefit the understanding of the plasma core. Since the magnetic axis O-point would also shift under perturbation and the shift is known by FPT, the O-point can be controlled without full knowledge of the plasma response, which shall not significantly change the tendency.</description>

      <title>The initial-to-final-state inverse problem with time-independent potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial-to-final-state inverse problem consists in determining a quantum Hamiltonian assuming the knowledge of the state of the system at some fixed time, for every initial state. This problem was formulated by Caro and Ruiz and motivated by the data-driven prediction problem in quantum mechanics. Caro and Ruiz analysed the question of uniqueness for Hamiltonians of the form $-\Delta + V$ with an electric potential $V = V(\mathrm{t}, \mathrm{x})$ that depends on the time and space variables. In this context, they proved that uniqueness holds in dimension $n \geq 2$ whenever the potentials are bounded and have super-exponential decay at infinity. Although their result does not seem to be optimal, one would expect at least some degree of exponential decay to be necessary for the potentials. However, in this paper, we show that by restricting the analysis to Hamiltonians with time-independent electric potentials, namely $V = V(\mathrm{x})$, uniqueness can be established for bounded integrable potentials exhibiting only super-linear decay at infinity, in any dimension $n \geq 2$. This surprising improvement is possible because, unlike Caro and Ruiz's approach, our argument avoids the use of complex geometrical optics (CGO). Instead, we rely on the construction of stationary states at different energies -- this is possible because the potential does not depend on time. These states will have an explicit leading term, given by a Herglotz wave, plus a correction term that will vanish as the energy grows. Besides the significant relaxation of decay assumptions on the potential, the avoidance of CGO solutions is important in its own right, since such solutions are not readily available in more complicated geometric settings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the Wigner distribution and the star exponential function for a time-dependent harmonic oscillator for which the mass and the frequency terms are considered explicitly depending on time. To such an end, we explore the connection between the star exponential, naturally emerging within the context of deformation quantization, and the propagators constructed through the path integral formalism. In particular, the Fourier-Dirichlet expansion of the star exponential implies a distinctive quantization of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant. Further, by introducing a judicious time variable, we recovered a time-dependent phase function associated with the Lewis-Riesenfeld construction of the standard Schr\"odinger picture. In particular, we applied our results to the cases of the Caldirola-Kanai and the time-dependent frequency harmonic oscillators, recovering relevant results previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation transition in the Wigner minor process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Wigner minor process, i.e. the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix $H^{(N)}$ together with the eigenvalues of all its $n\times n$ minors, $H^{(n)}$, $n\le N$. The top eigenvalues of $H^{(N)}$ and those of its immediate minor $H^{(N-1)}$ are very strongly correlated, but this correlation becomes weaker for smaller minors $H^{(N-k)}$ as $k$ increases. For the GUE minor process the critical transition regime around $k\sim N^{2/3}$ was analyzed by Forrester and Nagao (J. Stat. Mech.: Theory and Experiment, 2011) providing an explicit formula for the nontrivial joint correlation function. We prove that this formula is universal, i.e. it holds for the Wigner minor process. Moreover, we give a complete analysis of the sub- and supercritical regimes both for eigenvalues and for the corresponding eigenvector overlaps, thus we prove the decorrelation transition in full generality.</description>

      <title>Gauged supergravities: solutions with Killing tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform full integration of the stationary axisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory with and without potential using a recently proposed generalization of Carter's approach to spacetimes beyond type D, allowing the Killing tensor. Crucial to our construction is a new parametrization of the dilaton and axion fields based on the analyticity argument. The general solution in the ungauged case is asymptotically locally flat and contains two more parameters compared to EMDA black holes previously obtained using Harrison transformations. In the gauged case, the general solution is asymptotically AdS and includes flat and hyperbolic topological solutions, as well as generalization of the Kerr-Sen-AdS metric with three additional parameters. Our approach can be applied to more general four-dimensional ungauged and gauged supergravities.</description>

      <title>On the Representation Categories of Weak Hopf Algebras Arising from Levin-Wen Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their study of Levin-Wen models [Commun. Math. Phys. 313 (2012) 351-373], Kitaev and Kong proposed a weak Hopf algebra associated with a unitary fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ and a unitary left $\mathcal{C}$-module $\mathcal{M}$, and sketched a proof that its representation category is monoidally equivalent to the unitary $\mathcal{C}$-module functor category $\mathrm{Fun}^{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M})^\mathrm{rev}$. We give an independent proof of this result without the unitarity conditions. In particular, viewing $\mathcal{C}$ as a left $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{rev}}$-module, we obtain a quasi-triangular weak Hopf algebra whose representation category is braided equivalent to the Drinfeld center $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. In the appendix, we also compare this quasi-triangular weak Hopf algebra with the tube algebra $\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ when $\mathcal{C}$ is pivotal. These two algebras are Morita equivalent by the well-known equivalence $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}})\cong\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. However, we show that in general there is no weak Hopf algebra structure on $\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}}$ such that the above equivalence is monoidal.</description>

      <title>An automatic approach to develop the fourth-order and L^2-stable lattice Boltzmann model for diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how to develop a high-order multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) model for the general d(&gt;=1)-dimensional diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Such an MRT-LB model considers the transformation matrix constructed in a natural way and the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure. A key step in developing the high-order MRT-LB model is to determine the adjustable relaxation parameters and weight coefficients, which are used to eliminate the truncation errors at certain orders of the MRT-LB model, while ensuring the stability of the MRT-LB model. In this work, we first present a unified MRT-LB model for the diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Then, through the direct Taylor expansion, we analyze the macroscopic modified equations of the MRT-LB model up to fourth-order, and further derive the fourth-order consistent conditions of the MRT-LB model. Additionally, we also construct the fourth-order initialization scheme for the present LB method. After that, the condition which guarantees that the MRT-LB model can satisfy the stability structure is explicitly given, and from a numerical perspective, once the stability structure is satisfied, the MRT-LB model must be L^2 stable. In combination with the fourth-order consistent and L^2 stability conditions, the relaxation parameters and weight coefficients of the MRT-LB model can be automatically given by a simple computer code. Finally, we perform numerical simulations of several benchmark problems, and find that the numerical results can achieve a fourth-order convergence rate, which is in agreement with our theoretical analysis. In particular, for the isotropic diffusion equation, we also make a comparison between the fourth-order MRT-LB models with the DdQ(2d^2+1) and DdQ(2d+1) lattice structures, and the numerical results show that the MRT-LB model with the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure is more general.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"odinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We refer to our method as cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic functions can be quantized with arbitrary precision. Crucially, our method is exact. Being free from any approximations, cascade quantization dispenses with simplifying assumptions such as the weakly-nonlinear limit, or semiclassical dynamics in the quantized system -- both of which have been critical in facilitating quantization in the literature. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over the existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Testing for Markovian character of transfer of fluctuations in solar wind turbulence on kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply statistical analysis to search for processes responsible for turbulence in physical systems. In our previous studies, we have shown that solar wind turbulence in the inertial range of large magnetohydrodynamic scales exhibits Markov properties. We have recently extended this approach on much smaller kinetic scales. Here we are testing for the Markovian character of stochastic processes in a kinetic regime based on magnetic field and velocity fluctuations in the solar wind, measured onboard the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission: behind the bow shock, inside the magnetosheath, and near the magnetopause. We have verified that the Chapman-Kolmogorov necessary conditions for Markov processes is satisfied for local transfer of energy between the magnetic and velocity fields also on kinetic scales. We have confirmed that for magnetic fluctuations, the first Kramers-Moyal coefficient is linear, while the second term is quadratic, corresponding to drift and diffusion processes in the resulting Fokker-Planck equation. It means that magnetic self-similar turbulence is described by generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We show that for the magnetic case, the Fokker-Planck equation leads to the probability density functions of the kappa distributions, which exhibit global universal scale invariance with a linear scaling and lack of intermittency. On the contrary, for velocity fluctuations, higher order Kramers-Moyal coefficients should be taken into account and hence scale invariance is not observed. However, the nonextensity parameter in Tsallis entropy provides a robust measure of the departure of the system from equilibrium. The obtained results are important for a better understanding of the physical mechanism governing turbulent systems in space and laboratory.</description>

      <title>Compactification of Anisotropies in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Specifically, we examine the simplest scenario in which the scalar field lacks a kinetic term, and its kinetic contribution arises from an integration by parts of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes, focusing on Bianchi I and extended Bianchi I geometries. Our study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetimes where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropic configurations where all scale factors evolve identically. Additionally, we discuss the effects of a cosmological constant, finding that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe.</description>

      <title>A new density limit for unanimity in majority dynamics on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majority dynamics is a process on a simple, undirected graph $G$ with an initial Red/Blue color for every vertex of $G$. Each day, each vertex updates its color following the majority among its neighbors, using its previous color for tie-breaking. The dynamics achieves \textit{unanimity} if every vertex has the same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to \textit{win}.
  When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition in terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the Red and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability arbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\Delta^2 \gg1 $, $p\Delta \geq 100$, and $p\geq (1+\varepsilon) n^{-1}\log n$ for a positive constant $\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not extremely small, namely $p &gt; \log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022) showed that the condition $p\Delta^2 \gg 1$ is sufficient.
  If $n^{-1}\log^2 n \ll p \ll n^{-1/2}\log^{1/4} n$, we show that $p^{3/2}\Delta \gg n^{-1/2}\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if $p\Delta \geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and Vu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition for $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at random among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower bound $p \gg n^{-2/3}\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of $n^{-3/5}\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T. Tran (2021).</description>

Abstract: We study the following Liouville system defined on a flat torus \begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big),\nonumber
  u_j\in H_{per}^1(\Omega)\mbox{ for }i\in I=\{1,\cdots,n\}\nonumber,

  \right. \end{equation} where $h_j\in C^3(\Omega)$, $h_j&gt;0$, $\rho_j&gt;0$ and $u=(u_1,..,u_n)$ is doubly periodic on $\partial\Omega$. The matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ satisfies certain properties. One central problem about Liouville systems is whether multi-bubble solutions do exist. In this work we present a comprehensive construction of multi-bubble solutions in the most general setting.</description>

      <title>Concentration via Metastable Mixing, with Applications to the Supercritical Exponential Random Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a folklore belief that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We prove a rigorous version of this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. To do this, we first present a new general result deriving concentration inequalities in a metastable well from the metastable mixing of a Markov chain with the appropriate stationary distribution, extending a result of Chatterjee [Cha05] which is suited for more traditional forms of global mixing. We then apply this result to the supercritical (low-temperature) ERGM which was recently proven to exhibit metastable mixing by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani [BNN24], and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the supercritical ERGM conditioned on a large metastable well, answering a question posed by [BNN24]. This extends a result of Ganguly and Nam [GN24] from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to a metastable well in the supercritical regime, and we are also able to extend the applications of their concentration inequality to these metastable wells. Namely, we obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the count of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we also discuss the results of what appears to be the first simulation study of a metastable well in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop methods for systematic construction of superintegrable polynomials in matrix/eigenvalue models. Our consideration is based on a tight connection of superintegrable property of Gaussian Hermitian model and $W_{1 + \infty}$ algebra in Fock representation. Motivated by this example, we propose a set of assumptions that may allow one to recover superintegrable polynomials. The main two assumptions are box adding/removing rule (Pierri rule) and existence of Hamiltonian for superintegrable polynomials. We detail our method in case of the Gaussian Hermitian model, and then apply it to the cubic Kontsevich model.</description>

Abstract: The triad refers to embedding of two systems of polynomials, symmetric ones and those of the Baker-Akhiezer type into a power series of the Noumi-Shiraishi type. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory and its extensions. The basic triad is associated with the vector representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. We discuss lifting this triad to two elliptic generalizations and further to the bi-elliptic triad. At the algebraic level, it corresponds to elliptic and bi-elliptic DIM algebras. This completes the list of polynomials associated with Seiberg-Witten theory with adjoint matter in various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Two-Dimensional Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a random band matrix $H=(H_{xy})_{x,y}$ of dimension $N\times N$ with mean-zero complex Gaussian entries, where $x,y$ belong to the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z}/\sqrt{N}\mathbb{Z})^{2}$. The variance profile $\mathbb{E}|H_{xy}|^{2}=S_{xy}$ vanishes when the distance between $x,y$ is larger than some band-width parameter $W$ depending on $N$.
  We show that if the band-width satisfies $W\geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$ for some $\mathfrak{c}&gt;0$, then in the large-$N$ limit, we have the following results. The first result is a local semicircle law in the bulk down to scales $N^{-1+\varepsilon}$. The second is delocalization of bulk eigenvectors. The third is a quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors. The fourth is universality of local bulk eigenvalue statistics. The fifth is a quantum diffusion profile for the associated $T$ matrix.
  Our method is based on embedding $H$ inside a matrix Brownian motion $H_{t}$ as done in [Dubova-Yang '24] and [Yau-Yin '25] for band matrices on the one-dimensional torus. In this paper, the key additional ingredient in our analysis of $H_{t}$ is a new CLT-type estimate for polynomials in the entries of the resolvent of $H_{t}$.</description>

      <title>Global Minimality in Constrained Inverse Source Problems for Complex Electromagnetic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.00582v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global minimality, boundedness, and uniqueness are established for a general, physically motivated class of inverse source problems in non-homogeneous electromagnetic media with generalized constitutive parameters. The existence of a solution was addressed earlier. The radiating source, represented by the current density, was reconstructed earlier by minimizing its $L^{2}$-norm constrained to produce a prescribed radiated field while ensuring vanishing reactive power. Using the $L^{2}$-norm allows for an analytically tractable measure of the physical resources of the source, while the reactive power constraint maximizes transmitted power. Numerical study suggests that sources within active metamaterial substrates can have remarkable tuning behaviors. Tuning stability can be achieved along specific permittivity and permeability curves on zero-reactive power plots. Each permittivity or permeability value can correspond to a discrete set of dual parameter values that enable effective tuning. The tuning characteristics observed suggest that double-positive (DPS) and double-negative (DNG) substrates are more favorable for tuning than single-negative (SNG) materials, possibly due to interactions dominant in DPS and DNG media.</description>

      <title>Edge states in super honeycomb structures with PT-symmetric deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of edge states is one of the most vital properties of topological insulators. Although tremendous success has been accomplished in describing and explaining edge states associated with PT symmetry breaking, little work has been done on PT symmetry preserving cases. Two-dimensional Schroedinger operators with super honeycomb lattice potentials always have double Dirac cones at the Gamma point - the zero momentum point on their energy bands due to C6 symmetry, PT symmetry, and the "folding" symmetry - caused by an additional translation symmetry. There are two topologically different ways to deform such a system by PT symmetry preserving but folding symmetry breaking perturbations. Interestingly, there exist two gapped edge states on the interface between such two kinds of perturbed materials. In this paper, we illustrate the existence of such PT preserving edge states rigorously for the first time. We use a domain wall modulated Schroedinger operator to model the phenomenon under small perturbations and rigorously prove the existence of two gapped edge states. We also provide a brief interpretation from the point of view of "topology" by the parities of degenerate bulk modes. Our work thoroughly explains the existence of "helical" like edge states in super honeycomb configurations and lays a foundation for the descriptions of topologies of such systems.</description>

      <title>Species of structure and physical dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the often underestimated importance of physical dimensions and units in the formal reconstruction of physical theories, focusing on structuralist approaches that use the concept of ``species of structure" as a meta-mathematical tool. Similar approaches also play a role in current philosophical debates on the metaphysical status of physical quantities. Our approach builds on an earlier proposal by Terence Tao. It involves the representation of fundamental physical quantities by one-dimensional real ordered vector spaces, while derived quantities are formulated using concepts from linear algebra, e.g. tensor products and dual spaces. As an introduction, the theory of Ohm's law is considered. We then formulate a reconstruction of the calculus of physical dimensions, including Buckingham's $\Pi$-theorem. Furthermore, an application of this method to the Newtonian theory of gravitating systems consisting of point particles is demonstrated, emphasizing the role of the automorphism group and its physical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable Schr\"odinger operators related to the confluent equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our paper investigates one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators defined as closed operators on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ or $L^2(\mathbb{R}_+)$ that are exactly solvable in terms of confluent functions (or, equivalently, Whittaker functions). We allow the potentials to be complex. They fall into three families: Whittaker operators (or radial Coulomb Hamiltonians), Schr\"odinger operators with Morse potentials and isotonic oscillators. For each of them, we discuss the corresponding basic holomorphic family of closed operators and the integral kernel of their resolvents. We also describe transmutation identities that relate these resolvents. These identities interchange spectral parameters with coupling constants across different operator families.
  A similar analysis is performed for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators solvable in terms of Bessel functions (which are reducible to special cases of Whittaker functions). They fall into two families: Bessel operators and Schr\"odinger operators with exponential potentials.
  To make our presentation self-contained, we include a short summary of the theory of closed one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with singular boundary conditions. We also provide a concise review of special functions that we use.</description>

      <title>Symplectic (Non-)Invariance of the Free Energy in Topological Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F_g$ be the free energy derived from Topological Recursion for a given spectral curve on a compact Riemann surface, and let $F_g^\vee$ be its $x$-$y$ dual, that is, the free energy derived from the same spectral curve with the roles of $x$ and $y$ interchanged. $F_g$ is sometimes called a symplectic invariant due to its invariance under certain symplectomorphisms of the formal symplectic form $dx\wedge dy$. However, the free energy is not generally invariant under the swap of $x$ and $y$; thus, the difference $F_g - F_g^\vee$ is nonzero.
  We derive a new formula for this difference for all $g\geq 2$ in terms of a residue calculation at the singularities of $x$ and $y$, including cases where $x$ and $y$ have logarithmic singularities. For the derivation, we apply recent developments from $x$-$y$ duality within the theory of (Logarithmic) Topological Recursion. The derived formulas are particularly useful for spectral curves with a trivial $x$-$y$ dual side, meaning those with vanishing $F_g^\vee$. In such cases, one obtains an explicit result for $F_{g\geq 2}$ itself.
  We apply this to several classes of spectral curves and prove, for instance, a recent conjecture by Borot et al. that the free energies $F_g$ computed by Topological Recursion for the "Gaiotto curve" coincide with the perturbative part (in the $\Omega$-background) of the Nekrasov partition function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory. Similar computations also provide $F_g$ for the CDO curve related to Hurwitz numbers, or the negative $r$-spin curve related to $\Theta$-class intersection numbers on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$.</description>

      <title>Micro-local analysis of contact Anosov flows and band structure of the Ruelle spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometrical micro-local analysis of contact Anosov flow, such as geodesic flow on negatively curved manifold. This micro-local analysis is based on wave-packet transform discussed in arXiv:1706.09307. The main result is that the transfer operator is well approximated (in the high frequency limit) by the quantization of the Hamiltonian flow naturally defined from the contact Anosov flow and extended to some vector bundle over the symplectization set. This gives a few important consequences: the discrete eigenvalues of the generator of transfer operators, called Ruelle spectrum, are structured into vertical bands. If the right-most band is isolated from the others, most of the Ruelle spectrum in it concentrate along a line parallel to the imaginary axis and, further, the density satisfies a Weyl law as the imaginary part tend to infinity. Some of these results were announced in arXiv:1301.5525.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supermaps are Characterized by Locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new characterisation of quantum supermaps in terms of an axiom that refers only to sequential and parallel composition. Consequently, we generalize quantum supermaps to arbitrary monoidal categories and operational probabilistic theories. We do so by providing a simple definition of locally-applicable transformation on a monoidal category. The definition can be rephrased in the language of category theory using the principle of naturality, and can be given an intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of which all proofs are presented. In our main technical contribution, we use this diagrammatic representation to show that locally-applicable transformations on quantum channels are in one-to-one correspondence with deterministic quantum supermaps. This alternative characterization of quantum supermaps is proven to work for more general multiple-input supermaps such as the quantum switch and on arbitrary normal convex spaces of quantum channels such as those defined by satisfaction of signaling constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set the criteria under which superposition of causal order can be incorporated in to quantum walks. In particular, we show that only periodic quantum walks or those with at least one disorder exhibit Superposition of causal order under the action of `quantum switch'. We exemplify our results with a simple example of two-period discrete-time quantum walks. In particular, we observe that periodic quantum walks exhibit causal asymmetry pertaining to the dynamics of the reduced coin state: the dynamics are more non-Markovian for one temporal order than the other. We also note that the non-Markovianity of the reduced coin state due to indefiniteness in causal order tends to match the dynamics of a particular temporal order of the coin state. We substantiate our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the first relationship between Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) phase, which corresponds to central charge values $\mathbf c_{\mathrm L} \in (1,25)$ or equivalently to complex values of $\gamma$ with $|\gamma|=2$. More precisely, we introduce a canonical supercritical LQG surface with the topology of the disk. We then show that for each $\mathbf c_{\mathrm L} \in (1,25)$ there is a coupling of this LQG surface with a conformal loop ensemble with parameter $\kappa=4$ (CLE$_4$) wherein the LQG surfaces parametrized by the regions enclosed by the CLE$_4$ loops are conditionally independent supercritical LQG disks given their boundary lengths. In this coupling, the CLE$_4$ is neither determined by nor independent from the LQG. Guided by our coupling result, we exhibit a combinatorially natural family of loop-decorated random planar maps whose scaling limit we conjecture to be the supercritical LQG disk coupled to CLE$_4$. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Algebraic geometry of the multilayer model of the fractional quantum Hall effect on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1993 Keski-Vakkuri and Wen introduced a model for the fractional quantum Hall effect based on multilayer two-dimensional electron systems satisfying quasi-periodic boundary conditions. Such a model is essentially specified by a choice of a complex torus $E$ and a symmetric positively definite matrix $K$ of size $g$ with positive integral coefficients.
  The space of the corresponding wave functions turns out to be $\delta$-dimensional, where $\delta$ is the determinant of $K$. We construct a hermitian holomorphic bundle of rank $\delta$ on the abelian variety $A$ (which is the $g$-fold product of the torus $E$ with itself), whose fibres can be identified with the space of wave function of Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. A rigorous construction of this "magnetic bundle" involves the technique of Fourier-Mukai transforms on abelian varieties. This bundle turns out to be simple and semi-homogeneous. This bundle can be equipped with two different (and natural) hermitian metrics: the one coming from the center-of-mass dynamics and the one coming from the Hilbert space of the underlying many-body system. We prove that the canonical Bott-Chern connection of the first hermitian metric is always projectively flat and give sufficient conditions for this property for the second hermitian metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the quantum Rabi model is obtained by replacing the linear (dipole) coupling between the two-level system and the radiation mode by a non-linear expression in the creation and annihilation operators, corresponding to multi-photon excitations. If each spin flip involves $k$ photons, it is called the "$k$-photon" quantum Rabi model. While the formally symmetric Hamilton operator is self-adjoint in the case $k=2$, it is demonstrated here that the Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint for $k\ge 3$. Therefore it does not generate a unitary time evolution and is unphysical. This result cannot be obtained by numerical calculations in finite-dimensional spaces which attempt to approximate an unbounded operator by a finite-rank operator.</description>

      <title>Higgs branch RG-flows via Decay and Fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic quivers have been an instrumental technique for advancing our understanding of Higgs branches of supersymmetric theories with 8 supercharges. In this work, we present the decay and fission algorithm for unitary magnetic quivers. It enables the derivation of the complete phase (Hasse) diagram and is characterised by the following key attributes: First and foremost, the algorithm is inherently simple; just relying on convex linear algebra. Second, any magnetic quiver can only undergo decay or fission processes; these reflect the possible Higgs branch RG-flows (Higgsings), and the quivers thereby generated are the magnetic quivers of the new RG fixed points. Third, the geometry of the decay or fission transition (i.e. the transverse slice) is simply read off. As a consequence, the algorithm does not rely on a complete list of minimal transitions, but rather outputs the transverse slice geometry automatically. As a proof of concept, its efficacy is showcased across various scenarios, encompassing SCFTs from dimensions 3 to 6, instanton moduli spaces, and little string theories.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

      <title>Strong-weak symmetry and quantum modularity of resurgent topological strings on local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantizing the mirror curve to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold gives rise to quantum operators whose fermionic spectral traces produce factorially divergent formal power series in the Planck constant and its inverse. These are conjecturally captured by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili and standard topological string free energies, respectively, via the TS/ST correspondence. The resurgent structures of the first fermionic spectral trace of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ in both weak and strong coupling limits were solved exactly by the second author in [1]. Here, we argue that a full-fledged strong-weak resurgent symmetry is at play, exchanging the perturbative/non-perturbative contributions to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic blocks in the factorization of the spectral trace. This relies on a global net of relations connecting the perturbative series and the discontinuities in the dual regimes, which is built upon the analytic properties of the $L$-functions with coefficients given by the Stokes constants and the $q$-series acting as their generating functions. Then, we show that the latter are holomorphic quantum modular forms for $\Gamma_1(3)$ and are reconstructed by the median resummation of their asymptotic expansions.</description>

      <title>Computable entanglement cost under positive partial transpose operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information theory is plagued by the problem of regularisations, which require the evaluation of formidable asymptotic quantities. This makes it computationally intractable to gain a precise quantitative understanding of the ultimate efficiency of key operational tasks such as entanglement manipulation. Here we consider the problem of computing the asymptotic entanglement cost of preparing noisy quantum states under quantum operations with positive partial transpose (PPT). By means of an analytical example, a previously claimed solution to this problem is shown to be incorrect. Building on a previous characterisation of the PPT entanglement cost in terms of a regularised formula, we construct instead a hierarchy of semi-definite programs that bypasses the issue of regularisation altogether, and converges to the true asymptotic value of the entanglement cost. Our main result establishes that this convergence happens exponentially fast, thus yielding an efficient algorithm that approximates the cost up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(D,\,\log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $D$ is the underlying Hilbert space dimension. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an asymptotic entanglement measure is shown to be efficiently computable despite no closed-form formula being available.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Leading correction to the relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Dirac particles interacting with external fields, we use the exact operator of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation obtained by Eriksen and rigorously derive a leading correction in the weak-field approximation to the known relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we carry out the operator extraction of a square root in the Eriksen operator. The derived correction is important for the scattering of relativistic particles. Since the description of this scattering by a relativistic wave equation of the second order is more convenient, we determine a general connection between relativistic wave equations of the first and second orders. For Dirac particles, the relativistic wave equation of the second order is obtained with a correction similar to that to the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A geometrical Green-Naghdi type system for dispersive-like waves in prismatic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 2D free surface gravity waves in prismatic channels with bathymetric variations uniquely in the transverse direction. Starting from the Saint-Venant equations (shallow water equations) we derive a 1D transverse averaged model describing dispersive effects solely related to variations of the channel topography. These effects have been demonstrated in Chassagne et al. JFM 2019 to be predominant in the propagation of bores with Froude numbers below a critical value of about 1.15. The model proposed is fully nonlinear, Galilean invariant, and admits a variational formulation under natural assumptions about the channel geometry. It is endowed with an exact energy conservation law, and admits exact travelling wave solutions. Our model generalizes and improves the linear equations proposed by Chassagne et al. JFM 2019, as well as Quezada de Luna and Ketcheson JFM 2021. The system is recast in two useful forms appropriate for its numerical approximations, whose properties are discussed. Numerical results allow to verify against analytical solutions the implementation of these formulations, and validate our model against fully 2D nonlinear shallow water simulations, as well as the famous experiments by Treske J. Hyd. Res. 1994.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection between tasep-like interacting particle systems and last passage percolation type polymer models, focusing on three models: Geometric, Exponential and Brownian last passage percolation and their associated tasep particle systems. We explain how formulas for certain natural observables in last passage percolation translate to formulas for tasep, by going through a notion of "duality". In turn, we obtain determinantal formulas for last passage percolation with a deterministic boundary and for tasep with a deterministic first particle trajectory.</description>

Abstract: An infinite number of solvable Hamiltonians, including the transverse Ising chain, the XY chain with an external field, the cluster model with next-nearest-neighbor x-x interactions, or with next-nearest-neighbor z-z interactions, and other solvable models that can be mapped to the free fermion system are considered. All the conserved charges of these models written by the string-type products of the interactions are obtained. In the case of the transverse Ising chain, all the known charges are rederived, and in the case of the other models, new conserved charges are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the Z2-graded Hopf algebras. To present the constructions, we consider in detail the Borel half of Uq(sl(2)) and two super Hopf algebra examples: the Borel half of Uq(osp(1|2)) and the Borel half of Uq(gl(1|1)) for q being a root of unity. We prove the isomorphism between the Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras, which is missing in the literature, and extend the isomorphism to the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the Z2-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory [1, 2], as well as illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the full Uq(gl(1|1)) Hopf algebra. In addition, we generalise an isomorphism between the Drinfeld double and the loop algebra from the combinatorial quantisation to the graded setting.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in a one-dimensional effective quantum-electrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of progressing toward a practical implementation of an effective quantum-electrodynamics (QED) theory of atoms and molecules, which includes the effects of vacuum polarization through the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs but without the explicit photon degrees of freedom, we study a one-dimensional effective QED model of the hydrogen-like atom with delta-potential interactions. This model resembles the three-dimensional effective QED theory with Coulomb interactions while being substantially simpler. We provide some mathematical details about the definition of this model, calculate the vacuum-polarization density, and the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy, correcting and extending results of previous works. We also study the approximation of the model in a finite plane-wave basis, and in particular we discuss the basis convergence of the bound-state energy and eigenfunction, of the vacuum-polarization density, and of the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy. We highlight the difficulty of converging the vacuum-polarization density in a finite basis and we propose a way to improve it. The present work could give hints on how to perform similar calculations for the three-dimensional effective QED theory of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization and eigenvalue asymptotics: long-range hopping lattice operators with electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for polynomial long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field under any bounded perturbation, the semi-uniform polynomial decay of the eigenfunctions is determined by the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues, and conversely. Consequently, we recover and refine recent results on power-law dynamical localization for this model. In this paper, to prove these results, we develop new arguments to deal with singularities in obtaining the semi-uniform polynomial decay of eigenfunctions, prove an independent result on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for discrete operators, revisit a notion of Power-Law SULE, and utilize a known perturbation result on localization, proved through the KAM method. Unlike existing results in the literature, our approach does not rely on the specific form of the eigenfunctions, but rather the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the potential. It is worth underlining that our general results can be applied to other models such as Maryland-type potentials.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States in Field Theory: No Partial Factorization, Multi-Particle Packaging, and Hybrid Gauge-Invariant Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum field excitations can generate packaged entangled states, in which all internal quantum numbers (IQNs) (e.g., electric charge, flavor, and color) are inseparably entangled and constrained to irreducible representation (irrep) blocks. This is a consequence of local gauge invariance and superselection rules. The confinement restricts the net gauge charge to a single superselection sector, thereby excluding cross-sector superpositions but allowing entanglement within one sector. We establish theorems that: \textbf{(1)} Explain how these packaged entangled states naturally arise from quantum field excitations, \textbf{(2)} Show how they remain gauge invariant or transform covariantly within a fixed net-charge sector, and \textbf{(3)} Illustrate how external degrees of freedom (DOFs) (e.g., spin or momentum) can combine with packaged internal charges to yield gauge-invariant entanglement. Finally, we show that spin or momentum measurements on these hybrid states induce a collapse of the internal entanglement.</description>

      <title>On a coupled system of KP-type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defining characteristic of the Kadomstev-Petviashvili (KP) model equation is that the well-posedness results are subject to the restriction that at all transverse positions, the mass $\int u \,dx = \text{constant independent of $y$}.$ In 2007, for a rather general class of equations of KP type, it was shown that the zero-mass (in $x$) constraint is satisfied at any non-zero time even if it is not satisfied at initial time zero. To remedy this ``odd'' behavior, a model modification is introduced which does not impose non-physical restrictions upon the initial data. In this article, we introduce a new modified KP system, named the Non-KP model equation. After providing a variational derivation of the Non-KP model, we analyze its Hamiltonian evolutionary structure. Furthermore, we prove linear estimates in the Bourgain spaces $X^{s,b}$ corresponding to the integral equation arising from the Duhamel formulation of system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from an elementary calculation of super Lie group elements associating with non(anti)-commutative Grassmann parameters, we derive several closed expressions of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula which represent multiplication properties of super Lie group elements in the corresponding superspace. We then show that parametrization of superspace in general may become infinite dimensional due to the presence of non(anti)commutativity. We show that a Dirac-K\"ahler Twisted SUSY Algebra (also referred to as Marcus B-type Twisted SUSY Algebra or Geometric Langlands Twisted SUSY Algebra) with a certain type of deformation, which we call an exponential deformation, may circumvent this problem. We also provide, in terms of gauge covariantization of the SUSY algebra, a geometric understanding of the exponential deformation, and see that the framework constructed in this paper may serve as a non(anti)commutative superspace framework providing the gauge covariant link formulation of twisted super Yang-Mills on a lattice.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the rich structure of peakon and pseudo-peakon solutions for a class of higher-order $b$-family equations, referred to as the $J$-th $b$-family ($J$-bF) equations. We propose several conjectures concerning the weak solutions of these equations, including a $b$-independent pseudo-peakon solution, a $b$-independent peakon solution, and a $b$-dependent peakon solution. These conjectures are analytically verified for $J \leq 14$ and/or $J \leq 9$ using the computer algebra software MAPLE. The $b$-independent pseudo-peakon solution is a 3rd-order pseudo-peakon for general arbitrary constants, with higher-order pseudo-peakons derived under specific parameter constraints. Additionally, we identify both $b$-independent and $b$-dependent peakon solutions, highlighting their distinct properties and the nuanced relationship between the parameters $b$ and $J$. The existence of these solutions underscores the rich dynamical structure of the $J$-bF equations and generalizes previous results for lower-order equations. Future research directions include higher-order generalizations, rigorous proofs of the conjectures, interactions between different types of peakons and pseudo-peakons, stability analysis, and potential physical applications. These advancements significantly contribute to the understanding of peakon systems and their broader implications in mathematics and physics.</description>
