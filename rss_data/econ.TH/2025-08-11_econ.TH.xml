      <title>Inattention to States and Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the state-action rational inattention model with two dimensions of uncertainty: states and hedonic characteristics. The resulting conditional choice probability takes a familiar weighted multinomial logit form, but in contrast to the state-action model, is unique and is not a corner solution. The model imposes testable restrictions on the behavior of choice probabilities in markets with product entry.</description>

      <title>Waiting for Trade in Markets with Aggregate Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a market in which a patient long-lived seller offers prices to short-lived buyers. A hidden state determines whether the buyer's common value exceeds the seller's reservation value, and all players only have noisy signals. If the seller has commitment power, the seller waits for a buyer with the most favorable signal to arrive, and else exits the market. Using techniques for monotone decision problems, this waiting strategy is shown to be optimal for learning whether trade is efficient. Due to the interplay between the seller's and the buyers' information, the seller's decision to exit may be non-monotonic in the seller's information, and prices may be non-monotonic over time. Without commitment power, there is an equilibrium in which the seller also waits for a buyer with the most favorable signal, but the seller exits at inefficient times.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Analysis of Gains from Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a geometric proof that the random proposer mechanism is a $4$-approximation to the first-best gains from trade in bilateral exchange. We then refine this geometric analysis to recover the state-of-the-art approximation ratio of $3.15$.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Agents through Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the optimal design of ratings to motivate agent investment in quality when transfers are unavailable. The principal designs a rating scheme that maps the agent's quality to a (possibly stochastic) score. The agent has private information about his ability, which determines his cost of investment, and chooses the quality level. The market observes the score and offers a wage equal to the agent's expected quality. For example, a school incentivizes learning through a grading policy that discloses the student's quality to the job market.
  When restricted to deterministic ratings, I provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of simple pass/fail tests and lower censorship. In particular, when the principal's objective is expected quality, pass/fail tests are optimal if the agent's ability distribution is concentrated towards the top, while lower censorship is optimal if the ability distribution is concentrated towards the mode. The results also generalize existing results in optimal delegation with an outside option, as pass/fail tests (lower censorship) correspond to take-it-or-leave-it offers (threshold delegation). Additionally, I provide sufficient conditions under which stochastic ratings outperform deterministic ratings and under which they do not.</description>
