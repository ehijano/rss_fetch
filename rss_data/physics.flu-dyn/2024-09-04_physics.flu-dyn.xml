      <title>A note on the amplitude modulation phenomenon in non-canonical wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplitude modulation phenomena, defined originally by Mathis et al. (J. Fluid Mech., 628, 311-337; 2009), corresponds to a unique non-linear interaction between Reynolds number ($Re_{\tau}$) dependent large-scale motions and $Re_{\tau}$-invariant inner-scale motions observed in canonical wall-bounded flows. While similar non-linear interactions can be observed in non-canonical wall-bounded flows, linking them to amplitude modulation is questionable due to the fact that each non-canonical effect is associated with distinct variations in the energies of both the large and inner scaled motions. This study investigates non-linear triadic interactions as a function of various non-canonical effects by analyzing published hot-wire datasets acquired in the large Melbourne wind tunnel. It is found that triadic interactions, across the entire turbulence scale hierarchy, become statistically significant with increasing intensity of non-canonical effects such as rough walls, pressure gradients, and spanwise or wall-normal forcing. This stands in contrast to previous observations made in canonical flows, where only the interaction between inner scales and inertia-dominated large scales was considered dynamically significant for increasing $Re_{\tau}$. The implications of these findings are discussed for near-wall flow prediction models in non-canonical flows, which must take into account all coexisting non-linear triadic interactions in wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing unsteady flows from sparse, noisy measurements with a physics-constrained convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from fluid flow measurements are typically sparse, noisy, and heterogeneous, often from mixed pressure and velocity measurements, resulting in incomplete datasets. In this paper, we develop a physics-constrained convolutional neural network, which is a deterministic tool, to reconstruct the full flow field from incomplete data. We explore three loss functions, both from machine learning literature and newly proposed: (i) the softly-constrained loss, which allows the prediction to take any value; (ii) the snapshot-enforced loss, which constrains the prediction at the sensor locations; and (iii) the mean-enforced loss, which constrains the mean of the prediction at the sensor locations. The proposed methods do not require the full flow field during training, making it suitable for reconstruction from incomplete data. We apply the method to reconstruct a laminar wake of a bluff body and a turbulent Kolmogorov flow. First, we assume that measurements are not noisy and reconstruct both the laminar wake and the Kolmogorov flow from sensors located at fewer than 1% of all grid points. The snapshot-enforced loss reduces the reconstruction error of the Kolmogorov flow by approximately 25% compared to the softly-constrained loss. Second, we assume that measurements are noisy and propose the mean-enforced loss to reconstruct the laminar wake and the Kolmogorov flow at three different signal-to-noise ratios. We find that, across the ratios tested, the loss functions with harder constraints are more robust to both the random initialization of the networks and the noise levels in the measurements. At high noise levels, the mean-enforced loss can recover the instantaneous snapshots accurately, making it the suitable choice when reconstructing flows from data corrupted with an unknown amount of noise. The proposed method opens opportunities for physical flow reconstruction from sparse, noisy data.</description>

      <title>Modelling aerodynamic forces and torques of spheroid particles in compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we conduct numerical simulations of compressible flows around spheroid particles, for the purpose of refining empirical formulas for drag force, lift force, and pitching torque acting on them. Through an analysis of approximately a thousand numerical simulation cases spanning a wide range of Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers and particle aspect ratios, we first identify the crucial parameters that are strongly correlated with the forces and torques via Spearman correlation analysis, based on which the empirical formulas for the drag force, lift force and pitching torque coefficients are refined. The novel formulas developed for compressible flows exhibit consistency with their incompressible counterparts at low Mach number limits and, moreover, yield accurate predictions with average relative errors of less than 5%. This underscores their robustness and reliability in predicting aerodynamic loads on spheroidal particles under various flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Freezing receding contact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the receding of a contact line when a Peltier module is pulled out of a water bath at constant speed, while a ice layer is also growing at constant speed on the Peltier module. A steady regime is therefore reached for all the parameters used in this studied, corresponding to a dynamical stationnary meniscus. We show that the height of the meniscus provides most of the properties of the flow. For high pulling rate, it is related to the amount of liquid of the equivalent Landau-Levich (LL) film that would be extracted from the bath, which is eventually freezing as the plate is lifted upward. For smaller velocity, so that no LL film would be formed without freezing, the meniscus height is directly linked to the contact angle of water on ice in these conditions. Solving numerically the meniscus equation taking into account the solidifcation of water, our results suggest that the contact angle of water on ice should be around $6^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Inertial Particle Dynamics in Traveling Wave Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of inertial particles in fluid flows have been the focus of extensive research due to their relevance in a wide range of industrial and environmental processes. Earlier studies have examined the dynamics of aerosols and bubbles using the Maxey-Riley equation in some standard systems but their dynamics within the traveling wave flow remain unexplored. In this paper, we study the Lagrangian dynamics of inertial particles in the traveling wave flow which shows mixing, and segregation in phase space as well as the formation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). We first obtain the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLEs) for the base fluid flow defined by the traveling wave flow using the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. Further, we extend our calculations to the inertial particles to get the inertial finite-time Lyapunov exponent (iFTLEs). Our findings reveal that heavier inertial particles tend to be attracted to the ridges of the FTLE fields, while lighter particles are repelled. By understanding how material elements in a flow separate and stretch, one can predict pollutant dispersion, optimize the mixing process, and improve navigation and tracking in fluid environments. This provides insights into the complex and non-intuitive behavior of inertial particles in chaotic fluid flows, and may have implications for pollutant transport in wide-ranging fields such as atmospheric and oceanic sciences.</description>

      <title>Electrolyte spraying within H$_2$ bubbles during water electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrolytically generated gas bubbles can significantly hamper the overall electrolysis efficiency. Therefore it is crucial to understand their dynamics in order to optimise water electrolyzer systems. Here we demonstrate a distinct transport mechanism where coalescence with microbubbles drives electrolyte droplets, resulting from the fragmentation of the Worthington jet, into the gas phase during hydrogen evolution reaction, both in normal and microgravity environments. This indicates that the H$_2$ bubble is not only composed of hydrogen gas and vapor but also includes electrolyte fractions. Reminiscent of bursting bubbles on a liquid-gas interface, this behavior results in a flow inside the bubble, which is further affected by Marangoni convection at the gas-electrolyte interface, highlighting interface mobility. In the case of electrode-attached bubbles, the sprayed droplets form electrolyte puddles at the bubble-electrode contact area, affecting the dynamics near the three-phase contact line and favoring bubble detachment from the electrode. The results of this work unravel important insights into the physicochemical aspects of electrolytic gas bubbles, integral for optimizing gas-evolving electrochemical systems. Besides, our findings are essential for studying the limits of jet formation and rupture relevant to acid mist formation in electrowinning, generation of sea spray aerosols, impact of droplets on liquid surfaces, etc.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of two boundary layers with the same pressure distribution but different surface curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of Direct Numerical Simulations is used to investigate curvature and pressure effects. One has a Gaussian test bump and a straight opposite wall, while the other has a straight test wall and a blowing/suction distribution on an opposite porous boundary, adjusted to produce the same pressure distribution. The calculation of the transpiration distribution is made in potential flow, ignoring the boundary layer. This problem of specifying a pressure distribution is known to be ill-posed for short waves. We address this issue by considering a pressure distribution that is very smooth compared with the distance from wall to opposite boundary. It is also ill-posed once separation occurs. The pressure distribution of the viscous flow nevertheless ended up very close to the specified one, upstream of separation, and comparisons are confined to that region. In the entry region the boundary layers have essentially the same thicknesses and are well-developed turbulence-wise, which is essential for a valid comparison. The focus is on the attached flow in the favorable and adverse gradients. The convex curvature is strong enough compared with the boundary-layer thickness to make the strain-rate tensor drop to near zero over the top of the bump. An intense internal layer forms in the favorable gradient, an order of magnitude thinner than the incoming boundary layer. The effect of curvature follows expectations: concave curvature moderately raises the skin friction, although without creating Gortler vortices, and convex curvature reduces it. The pressure gradient still dominates the physics. Common turbulence models unfortunately over-predict the skin friction in both flows near its peak, and under-predict the curvature effect even when curvature corrections are included.</description>

      <title>Continuous generation of confined bubbles: viscous effect on the gravito-capillary pinch off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous liquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously generated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts like an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating bubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the period of the bubble formation and the size of bubbles as a function of the amount of air under the gate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we successfully identified in a clear manner that the dynamics of the bubble formation is governed by dissipation in thin films whose thickness is determined by Derjaguin's law balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy, after examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, demonstrating the potential of scaling analysis even in extremely complex cases. Furthermore, we uncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the size of the bubble created: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role beyond the conventional mechanism of Tate in which gravity competes with capillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds number. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advance our knowledge of bubble generation and bubble pinch-off in a clear manner with the results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In particular, the present study demonstrates a new avenue in microfluidics for understanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the characters of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>A revisit of the development of viscoplastic flow in pipes and channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study revisits the development of viscoplastic flow in pipes and channels, focusing on the flow of a Bingham plastic. Using finite element simulations and the Papanastasiou regularisation, results are obtained across a range of Reynolds and Bingham numbers. The novel contributions of this work include: (a) investigating a definition of the development length based on wall shear stress, a critical parameter in numerous applications; (b) considering alternative definitions of the Reynolds number in an effort to collapse the development length curves into a single master curve, independent of the Bingham number; (c) examining the patterns of yielded and unyielded regions within the flow domain; and (d) assessing the impact of the regularisation parameter on the accuracy of the results. The findings enhance the existing literature, providing a more comprehensive understanding of this classic flow problem.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for the sound generation of bio-inspired flapping wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired flapping wings have been extensively studied for their remarkable aerodynamic performance. Recently, their noise emission has attracted growing interest, but a careful analysis of scaling laws for their sound generation is missing. This work presents scaling laws for the sound generation of bio-inspired flapping wings during hovering flight based on the potential flow theory and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy. Direct numerical simulations considering a range of parameters including the Reynolds number, Mach number and wing kinematics confirms that the proposed scaling laws capture the major physics involved and their predictions agree well with the numerical results. The scaling laws can be used as a powerful tool for engineers in the design of micro-aerial vehicles considering both aerodynamics and acoustics performances simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Flux scaling in Rayleigh B\'enard convection: a local boundary layer analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of shear due to the large scale flow (LSF) on the heat flux in Rayleigh B'enard convection for a range of near-plate Rayleigh numbers $8\times 10^7 \leq Ra_w \leq 5\times 10^{14}$, by studying its effect on the local boundary layers (BLs) on either sides of the plumes, which are much thinner than the global shear BL created by the LSF velocity $V_F$. Considering these local BLs forced externally by the LSF, we obtain a fifth order algebraic equation for the local boundary layer thicknesses. Solving these equations numerically using $Re$ relations for aspect ratios $\Gamma=1$ and 0.5, we obtain the variation of the local BL thicknesses with the longitudinal distance for various $Ra_w$. We find that the average shear acting on the edges of these local BLs ($\overline{u|}_{z=\delta}$) increases as $\overline{u|}_{z=\delta} \sim Ra_w^{1/3}$ for $8\times 10^7\leq Ra_w \leq 10^{12}$ at $\Gamma=1$, and as $\overline{u|}_{z=\delta} \sim Ra_w^{0.38}$ for $1\times 10^{11}\leq Ra_w \leq 5\times 10^{14}$ at $\Gamma=0.5$. We then estimate the average local thermal BL thickness to find the global Nusselt number $Nu$.We find that $Nu\sim Ra_w^m$, where $m\approx 0.327$ for $8\times 10^7 \leq Ra_w \leq 1\times 10^{12}$ at $\Gamma=1$, and $m=0.33$ for $1\times10^{11}\leq Ra_w \leq 5\times10^{14}$ at $\Gamma=0.5$. Inspite of the increasing shear on these BLs with increasing $Ra_w$, we then surprisingly obtain the classical 1/3 scaling of flux since the shear forcing acting on those BLs remains sub-dominant compared to the NCBL velocities ($V_{bl}$) within these BLs, upto $Ra_w\leq 5\times10^{14}$.</description>

      <title>A wall model for separated flows: embedded learning to improve a posteriori performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of a wall model using machine learning methods for the large-eddy simulation (LES) of separated flows is still an unsolved problem. Our approach is to leverage the significance of separated flow data, for which existing theories are not applicable, and the existing knowledge of wall-bounded flows (such as the law of the wall) along with embedded learning to address this issue. The proposed so-called features-embedded-learning (FEL) wall model comprises two submodels: one for predicting the wall shear stress and another for calculating the eddy viscosity at the first off-wall grid nodes. We train the former using the wall-resolved LES data of the periodic hill flow and the law of the wall. For the latter, we propose a modified mixing length model, with the model coefficient trained using the ensemble Kalman method. The proposed FEL model is assessed using the separated flows with different flow configurations, grid resolutions, and Reynolds numbers. Overall good a posteriori performance is observed for predicting the statistics of the recirculation bubble, wall stresses, and turbulence characteristics. The statistics of the modelled subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses at the first off-wall grids are compared with those calculated using the wall-resolved LES data. The comparison shows that the amplitude and distribution of the SGS stresses obtained using the proposed model agree better with the reference data when compared with the conventional wall model.</description>

      <title>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. The shape of the equivalent effective particle is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive mesh refinement algorithm for CESE schemes on quadrilateral meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents constructions of the space-time Conservation Element and Solution Element (CESE) methods to accommodate adaptive unstructured quadrilateral meshes. Subsequently, a novel algorithm is devised to effectively manage the mesh adaptation process for staggered schemes, leveraging a unique cell-tree-vertex data structure that expedites the construction of conservation elements and simplifies the interconnection among computational cells. The integration of second-order a-{\alpha}, Courant number-insensitive, and upwind CESE schemes with this adaptation algorithm is demonstrated. Numerical simulations focusing on compressible inviscid flows are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the extended schemes and the adaptation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Wall Shear Stress Measurement using Event-based 3D Particle Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the implementation of a 3d Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) system based on event-based vision (EBV) and demonstrate its application for the near-wall characterization of a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) in air. The viscous sublayer of the TBL is illuminated by a thin light sheet that grazes the surface of a thin glass window inserted into the wind tunnel wall. The data simultaneously captured by three synchronized event-cameras is used to reconstruct the 3d particle tracks within 400 $\mu$m of the wall on a field of view of 12.0 mm x 7.5 mm. The velocity and position of particles within the viscous sublayer permit the estimation of the local vector of the unsteady wall shear stress (WSS) under the assumption of linearity between particle velocity and WSS. Thereby, time-evolving maps of the unsteady WSS and higher order statistics are obtained that are in agreement with DNS data at matching Reynolds number. Near-wall particle acceleration provide the rate of change of the WSS which exhibits fully symmetric log-normal superstatistics. Two-point correlations of the randomly spaced WSS data are obtained by a bin-averaging approach and reveal information on the spacing of near-wall streaks. The employed compact EBV hardware coupled with suited LPT tracking algorithms provide data quality on par with currently used, considerably more expensive, high-speed framing cameras.</description>

      <title>Capillary-driven migration of droplets on conical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A droplet placed on a hydrophilic conical fiber tends to move toward the end of larger radii due to capillary action. Experimental investigations are performed to explore the dynamics of droplets with varying viscosities and volumes on different fibers at the microscale. Droplets are found to accelerate initially and subsequently decelerate during migration. A dynamic model is developed to capture dynamics of the droplet migration, addressing the limitations of previous equilibrium-based scaling laws. Both experimental results and theoretical predictions indicate that droplets on more divergent fibers experience a longer acceleration phase. Additionally, gravitational effects are pronounced on fibers with small cone angles, exerting a substantial influence on droplet migration even below the capillary scale. Moreover, droplets move more slowly on dry fibers compared to those prewetted with the same liquid, primarily attributed to the increased friction. The experiments reveal the formation of a residual liquid film after droplet migration on dry fibers, leading to considerable volume loss in the droplets. To encompass the intricacies of migration on dry fibers, the model is refined to incorporate a higher friction coefficient and variable droplet volumes, providing a more comprehensive depiction of the underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Effects of fetch length on turbulent boundary layer recovery past a step-change in surface roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies focusing on the response of turbulent boundary layers (TBL) to a step-change in roughness have provided insight into the scaling and characterisation of TBLs and the development of the internal layer. Although various step-change combinations have been investigated, ranging from smooth-to-rough to rough-to-smooth, the "minimum" required roughness fetch length over which the TBL returns to its homogeneously rough behaviour remains unclear. Moreover, the relationship between a finite- and infinite-fetch roughness function (and the equivalent sandgrain roughness) is also unknown. In this study, we determine the minimum "equilibrium fetch length" for TBL developing over a smooth-to-rough step-change as well as the expected error in local skin friction if the fetch length is under this minimum threshold. An experimental study is carried out where the flow is initially developed over a smooth wall, and then a step-change is introduced using patches of P24 sandpaper. 12 roughness fetch lengths are tested in this study, systematically increasing from $L = 1\delta_2$ up to $L = 39\delta_2$ (where \textit{L} is the roughness fetch length and $\delta_2$ is the TBL thickness of the longest fetch case), measured over a range of Reynolds numbers ($4\cdot10^2 \leq Re_\tau \leq 2\cdot10^5$). Results show that the minimum fetch length needed to achieve full equilibrium recovery is around $20\delta_2$. Furthermore, we observe that $C_f$ recovers to within 10\% of its recovered value for fetch lengths $\geq 5\delta_2$. This information allows us to incorporate the effects of roughness fetch length on the skin friction and roughness function.</description>

      <title>A dispersive effective equation for transverse propagation of planar shallow water waves over periodic bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves propagating over bathymetry that varies periodically in one direction and is constant in the other. Plane waves traveling along the constant direction are known to evolve into solitary waves, due to an effective dispersion. We apply multiple-scale perturbation theory to derive an effective constant-coefficient system of Boussinesq-type equations that not only accurately describe these waves but also predict their full two-dimensional shape in some detail. Numerical experiments confirm the good agreement between the effective equations and the variable-bathymetry shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Aware Diffusion Models with Cross-Attention for Global Field Reconstruction with Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have gained attention for their ability to represent complex distributions and incorporate uncertainty, making them ideal for robust predictions in the presence of noisy or incomplete data. In this study, we develop and enhance score-based diffusion models in field reconstruction tasks, where the goal is to estimate complete spatial fields from partial observations. We introduce a condition encoding approach to construct a tractable mapping mapping between observed and unobserved regions using a learnable integration of sparse observations and interpolated fields as an inductive bias. With refined sensing representations and an unraveled temporal dimension, our method can handle arbitrary moving sensors and effectively reconstruct fields. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of our approach against a deterministic interpolation-based method across various static and time-dependent PDEs. Our study attempts to addresses the gap in strong baselines for evaluating performance across varying sampling hyperparameters, noise levels, and conditioning methods. Our results show that diffusion models with cross-attention and the proposed conditional encoding generally outperform other methods under noisy conditions, although the deterministic method excels with noiseless data. Additionally, both the diffusion models and the deterministic method surpass the numerical approach in accuracy and computational cost for the steady problem. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to capture possible reconstructions and improve the accuracy of fused results in covariance-based correction tasks using ensemble sampling.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic frictional behavior in the lubricated sliding of soft patterned surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lubricated contact of sliding soft surfaces that are locally patterned but globally cylindrical, held together under an external normal force. The local patterns represent either naturally occurring surface roughness or engineered surface textures. Three dimensionless parameters govern the system: a speed, and the amplitude and wavelength of the pattern. Using numerical solutions of the Reynolds lubrication equation, we investigate the effects of these dimensionless parameters on key variables such as contact pressure and the coefficient of friction of the lubricated system. For small roughness amplitudes, the coefficient of friction increases with roughness. However, our findings reveal that increasing surface roughness beyond a critical value can decrease the friction coefficient, a result that contradicts conventional intuition and classical studies on the lubrication of rigid surfaces. For very large roughness amplitudes, we show that the coefficient of friction drops even below the corresponding smooth case. We support these observations with a combination of perturbation theory and physical arguments, identifying scaling laws for large and small speeds, and for large and small roughness amplitudes. This study provides a quantitative understanding of friction in the contact of soft, wet objects and lays theoretical foundations for incorporating the friction coefficient into haptic feedback systems in soft robotics and haptic engineering.</description>

Abstract: Galerkin reduced order models (ROMs), e.g., based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) or reduced basis methods, have achieved significant success in the numerical simulation of fluid flows. The ROM numerical analysis, however, is still being developed. In this paper, we take a step in this direction and present a survey of a priori error bounds, with a particular focus on POD-based ROMs. Specifically, we outline the main components of ROM a priori error bounds, emphasize their practical importance, and discuss significant contributions to a priori error bounds for ROMs for fluids.</description>

      <title>Single MRT-featured Lattice Boltzmann Method (SmrtLBM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel single MRT-featured lattice Boltzmann method (SmrtLBM) is introduced. The intricate algorithm of the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator is reimagined and distilled into a streamlined, single-relaxation-time-like scheme. This innovation preserves the simplicity and efficiency of the conventional single-relaxation-time approach while inheriting the enhanced stability characteristic of the MRT techniques, making it a powerful tool for simulating complex fluid flows. Rigorous numerical testing on cavity flows demonstrates that SmrtLBM accurately captures complex flow characteristics, even in challenging high Reynolds number regimes where precision and stability are crucial. Compared to the traditional single-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method, this model offers superior stability and accurate solutions for difficult flows. The SmrtLBM marks a breakthrough in complex fluid simulation through a simple method, offering a new level of efficiency and reliability in tackling challenging flow problems.</description>

      <title>Solute-mediated colloidal vortex in a microfluidic T-junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solute gradients next to an interface drive a diffusioosmotic flow, the origin of which lies in the intermolecular interactions between the solute and the interface. These flows on the surface of colloids introduce an effective slip velocity, driving their diffusiophoretic migration. In confined environments, we expect the interplay between diffusiophoretic migration and diffusioosmotic flows near the walls to govern the motion of colloids. These near-wall osmotic flows are, however, often considered weak and neglected. Here, using microfluidic experiments in a T-junction, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show that the interplay between osmotic and phoretic effects leads to unexpected outcomes: forming a colloidal vortex in the absence of inertial effects, and demixing and focusing of the colloids in the direction opposite to what is commonly expected from diffusiophoresis alone. We show these colloidal vortices to be persistent for a range of salt types, salt gradients, and flow rates, and establish a criterion for their emergence. Our work sheds light on how boundaries modulate the solute-mediated transport of colloids in confined environments.</description>

      <title>The role of viscosity on drop impact forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a rigid substrate undergoes deformation and spreading due to normal reaction forces, which are counteracted by surface tension. On a non-wetting substrate, the drop subsequently retracts and takes off. Our recent work (Zhang et al., \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, vol. 129, 2022, 104501) revealed two peaks in the temporal evolution of the normal force $F(t)$ -- one at impact and another at jump-off. The second peak coincides with a Worthington jet formation, which vanishes at high viscosities due to increased viscous dissipation affecting flow focusing. In this article, using experiments, direct numerical simulations, and scaling arguments, we characterize both the peak amplitude $F_1$ at impact and the one at take off ($F_2$) and elucidate their dependency on the control parameters: the Weber number $We$ (dimensionless impact kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity). The first peak amplitude $F_1$ and the time $t_1$ to reach it depend on inertial timescales for low viscosity liquids, remaining nearly constant for viscosities up to 100 times that of water. For high viscosity liquids, we balance the rate of change in kinetic energy with viscous dissipation to obtain new scaling laws: $F_1/F_\rho \sim \sqrt{Oh}$ and $t_1/\tau_\rho \sim 1/\sqrt{Oh}$, where $F_\rho$ and $\tau_\rho$ are the inertial force and time scales, respectively, which are consistent with our data. The time $t_2$ at which the amplitude $F_2$ appears is set by the inertio-capillary timescale $\tau_\gamma$, independent of both the viscosity and the impact velocity of the drop. However, these properties dictate the magnitude of this amplitude.</description>

Abstract: Flow control has a great potential to contribute to the sustainable society through mitigation of environmental burden. However, high dimensional and nonlinear nature of fluid flows poses challenges in designing efficient control laws. This paper aims to propose a hybrid method (i.e., machine learning and control theory) for feedback control of fluid flows. We propose a partially nonlinear linear-system extraction autoencoder (pn-LEAE), which consists of convolutional neural networks-based autoencoder (CNN-AE) and a custom layer to extract a low-dimensional latent dynamics. This pn-LEAE basically extracts a linear dynamical system so that the modern control theory can easily be applied, but at the same time, it is designed to capture a nonlinear development of the latent dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the linear system extracted by the pn-LEAE, as well as the designed control law's effectiveness for a flow around a circular cylinder at the Reynolds number of ${\rm Re}_{D}=100$. This is the first attempt utilizing CNN-AE for linearization of fluid flows involving transient development to design a feedback control law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the melting dynamics of ice suspended in fresh water and subject to natural convective flows. Using direct numerical simulations we investigate the melt rate of ellipsoidal objects for $2.32\times 10^4 \leq \text{Ra} \leq 7.61\times 10^8$, where \text{Ra} is the Rayleigh number defined with the temperature difference between the ice and the surrounding water. We reveal that the system exhibits non-monotonic behavior in three control parameters. As a function of the aspect ratio of the ellipsoidal, the melting time shows a distinct minimum that is different from a disk which has the minimum perimeter. Furthermore, also with \text{Ra} the system shows a non-monotonic trend, since for large \text{Ra} and large aspect ratio the flow separates, leading to distinctly different dynamics. Lastly, since the density of water is non-monotonic with temperature, the melt rate depends non-monotonically also on the ambient temperature, as for intermediate temperatures ($\unit{4}{\celsius}$--$\unit{7}{\celsius}$) the flow is (partially) reversed. In general, the shape which melts the slowest is quite distinct from that of a disk.</description>

      <title>Investigating the shortcomings of the Flow Convergence Method for quantification of Mitral Regurgitation in a pulsatile in-vitro environment and with Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow convergence method includes calculation of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) and is widely used to classify mitral regurgitation (MR) with echocardiography. It constitutes a primary decision factor for determination of treatment and should therefore be a robust quantification method. However, it is known for its tendency to underestimate MR and its dependence on user expertise. The present work systematically compares different pulsatile flow profiles arising from different regurgitation orifices using transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) probe and particle image velocimetry (PIV) as a reference in an in-vitro environment. It is found that the inter-observer variability using echocardiography is small compared to the systematic underestimation of the regurgitation volume for large orifice areas (up to 52%) where a violation of the flow convergence method assumptions occurs. From a flow perspective, a starting vortex was found as a dominant flow pattern in the regurgant jet for all orifice shapes and sizes. A series of simplified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations indicate that selecting a suboptimal aliasing velocity during echocardiography measurements might be a primary source of potential underestimation in MR characterization via the PISA-based method, reaching up to 40%. In this study, it has been noted in clinical observations that physicians often select an aliasing velocity higher than necessary for optimal estimation in diagnostic procedures.</description>

      <title>A real-time digital twin of azimuthal thermoacoustic instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When they occur, azimuthal thermoacoustic oscillations can detrimentally affect the safe operation of gas turbines and aeroengines. We develop a real-time digital twin of azimuthal thermoacoustics of a hydrogen-based annular combustor. The digital twin seamlessly combines two sources of information about the system (i) a physics-based low-order model; and (ii) raw and sparse experimental data from microphones, which contain both aleatoric noise and turbulent fluctuations. First, we derive a low-order thermoacoustic model for azimuthal instabilities, which is deterministic. Second, we propose a real-time data assimilation framework to infer the acoustic pressure, the physical parameters, and the model and measurement biases simultaneously. This is the bias-regularized ensemble Kalman filter (r-EnKF), for which we find an analytical solution that solves the optimization problem. Third, we propose a reservoir computer, which infers both the model bias and measurement bias to close the assimilation equations. Fourth, we propose a real-time digital twin of the azimuthal thermoacoustic dynamics of a laboratory hydrogen-based annular combustor for a variety of equivalence ratios. We find that the real-time digital twin (i) autonomously predicts azimuthal dynamics, in contrast to bias-unregularized methods; (ii) uncovers the physical acoustic pressure from the raw data, i.e., it acts as a physics-based filter; (iii) is a time-varying parameter system, which generalizes existing models that have constant parameters, and capture only slow-varying variables. The digital twin generalizes to all equivalence ratios, which bridges the gap of existing models. This work opens new opportunities for real-time digital twinning of multi-physics problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical-experimental estimation of the deformability of human red blood cells from rheometrical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deformability of human red blood cells (RBCs), which comprise almost 99% of the cells in whole blood, is largely related not only to pathophysiological blood flow but also to the levels of intracellular compounds. Therefore, statistical estimates of the deformability of individual RBCs are of paramount importance in the clinical diagnosis of blood diseases. Although the micro-scale hydrodynamic interactions of individual RBCs lead to non-Newtonian blood rheology, there is no established method to estimate individual RBC deformability from the rheological data of RBC suspensions, and the possibility of this estimation has not been proven. To address this issue, we conducted an integrated analysis of a model of the rheology of RBC suspensions, coupled with macro-rheological data of human RBCs suspended in plasma. Assuming a non-linear curve of the relative viscosity of the suspensions as a function of the cell volume fraction, the statistical average of the membrane shear elasticity was estimated for individual intact RBCs or hardened RBCs. Both estimated values reproduced well the experimentally observed shear-thinning non-Newtonian behavior in these suspensions. We hereby conclude that our complementary approach makes it possible to estimate the statistical average of individual RBC deformability from macro-rheological data obtained with usual rheometric tests.</description>

      <title>Life beyond Fritz: On the detachment of electrolytic bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on detachment characteristics of hydrogen bubbles during electrolysis. Using a transparent (Pt or Ni) electrode enables us to directly observe the bubble contact line and bubble size. Based on these quantities we determine other parameters such as the contact angle and volume through solutions of the Young-Laplace equation. We observe bubbles without ('pinned bubbles') and with ('spreading bubbles') contact line spreading, and find that the latter mode becomes more prevalent if the concentration of HClO4 is greater than or equal to 0.1 M. The departure radius for spreading bubbles is found to drastically exceed the value predicted by the well-known formula of W. Fritz (Physik. Zeitschr. 1935, 36, 379-384) for this case. We show that this is related to the contact line hysteresis, which leads to pinning of the contact line after an initial spreading phase at the receding contact angle. The departure mode is then similar to a pinned bubble and occurs once the contact angle reaches the advancing contact angle of the surface. A prediction for the departure radius based on these findings is found to be consistent with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Basset-Boussinesq history force and inertia are relevant for unsteady particle settling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our experiments on a sphere falling under gravity in Stokes flow show significant history effects. We observe an algebraic, not exponential, relaxation rate to the terminal velocity, validating the solution to the Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen equation. Unlike in steady Stokes theory, our experiments and theory reveal a vortex ring forming around the sphere and drifting away. As the Reynolds number nears unity, the vortex ring lags behind the sphere, departing from Stokesian theory, though the sphere's algebraic response persists. These findings are critical for interactions in the Stokes limit.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to bubble dynamics. A Poisson bracket is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative. A Lagrangian invariant of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--is derived.</description>

      <title>Phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann method for the transport of insoluble surfactant in two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a general second-order phase-field model for the transport of insoluble surfactant in incompressible two-phase flows. In this model, the second-order local Allen-Cahn equation is applied for interface capturing, a general form of the simple scalar transport equation [S. S. Jain, J. Comput. Phys. 515, 113277 (2024)] is adopted for interface-confined surfactant, and the consistent and conservative Navier-Stokes equations with the Marangoni force is used for fluid flows. To solve this model, we further developed a mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, in which the LB model for surfactant transport equation is proposed under the general LB framework for the convection-diffusion type equation, and it can correctly recover the governing equation for surfactant transport. The accuracy of the present LB method is tested by several benchmark problems, and the numerical results show it has a good performance for the transport of the insoluble surfactant in two-phase flows.</description>

      <title>Inertial Momentum Dissipation for Viscosity Solutions of Euler Equations: External Flow Around a Smooth Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local balance of momentum for weak solutions of incompressible Euler equations obtained from the zero-viscosity limit in the presence of solid boundaries, taking as an example flow around a finite, smooth body. We show that both viscous skin friction and wall pressure exist in the inviscid limit as distributions on the body surface. We define a nonlinear spatial flux of momentum toward the wall for the Euler solution, and show that wall friction and pressure are obtained from this momentum flux in the limit of vanishing distance to the wall, for the wall-parallel and wall-normal components, respectively. We show furthermore that the skin friction describing anomalous momentum transfer to the wall will vanish if velocity and pressure are bounded in a neighborhood of the wall and if also the essential supremum of wall-normal velocity within a small distance of the wall vanishes with this distance (a precise form of the vanishing wall-normal velocity condition). In the latter case, all of the limiting drag arises from pressure forces acting on the body and the pressure at the body surface can be obtained as the limit approaching the wall of the interior pressure for the Euler solution. As one application of this result, we show that Lighthill's theory of vorticity generation at the wall is valid for the Euler solutions obtained in the inviscid limit. Further, in a companion work, we show that the Josephson-Anderson relation for the drag, recently derived for strong Navier-Stokes solutions, is valid for weak Euler solutions obtained in their inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity, logarithmic stresses, and tensorial transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce models for viscoelastic materials, both solids and fluids, based on logarithmic stresses to capture the elastic contribution to the material response. The matrix logarithm allows to link the measures of strain, that naturally belong to a multiplicative group of linear transformations, to stresses, that are additive elements of a linear space of tensors. As regards the viscous stresses, we simply assume a Newtonian constitutive law, but the presence of elasticity and plastic relaxation makes the materials non-Newtonian. Our aim is to discuss the existence of weak solutions for the corresponding systems of partial differential equations in the nonlinear large-deformation regime. The main difficulties arise in the analysis of the transport equations necessary to describe the evolution of tensorial measures of strain. For the solid model, we only need to consider the equation for the left Cauchy-Green tensor, while for the fluid model we add an evolution equation for the elastically-relaxed strain. Due to the tensorial nature of the fields, available techniques cannot be applied to the analysis of such transport equations. To cope with this, we introduce the notion of charted weak solution, based on non-standard a priori estimates, that lead to a global-in-time existence of solutions for the viscoelastic models in the natural functional setting associated with the energy inequality.</description>

      <title>Evolution of local relaxed states and the modelling of viscoelastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of continuum mechanical models aimed at describing the behaviour of viscoelastic fluids by incorporating concepts originated in the theory of solid plasticity. Within this class, even a simple model with constant material parameters is able to qualitatively reproduce a number of experimental observations in both simple shear and extensional flows, including linear viscoelastic properties, the rate dependence of steady-state material functions, the stress overshoot in incipient shear flows, and the difference in shear and extensional rheological curves. Furthermore, by allowing the relaxation time of the model to depend on the total strain, we can reproduce some experimental observations of the non-attainability of steady flows in uniaxial extension, and link this to a concept of polymeric jamming or effective solidification. Remarkably, this modelling framework helps in understanding the interplay between different mechanisms that may compete in determining the rheology of non-Newtonian materials.</description>

      <title>Trading particle shape with fluid symmetry: on the mobility matrix in 3D chiral fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral fluids - such as fluids under rotation or a magnetic field as well as synthetic and biological active fluids - flow in a different way than ordinary ones. Due to symmetries broken at the microscopic level, chiral fluids may have asymmetric stress and viscosity tensors, for example giving rise to a hydrostatic torque or non-dissipative (odd) and parity-violating viscosities. In this article, we investigate the motion of rigid bodies in such an anisotropic fluid in the incompressible Stokes regime through the mobility matrix, which encodes the response of a solid body to forces and torques. We demonstrate how the form of the mobility matrix, which is usually determined by particle geometry, can be analogously controlled by the symmetries of the fluid. By computing the mobility matrix for simple shapes in a three-dimensional anisotropic chiral fluid, we predict counter-intuitive phenomena such as motion perpendicular to applied forces and spinning under the force of gravity.</description>
