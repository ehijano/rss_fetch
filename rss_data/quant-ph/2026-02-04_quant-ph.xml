      <title>On the reality of quantum states: A pedagogic survey from classical to quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent experiments claim to show that any model in which a quantum state represents mere information about an underlying physical reality of the system must make predictions which contradict those of quantum theory. The present work undertakes to investigate the issue of reality, treading a more fundamental route from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics to the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics. Motivation for this is a similar approach from the eikonal equation in geometrical optics to the wave equation in electromagnetic theory. We rewrite the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation as a wave equation and seek to generalise de Broglie's wave particle duality by demanding that both particle and light waves have the freedom of being described by any square-integrable function. This generalisation, which allows superposition also for matter wave functions, helps us to obtain the Schrodinger equation, whose solution can be seen to be as much objective as the classical mechanics wave function. Several other equations which one writes in quantum mechanics, including the eigenvalue equations for observables, series expansion of energy states in terms of eigenstates of observables other than energy, etc., can be written in the classical case too. Absence of any collapse of the wave function, entanglement, etc. in the classical realm have their origin in the nonlinearity of the classical wave equation. These considerations indicate that many of the puzzles in quantum mechanics are present also in classical mechanics in a dormant form, which fact shall help to demystify quantum mechanics to a great extent.</description>

      <title>Direct telecom network between atomic and solid-state quantum nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future quantum networks will interconnect quantum systems with distinct functionalities, ideally over long distances via low-loss telecom optical fibers. Here, we realize a two-node hybrid network that directly connects an atomic single photon source to a solid-state quantum memory in the telecom C-band without the need of frequency conversion and external filtering. Both nodes exhibit state-of-the-art performance at 1530 nm: the source achieves a heralded auto-$g^{(2)}(0)$ = 0.031 at a photon rate of 46 kcps, and the memory a storage efficiency of 10.6% with high multimode capacity. We leverage the intrinsic tunability of both nodes to optimize spectral matching, enabling direct networking between the two: single-photon storage and retrieval for 1 $\mu$s over up to 37 temporal modes across extended fibers of 10.6 km (metropolitan) and 49.2 km (laboratory) while preserving non-classicality. These results define a high-bandwidth source-memory link that operates natively in the telecom band, introducing a new paradigm for the design and scaling of hybrid quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Quantum Chaos With Continuous Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum monitoring in the dynamical manifestations of Hamiltonian quantum chaos. Specifically, we analyze the generalized spectral form factor, defined as the survival probability of a coherent Gibbs state under continuous energy measurements. We show that quantum monitoring can tailor the signatures of quantum chaos in the dynamics, such as the extension of the ramp in the spectral form factor, by varying the measurement strength and detection efficiency. In particular, a typical quantum trajectory obtained by monitoring with unit efficiency exhibits enhanced quantum chaos relative to the average dynamics and to unitary evolution without measurements.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the emergence of quantum jumps in a monitored qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum jumps, the collapse of a quantum system upon measurement, are among the most striking consequences of observation in quantum mechanics. While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered fidelity revivals in the PXP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the PXP model when subjected to a periodic drive, and unveil the mechanism through which the interplay between spectral properties and initial states governs the emergence of dynamical revivals and their evolution across the space of driving parameters. For N\'eel-ordered initial states, revivals follow well-defined trajectories in the parameter space of the driving, primarily determined by a dominant quasi-energy spacing in the Floquet spectrum. Initial states interpolating between N\'eel and fully polarized configurations exhibit hybrid dynamics, which can be controlled by tuning their overlap with Floquet eigenstates via the driving parameters. This control also allows steering different routes for avoiding Floquet thermalization, showing how both initial state choice and driving protocol shape long-lived dynamics in this driven quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Integration of Variational Quantum Algorithms into Atomistic Simulation Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the integration of Qiskit Nature's quantum chemistry solvers into the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), enabling hybrid quantum-classical workflows for force-driven atomistic simulations. This coupling allows the use of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its adaptive variant (ADAPT-VQE) not only for ground-state energy calculations, but also for geometry optimisation, vibrational frequency analysis, strain evaluation, and molecular dynamics, all managed through ASE's calculator interface. By applying ADAPT-VQE to multi-electron systems such as BeH2, we obtain vibrational and structural properties in close agreement with high-level classical CCSD calculations within the same minimal basis. These results demonstrate that adaptive variational quantum algorithms can deliver stable and chemically meaningful forces within an atomistic modelling workflow, enabling downstream applications such as molecular dynamics and active-learning accelerated simulations.</description>

      <title>Compiling Quantum Regular Language States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State preparation compilers for quantum computers typically sit at two extremes: general-purpose routines that treat the target as an opaque amplitude vector, and bespoke constructions for a handful of well-known state families. We ask whether a compiler can instead accept simple, structure-aware specifications while providing predictable resource guarantees. We answer this by designing and implementing a quantum state-preparation compiler for regular language states (RLS): uniform superpositions over bitstrings accepted by a regular description, and their complements. Users describe the target state via (i) a finite set of bitstrings, (ii) a regular expression, or (iii) a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), optionally with a complement flag. By translating the input to a DFA, minimizing it, and mapping it to an optimal matrix product state (MPS), the compiler obtains an intermediate representation (IR) that exposes and compresses hidden structure. The efficient DFA representation and minimization offloads expensive linear algebra computation in exchange of simpler automata manipulations. The combination of the regular-language frontend and this IR gives concise specifications not only for RLS but also for their complements that might otherwise require exponentially large state descriptions. This enables state preparation of an RLS or its complement with the same asymptotic resources and compile time. We outline two hardware-aware backends: SeqRLSP, which yields linear-depth, ancilla-free circuits for linear nearest-neighbor architectures via sequential generation, and TreeRLSP, which achieves logarithmic depth on all-to-all connectivity via a tree tensor network. We prove depth and gate-count bounds scaling with the system size and the state's maximal Schmidt rank, and we give explicit compile-time bounds that expose the benefit of our approach. We implement and evaluate the pipeline.</description>

      <title>Inducing, and enhancing, many-body quantum chaos by continuous monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is intuitively expected, and supported by earlier studies, that many-body quantum chaos is suppressed, or even destroyed, by dissipative effects induced by continuous monitoring. We show here that this is not always the case. For this purpose, we study the quenched dynamics of a continuously monitored Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, described by the Lindblad formalism, coupled to a thermal environment modeled by another SYK maintained at constant temperature. We find that the combined effect of monitoring and the thermal bath drives the system toward a non-thermal steady state independently of the initial conditions. The corresponding retarded Green's function exhibits two stages of exponential decay, with rates that depend non-monotonously on the thermal bath coupling and the monitoring strength. In the limit of weak coupling, the late time decay of the Green's function, computed analytically, is closely related to that of the thermal bath. Strikingly, we identify a range of parameters in which continuous monitoring, despite being a source of decoherence, induces or enhances quantum chaotic dynamics suppressed by the thermal bath. For instance, in the limit of weak coupling to the thermal bath, the Lyapunov exponent increases sharply when monitoring is turned on. For intermediate values of the thermal bath coupling, the Lyapunov exponent exhibits re-entrant behavior: it vanishes at zero or sufficiently weak monitoring strength, and becomes positive again as the monitoring strength is increased. Our results offer intriguing insights on the mechanisms leading to quantum scrambling which paves the way to its experimental control and consequently to a performance enhancement of quantum information devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Quantification of Spin-Phonon Coupling in Molecular Qubits using Inelastic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic spin superposition states enable nanoscale sensing through their sensitivity to the local environment, yet their sensitivity to vibrational motion also limits their coherence times. In molecular spin systems, chemical tunability and atomic-scale resolution are accompanied by a dense, thermally accessible phonon spectrum that introduces efficient spin relaxation pathways. Despite extensive theoretical work, there is little experimental consensus on which vibrational energies dominate spin relaxation or how molecular structure controls spin-phonon coupling (SPC). We present a fully experimental method to quantify SPC coefficients by combining temperature-dependent vibrational spectra from inelastic neutron scattering with spin relaxation rates measured by electron paramagnetic resonance. We apply this framework to two model S = 1/2 systems, copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and copper(II) octaethylporphyrin (CuOEP). Two distinct relaxation regimes emerge: below 40 K, weakly coupled lattice modes below $50~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ dominate, whereas above 40 K, optical phonons above ~$185~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ become thermally populated and drive relaxation with SPC coefficients nearly three orders of magnitude larger. Structural distortions in CuOEP that break planar symmetry soften the crystal lattice and enhance anharmonic scattering, but also raise the energy of stretching modes at the molecular core where the spins reside. This redistributes vibrational energy toward the molecular periphery and out of plane, ultimately reducing SPC relative to CuPc and enabling room-temperature spin coherence in CuOEP. Although our method does not provide mode-specific SPC coefficients, it quantifies contributions from distinct spectral regions and establishes a broadly applicable, fully experimental link between crystal structure, lattice dynamics, and spin relaxation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Flow in Microtubule Tryptophan Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of aromatic amino acid residues within microtubules, particularly those formed by tryptophan, may serve as pathways for optical information flow. Ultraviolet excitation dynamics in these networks are typically modeled with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. By extending this approach to a Lindblad master equation that incorporates explicit site geometries and dipole orientations, we track how correlations are generated, routed, and dissipated, while capturing both energy dissipation and information propagation among coupled chromophores. We compare localized injections, fully delocalized preparations, and eigenmode-based initial states. To quantify the emerging quantum-informational structure, we evaluate the $L_1$ norm of coherence, the correlated coherence, and the logarithmic negativity within and between selected chromophore sub-networks. The results reveal a strong dependence of both the direction and persistence of information flow on the type of initial preparation. Superradiant components drive the rapid export of correlations to the environment, whereas subradiant components retain them and slow their leakage. Embedding single tubulin units into larger dimers and spirals reshapes pairwise correlation maps and enables site-selective routing. Scaling to larger ordered lattices strengthens both export and retention channels, whereas static energetic and structural disorder suppresses long-range transport and reduces overall correlation transfer. These findings provide a Lindbladian picture of information flow in cytoskeletal chromophore networks and identify structural and dynamical conditions that transiently preserve nonclassical correlations in microtubules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the quickest change detection of quantum states in a universal setting: specifically, where the post-change quantum state is not known a priori. We establish the asymptotic optimality of a two-stage approach in terms of worst average delay to detection. The first stage employs block POVMs with classical outputs that preserve quantum relative entropy to arbitrary precision. The second stage leverages a recently proposed windowed-CUSUM algorithm that is known to be asymptotically optimal for quickest change detection with an unknown post-change distribution in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Tesseract Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for building robust, fault-tolerant quantum computers; however, the decoding process often presents a significant computational bottleneck. Tesseract is a novel Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoder for QEC that employs the A* search algorithm to explore an exponentially large graph of error hypotheses, achieving high decoding speed and accuracy. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations. We achieved significant decoding speedups across a wide range of code families and configurations, including Color Codes, Bivariate-Bicycle Codes, Surface Codes, and Transversal CNOT Protocols. Our results demonstrate consistent speedups of approximately 2x for most code families, often exceeding 2.5x. Notably, we achieved a peak performance gain of over 5x for the most computationally demanding configurations of Bivariate-Bicycle Codes. These improvements make the Tesseract decoder more efficient and scalable, serving as a practical case study that highlights the importance of high-performance software engineering in QEC and providing a strong foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>Device variability of Josephson junctions induced by interface roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum processors scale to large qubit numbers, device-to-device variability emerges as a critical challenge. Superconducting qubits are commonly realized using Al/AlO$_{\text{x}}$/Al Josephson junctions operating in the tunneling regime, where even minor variations in device geometry can lead to substantial performance fluctuations. In this work, we develop a quantitative model for the variability of the Josephson energy $E_{J}$ induced by interface roughness at the Al/AlO$_{\text{x}}$ interfaces. The roughness is modeled as a Gaussian random field characterized by two parameters: the root-mean-square roughness amplitude $\sigma $ and the transverse correlation length $\xi $. These parameters are extracted from the literature and molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum transport is treated using the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation combined with a local thickness approximation. Numerical simulations over $5,000$ Josephson junctions show that $E_{J}$ follows a log-normal distribution. The mean value of $E_{J}$ increases with $\sigma $ and decreases slightly with $\xi $, while the variance of $E_{J}$ increases with both $\sigma $ and $\xi $. These results paint a quantitative and intuitive picture of Josephson energy variability induced by surface roughness, with direct relevance for junction design.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin-heat engine with trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an ion-trap implementation of the Vaccaro, Barnett and Wright et al. spin-heat engine (SHE); a hypothetical engine that operates between energy and spin thermal reservoirs rather than two energy reservoirs. The SHE operates in two steps: first, in the work extraction stage, heat from a thermal energy reservoir is converted into optical work via a two photon Raman transition resonant with close-to energy degenerate spin states; second, the internal spin states are brought back to their initial state via non-energetic information erasure using a spin reservoir. The latter incurs no energy cost, but rather the reset occurs at the cost of angular momentum from a spin bath that acts as the thermal spin reservoir. The SHE represents an important first step toward demonstrating heat engines that operate beyond the conventional paradigm of requiring two thermal reservoirs, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient quantum simulation of transport phenomena via Hamiltonian embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport phenomena play a key role in a variety of application domains, and efficient simulation of these dynamics remains an outstanding challenge. While quantum computers offer potential for significant speedups, existing algorithms either lack rigorous theoretical guarantees or demand substantial quantum resources, preventing scalable and efficient validation on realistic quantum hardware. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive framework for simulating classes of transport equations, offering both rigorous theoretical guarantees -- including exponential speedups in specific cases -- and a systematic, hardware-efficient implementation. Central to our approach is the Hamiltonian embedding technique, a white-box approach for end-to-end simulation of sparse Hamiltonians that avoids abstract query models and retains near-optimal asymptotic complexity. Empirical resource estimates indicate that our approach can yield an order-of-magnitude (e.g., $42\times$) reduction in circuit depth given favorable problem structures. We then apply our framework to solve linear and nonlinear transport PDEs, including the first experimental demonstration of a 2D advection equation on a trapped-ion quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Combinatorial Optimization: Foundations, Architectures, Benchmarks, and Emerging Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical decision-making issues in science, engineering, and industry are based on combinatorial optimization; however, its application is inherently limited by the NP-hard nature of the problem. A specialized paradigm of analogue quantum computing, quantum annealing (QA), has been proposed to solve these problems by encoding optimization problems into physical energy landscapes and solving them by quantum tunnelling systematically through exploration of solution space. This is a critical review that summarizes the current applications of quantum annealing to combinatorial optimization and includes a theoretical background, hardware designs, algorithm implementation strategies, encoding and embedding schemes, protocols to benchmark quantum annealing, areas of implementation, and links with the quantum algorithms implementation with gate-based hardware and classical solvers. We develop a unified framework, relating adiabatic quantum dynamics, Ising and QUBO models, stoquastic and non-stoquastic Hamiltonians, and diabatic transitions to modern flux-qubit annealers (Chimera, Pegasus, Zephyr topologies), and emergent architectures (Lechner-Hauke-Zoller systems, Rydberg atom platforms), and hybrids of quantum and classical computation. Through our analysis, we find that overhead in embedding and encoding is the largest determinant of the scalability and performance (this is not just the number of qubits). Minor embeddings also usually have a physical qubit count per logical variable of between 5 and 12 qubits, which limits effective problem capacity by 80-92% and, due to chain-breaking errors, compromises the quality of solutions.</description>

      <title>Validating a Koopman-Quantum Hybrid Paradigm for Diagnostic Denoising of Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in data-intensive science is strictly bottlenecked the difficulty of interfacing high-dimensional, chaotic classical data into resource-limited, noisy quantum processors. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physics-informed Koopman-Quantum hybrid framework, theoretically grounded in a representation-level structural isomorphism we establish between the Koopman operator, which linearizes nonlinear dynamics, and quantum evolution. Based on this theoretical foundation, we design a realizable NISQ-friendly pipeline: the Koopman operator functions as a physics-aware "data distiller," compressing waveforms into compact, "quantum-ready" features, which are subsequently processed by a modular, parallel quantum neural network. We validated this framework on 4,763 labeled channel sequences from 433 discharges of the tokamak system. The results demonstrate that our model achieves 97.0\% accuracy in screening corrupted diagnostic data, matching the performance of state-of-the-art deep classical CNNs while using orders-of-magnitude fewer trainable parameters. This work establishes a practical, physics-grounded paradigm for leveraging quantum processing in constrained environments, offering a scalable path for quantum-enhanced edge computing.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the currently achievable distance of quantum key distribution based on sending-or-not-sending approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protocols based on the sending-or-not-sending (SNS) principle have been intensively studied in recent years and have been shown to enable the longest transmission distances in quantum key distribution (QKD). In this work, we propose a sending-or-not-sending phase-matching QKD protocol (SNS-PM-QKD) that improves tolerance to phase mismatch, thereby extending the achievable transmission distance. We present a security analysis of SNS-PM-QKD in the asymptotic (infinite-key) regime under collective attacks. The performance of the proposed protocol is compared with that of standard phase-matching QKD, theoretical SNS-type twin-field QKD protocols (SNS-TF-QKD), and an experimental SNS-TF-QKD operated over transmission distances of up to 1002km. Our results show that SNS-PM-QKD achieves greater transmission distances than these existing protocols, highlighting its potential for long-distance quantum communication.</description>

      <title>A Tunable, Modeless, and Hybridization-free Cross-Kerr Coupler for Miniaturized Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits typically use capacitive charge-based linear coupling schemes to control interactions between elements such as qubits. While simple and effective, this coupling scheme makes it difficult to satisfy competing circuit design requirements such as maintaining large qubit anharmonicity and coherence along with a high degree of qubit connectivity and packing density. Moreover, tunable interactions using linear coupling elements produce dynamical variations in mode hybridization, which can induce non-adiabatic transitions, resulting in leakage errors and limiting gate speeds. In this work we attempt to address these challenges by proposing a junction-based coupling architecture based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) couplers with relatively small Josephson energies. SQUID couplers provide intrinsic cross-Kerr interactions that can be controlled by external fluxes and that do not rely on mode hybridization. The small Josephson energies of the coupler maintain the interaction at a perturbative scale, which limits undesired higher-order mixing between coupled elements while achieving a sufficiently strong cross-Kerr interaction originating from diagonal coupling elements. Based on these properties, we show that a SQUID coupler can be used to implement a fast, adiabatic, and high-fidelity controlled-Z gate without introducing extra modes, and the operation is robust against junction asymmetry for high-frequency qubits. Although unconventional crosstalk may arise due to junction asymmetries and parasitic hybridization with spectator qubits, we show that these effects are sufficiently small for realistic circuit parameters. As an example of the utility of such junction-based coupling schemes, we present a scalable tiling strategy for a miniaturized superconducting quantum processor based on merged-element transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian Gap in Dissipative Haar-Doped Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures such as spectral statistics, OTOCs, and entanglement growth, which need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $\gamma$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $\Delta \sim \gamma N$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\to\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $\gamma\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $\gamma\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period.</description>

Abstract: We show how the macroscopic state variables pressure, entropy and temperature of equilibrium thermodynamics can be consistently derived from the (quantum) chaotic spectral structure of one or two particles in two-dimensional domains. This provides a definition of work and heat from first principles, a microscopic underpinning of the first and second law of thermodynamics, and a transparent illustration of the ``eigenstate thermalization hypothesis''.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Numerical Studies of Barren Plateau and Overparametrization in Variational Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a parametrized quantum circuit is widely applicable to near-term quantum computing, but its fundamental issues that limit optimization performance have been reported in the literature. For example, VQA optimization often suffers from vanishing gradients called barren plateau (BP) and the presence of local minima in the landscape of the cost function. Numerical studies have shown that the trap in local minima is significantly reduced when the circuit is overparametrized (OP), where the number of parameters exceeds a certain threshold. Theoretical understanding of the BP and OP phenomena has advanced over the past years, however, comprehensive studies of both effects in the same setting are not fully covered in the literature. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive numerical study in VQA, quantitatively evaluating the impacts of BP and OP and their interplay on the optimization of a variational quantum circuit, using concrete implementations of one-dimensional transverse and longitudinal field quantum Ising model. The numerical results are compared with the theoretical diagnostics of BP and OP phenomena. The framework presented in this paper will provide a guiding principle for designing VQA algorithms and ansatzes with theoretical support for behaviors of parameter optimization in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-protected entangling gates in a silicon carbide quantum node</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state color centers are promising candidates for nodes in quantum network architectures. However, realizing scalable and fully functional quantum nodes, comprising both processor and memory qubits with high-fidelity universal gate operations, remains a central challenge in this field. Here, we demonstrate a fully functional quantum node in silicon carbide, where electron spins act as quantum processors and nuclear spins serve as quantum memory. Specifically, we design a pulse sequence that combines dynamical decoupling with hyperfine interactions to realize decoherence-protected universal gate operations between the processor and memory qubits. Leveraging this gate, we deterministically prepare entangled states within the quantum node, achieving a fidelity of 90%, which exceeds the fault-tolerance threshold of certain quantum network architectures. These results open a pathway toward scalable and fully functional quantum nodes based on silicon carbide.</description>

      <title>Even More Efficient Soft-Output Decoding with Extra-Cluster Growth and Early Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, soft outputs from real-time decoders play a crucial role in improving decoding accuracy, post-selecting magic states, and accelerating lattice surgery. A recent paper by Meister et al. [arXiv:2405.07433 (2024)] proposed an efficient method to evaluate soft outputs for cluster-based decoders, including the Union-Find (UF) decoder. However, in parallel computing environments, its computational complexity is comparable to or even surpasses that of the UF decoder itself, resulting in a substantial overhead. Furthermore, this method requires global information about the decoding graph, making it poorly suited for existing hardware implementations of the UF decoder on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In this paper, to alleviate these issues, we develop more efficient methods for evaluating high-quality soft outputs in cluster-based decoders by introducing several early-stopping techniques. Our central idea is that the precise value of a large soft output is often unnecessary in practice. Based on this insight, we introduce two types of novel soft-outputs: the bounded cluster gap and the extra-cluster gap. The former reduces the computational complexity of Meister's method by terminating the calculation at an early stage. Our numerical simulations show that this method achieves improved scaling with code distance $d$ compared to the original proposal. The latter, the extra-cluster gap, quantifies decoder reliability by performing a small, additional growth of the clusters obtained by the decoder. This approach offers the significant advantage of enabling soft-output computation without modifying the existing architecture of FPGA-implemented UF decoders. These techniques offer lower computational complexity and higher hardware compatibility, laying a crucial foundation for future real-time decoders with soft outputs.</description>

      <title>Zak phase and bulk-boundary correspondence in a generalized Dirac-Kronig-Penney model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of a generalized Dirac--Kronig--Penney model, a continuum one-dimensional model for a relativistic quantum chain. By tuning the coupling parameters this model can accommodate five Altland--Zirnbauer--Cartan symmetry classes, three of which (AIII, BDI and D) support non-trivial topological phases in dimension one. We characterize analytically the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian in terms of a spectral function, and numerically compute the Zak phase to probe the bulk topological content of the insulating phases. Our findings reveal that, while the Zak phase is quantized in classes AIII and BDI, it exhibits non-quantized values in class D, challenging its traditional role as a topological marker in continuum settings. We also discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence for a truncated version of the chain, analyzing how the emergence of edge states depends on both the truncation position and the boundary conditions. In classes AIII and BDI, we find that the Zak phase effectively detects edge states as a relative boundary topological index, although the correspondence is highly sensitive to the parameters characterizing the truncation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non-local features that complement classical processing. We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results on the full MNIST dataset (digits 0-9) demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating structurally coherent and recognizable images for all digit classes. While hardware constraints still impose limitations on resolution, our findings suggest that hybrid architectures with adaptive measurements provide a feasible pathway for mitigating mode collapse and enhancing generative capabilities in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of quantum entanglement between the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere, coupled by coherent scattering to an optical cavity mode, and the electromagnetic field. Using heterodyne detection, we reconstruct the full set of optical-mechanical correlations and observe a violation of separability bounds between the mechanical degrees of freedom and the propagating optical mode. Thus, we demonstrate the ability to distribute nonclassical correlations beyond the interaction region. Our results are obtained at room temperature and are robust over a broad range of detunings set by the cavity linewidth. These findings establish levitated optomechanical systems as a promising platform for macroscopic quantum optics and for future tests of fundamental physics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorem to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Quantum Wire Cutting for QAOA: Performance Benchmarks in Ideal and Noisy Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum computers suffer from a limited number of qubits and high error rates, limiting practical applicability. Different techniques exist to mitigate these effects and run larger algorithms. In this work, we analyze one of these techniques called quantum circuit cutting. With circuit cutting, a quantum circuit is decomposed into smaller sub-circuits, each of which can be run on smaller quantum hardware. We compare the performance of quantum circuit cutting with different cutting strategies, and then apply circuit cutting to a QAOA algorithm. Using simulations, we first show that Randomized Clifford measurements outperform both Pauli and random unitary measurements. Second, we show that circuit cutting has trouble providing correct answers in noisy settings, especially as the number of circuits increases.</description>

      <title>QRC-Lab: An Educational Toolbox for Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) has emerged as a strong pa- radigm for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machine learning, ena- bling the processing of temporal data with minimal training overhead by exploi- ting the high-dimensional dynamics of quantum states. This paper introduces QRC-Lab, an open-source, modular Python framework designed to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum dynamics and applied machine learning work- flows. We provide a rigorous definition of QRC, contrast physical and gate- based approaches, and formalize the reservoir mapping used in the toolbox. QRC-Lab instantiates a configurable gate-based laboratory for studying in- put encoding, reservoir connectivity, and measurement strategies, and validates these concepts through three educational case studies: short-term memory re- construction, temporal parity (XOR), and NARMA10 forecasting as a deliberate stress test. In addition, we include a learning-theory motivated generalization- gap scan to build intuition about capacity control in quantum feature maps.

      <title>Microscopic derivation of a completely positive master equation for the description of Open Quantum Brownian Motion of a particle in a potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Quantum Brownian Motion (OQBM) was introduced as a scaling limit of discrete-time open quantum walks. This limit defines a new class of quantum Brownian motion, which incorporates both the external and internal degrees of freedom of the Brownian particle. We consider a weakly driven Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential and dissipatively coupled to a thermal bath. Applying the rotating wave approximation (RWA) to the system-bath interaction Hamiltonian, we derive a completely positive Born-Markov master equation for the reduced dynamics. We express the resulting master equation in the coordinate representation and, utilizing the adiabatic elimination of fast variables, derive a completely positive hybrid quantum-classical master equation that defines OQBM. We illustrate the resulting dynamics using examples of initial Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions of the OQBM walker. Both examples reveal the emergence of Gaussian distributions in the limiting behavior of the OQBM dynamics, which closely matches that of the standard OQBM. With the help of the obtained OQBM master equation, we derive the equations for the $n$-th moments and the cumulants of the position distribution of the open Brownian walker. We subsequently solve these equations numerically for Gaussian initial distributions across various parameter regimes. Notably, we find that the third-order cumulant is nonzero, indicating that the dynamics' intrinsic generator is non-Gaussian.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of the Remote CX Protocol under Noise in Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers connected through classical and quantum communication channels can be combined to function as a single unit to run large quantum circuits that each device is unable to execute on their own. The distributed quantum computing paradigm is therefore often seen as a potential pathway to scaling quantum computing to capacities necessary for practical and large-scale applications. Whether connecting multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) in clusters or over networks, quantum communication requires entanglement to be generated and distributed over distances. Using entanglement, the remote CX protocol can be performed, which allows the application of the CX gate involving qubits located in different QPUs. In this work, we use a specialized simulation framework for a high-level evaluation of the impact of the protocol when executed under noise in various network configurations using different number of QPUs. We compare naive and graph partitioning qubit assignment strategies and how they affect the fidelity in experiments run on Grover, GHZ, VQC, and random circuits. The results provide insights on how QPU and network configurations or naive scheduling can degrade performance.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang tensors and Hamiltonian complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex tensor with $n$ binary indices can be identified with a multilinear polynomial in $n$ complex variables. We say it is a Lee-Yang tensor with radius $r$ if the polynomial is nonzero whenever all variables lie in the open disk of radius $r$. In this work we study quantum states and observables which are Lee-Yang tensors when expressed in the computational basis. We first review their basic properties, including closure under tensor contraction and certain quantum operations. We show that quantum states with Lee-Yang radius $r &gt; 1$ can be prepared by quasipolynomial-sized circuits. We also show that every Hermitian operator with Lee-Yang radius $r &gt; 1$ has a unique principal eigenvector. These results suggest that $r = 1$ is a key threshold for quantum states and observables. Finally, we consider a family of two-local Hamiltonians where every interaction term energetically favors a deformed EPR state $|00\rangle + s|11\rangle$ for some $0 \leq s \leq 1$. We numerically investigate this model and find that on all graphs considered the Lee-Yang radius of the ground state is at least $r = 1/\sqrt{s}$ while the spectral gap between the two smallest eigenvalues is at least $1-s^2$. We conjecture that these lower bounds hold more generally; in particular, this would provide an efficient quantum adiabatic algorithm for the quantum Max-Cut problem on uniformly weighted bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Effective Hamiltonian for Quantum Computing and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective Hamiltonian serves as the conceptual pivot of quantum engineering, transforming physical complexity into programmable logic; yet, its construction remains compromised by the mathematical non-uniqueness of block diagonalization, which introduces an intrinsic "gauge freedom" that standard methods fail to resolve. We address this by establishing the Least Action Unitary Transformation (LAUT) as the fundamental principle for effective models. By minimizing geometric action, LAUT guarantees dynamical fidelity and inherently enforces the preservation of symmetries--properties frequently violated by conventional Schrieffer-Wolff and Givens rotation techniques. We identify the Bloch-Brandow formalism as the natural perturbative counterpart to this principle, yielding analytic expansions that preserve symmetries to high order. We validate this framework against experimental data from superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating that LAUT quantitatively reproduces interaction rates in driven entangling gates where standard approximations diverge. Furthermore, in tunable coupler architectures, we demonstrate that the LAUT approach captures essential non-rotating-wave contributions that standard models neglect; this inclusion is critical for quantitatively reproducing interaction rates and revealing physical multi-body interactions such as $XZX+YZY$, which are verified to be physical rather than gauge artifacts. By reconciling variational optimality with analytical tractability, this work provides a systematic, experimentally validated route for high-precision system learning and Hamiltonian engineering.</description>

      <title>Anti-Critical Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical quantum metrology exploits the dramatic growth of the quantum Fisher information near quantum phase transitions to enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Traditionally, this enhancement is associated with a closing energy gap, which causes the characteristic timescales for adiabatic preparation or relaxation to diverge with increasing system size. Consequently, the apparent growth of the quantum Fisher information largely reflects the increasing evolution time induced by critical slowing down, rather than a genuine gain in metrological performance, thereby severely limiting the practical usefulness of such protocols. Here we show that the relationship between energy-gap variations, quantum Fisher information, and achievable precision is far more subtle in interacting quantum systems: enhanced sensitivity does not require a vanishing gap, and, perhaps more surprisingly, a decreasing quantum Fisher information does not necessarily imply reduced precision once the time is properly taken into account. Building on this insight, we introduce an anti-critical metrology scheme that achieves enhanced precision while the energy gap increases. We illustrate this mechanism using the quantum Rabi model, thereby identifying a route to metrological advantage that avoids the critical slowing down associated with conventional criticality.</description>

      <title>Universal Characterization of Quantum Vacuum Measurement Engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can inject energy into quantum systems, enabling engines whose operation is powered entirely by measurements. We develop a general theory of quantum vacuum measurement engines by introducing the quantum vacuum bending function (QVBF), a quantity that characterizes the lowering of the ground-state energy due to interactions. We show that all thermodynamic observables, including work and efficiency, are governed solely by the shape of the ground-state energy landscape encoded in the QVBF, regardless of microscopic details. We further demonstrate that work fluctuations are defined by the curvature of QVBF modulated by a model-dependent quantity, and are constrained by a generalized quantum fluctuation relation that involves the interplay between quantum Fisher information and the ground-state energy landscape. Exactly solvable models and numerical simulations of single and many-body systems confirm the theory and illustrate how the QVBF alone determines the performance of quantum vacuum measurement engines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Electronic Circular Dichroism Spectrum Prediction of Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy captures the chiroptical response of molecules, enabling absolute configuration assignment that is vital for enantioselective synthesis and drug design. The practical use of ECD spectra in predictive modeling remains restricted, as existing approaches offer limited confidence for chiral discrimination. By contrast, theoretical ECD calculations demand substantial computational effort rooted in electronic structure theory, which constrains their scalability to larger chemically diverse molecules. These limitations underscore the need for computational approaches that retain first principles physical rigor while enabling efficient and scalable prediction. Motivated by recent advances in quantum algorithms for chemistry, we introduce a variational quantum framework combined with the quantum equation of motion formalism to compute molecular properties and predict ECD spectra, implemented within a multi GPU or QPU accelerated hybrid quantum/classical workflow. We demonstrate its efficient applicability on 12 clinically relevant chiral drug molecules accessing expanded active spaces. The proposed framework is assessed by comparison with established classical wavefunction based methods, employing Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) for ground-state energy benchmarks and Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CASCI) as the reference method for excited state energies and chiroptical properties within the same active orbital space. Notably, the quantum computed ECD spectra, obtained from chemically relevant active spaces mapped onto quantum circuits of approximately 20 to 24 qubits, exhibit near quantitative agreement with classical reference calculations, accurately reproducing spectral line shapes, Cotton effect signs, and relative peak intensities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedups for Derivative Pricing Beyond Black-Scholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores advancements in quantum algorithms for derivative pricing of exotics, a computational pipeline of fundamental importance in quantitative finance. For such cases, the classical Monte Carlo integration procedure provides the state-of-the-art provable, asymptotic performance: polynomial in problem dimension and quadratic in inverse-precision. While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling L\'evy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types.
  We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures. Finally, we critique quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solvers as a method for derivative pricing based on amplitude estimation, identifying theoretical barriers that obstruct achieving a quantum speedup through this approach. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of quantum algorithms in derivative pricing, addressing key challenges and open questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Distributed Phase-Insensitive Displacement Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing leverages quantum correlations among multiple sensors to enhance the precision of parameter estimation beyond classical limits. Most existing approaches target phase estimation and rely on a shared phase reference between the signal and the probe, yet many relevant scenarios deal with regimes where such a reference is absent, making the estimation of force or field amplitudes the main task. We study this phase-insensitive regime for bosonic sensors that undergo identical displacements with common phases randomly varying between experimental runs. We derive analytical bounds on the achievable precision and show that it is determined by first-order normal correlations between modes in the probe state, constrained by their average excitations. These correlations yield a collective sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit, with a gain that grows linearly in the total excitation number, revealing a distributed quantum advantage even without a global phase reference. We identify families of multimode states with definite joint parity that saturate this limit and can be probed efficiently via local parity measurements already demonstrated or emerging in several quantum platforms. We further demonstrate that experimentally relevant decoherence channels favor two distinct sensing strategies: splitting of a single-mode nonclassical state among the modes, which is robust to loss and heating, and separable probes, which are instead resilient to dephasing and phase jitter. Our results are relevant to multimode continuous platforms, including trapped-ion, solid-state mechanical, optomechanical, superconducting, and photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum noise of a solid-state spin ensemble with dispersive measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore protocols for measuring the spin polarization of an ensemble of solid-state spins, with precision at or below the standard quantum limit. Such measurements in the solid-state are challenging, as standard approaches based on optical fluorescence are often limited by poor readout fidelity. Indirect microwave resonator-mediated measurements provide an attractive alternative, though a full analysis of relevant sources of measurement noise is lacking. In this work we study dispersive readout of an inhomogeneously broadened spin ensemble via coupling to a driven resonator measured via homodyne detection. We derive generic analytic conditions for when the homodyne measurement can be limited by the fundamental spin-projection noise, as opposed to microwave-drive shot noise or resonator phase noise. By studying fluctuations of the measurement record in detail, we also propose an experimental protocol for directly detecting spin squeezing, i.e. a reduction of the spin ensemble's intrinsic projection noise from entanglement. Our protocol provides a method for benchmarking entangled states for quantum-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Accelerating qubit reset through the Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive qubit reset is a key primitive for quantum information processing, whereby qubits are initialized by allowing them to relax to their ground state through natural dissipation, without the need for active control or feedback. However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic execution. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting the Mpemba effect, originally indicating the faster cooling of hot systems compared to cooler ones. Focusing on the regime where coherence times exceed energy relaxation times ($T_2 &gt; T_1$), we propose a simple protocol based on a single entangling two-qubit gate that converts local single-qubit coherences into fast-decaying global two-qubit coherences. This removes their overlap with the slowest decaying Liouvillian mode and enables a substantially faster relaxation to the ground state. For realistic parameters, we find that our protocol can reduce reset times by up to $50\%$ compared to standard passive reset. We analyze the robustness of the protocol under non-Markovian noise, imperfect coherent control and finite temperature, finding that the accelerated reset persists across a broad range of realistic error sources. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of our protocol on an IQM superconducting quantum processor. Our results demonstrate how Mpemba-like accelerated relaxation can be harnessed as a practical tool for fast and accurate qubit initialization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in formulating a theory of quantum gravity is to determine the size and structure of the Hilbert space of black holes. Here we use a quantum dynamical Krylov complexity approach to calculate the Hilbert space dimension of a black hole in 2+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. We achieve this by obtaining the spread of an initial thermofield double state over the Krylov basis. The associated Lanczos coefficients match those for chaotic motion on the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group. By including non-perturbative effects in the path integral, which computes coarse-grained ensemble averages, we find that the complexity saturates at late times. The saturation value is given by the exponential of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our results introduce a new way to compute the Hilbert space dimension of complex interacting systems from the saturating value of spread complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal invariance often accompanies criticality in Hermitian systems. However, its fate in non-Hermitian settings is less clear, especially near exceptional points where the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable. Here we investigate whether a 1+1-dimensional gapless non-Hermitian system can admit a conformal description, focusing on a PT-symmetric free-fermion field theory. Working in the biorthogonal formalism, we identify the conformal structure of this theory by constructing a traceless energy-momentum tensor whose Fourier modes generate a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=-2$. This yields a non-Hermitian, biorthogonal realization of a logarithmic conformal field theory, in which correlation functions exhibit logarithmic scaling and the spectrum forms Virasoro staggered modules that are characterized by universal indecomposability parameters. We further present a microscopic construction and show how the same conformal data (with finite-size corrections) can be extracted from the lattice model at exceptional-point criticality, thereby supporting the field-theory prediction.</description>

Abstract: Accessing the thermodynamic-limit properties of strongly correlated quantum matter requires simulations on very large lattices, a regime that remains challenging for numerical methods, especially in frustrated two-dimensional systems. We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations. We finally demonstrate the generality of the method by obtaining state-of-the-art energies for a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a $20\times20$ square lattice, outperforming Residual Convolutional Neural Networks.</description>

      <title>Modular Krylov Complexity as a Boundary Probe of Area Operator and Entanglement Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the area operator of a quantum extremal surface can be reconstructed directly from boundary dynamics without reference to bulk geometry. Our approach combines the operator-algebra quantum error-correction (OAQEC) structure of AdS/CFT with modular Krylov complexity. Using Lanczos coefficients of boundary modular dynamics, we extract the spectrum of the modular Hamiltonian restricted to the algebra of the entanglement wedge and isolate its central contribution, which is identified with the area operator. The construction is purely boundary-based and applies to superpositions of semiclassical geometries as well. As an application, we diagnose island formation and the Page transition in evaporating black holes using boundary modular evolution alone, bypassing any bulk extremization. More broadly, our results establish modular Krylov complexity as a concrete and computable probe of emergent spacetime geometry, providing a new route to accessing black hole interiors from boundary quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tomography of Fermion Pairs in $e^+e^-$ Collisions: Longitudinal Beam Polarization Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum tomography study of fermion pair production at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, emphasizing how longitudinal beam polarization controls the two-qubit spin density matrix. We study the processes $e^+ e^- \to t\bar{t},\ e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-$, representing the mass threshold behavior, the $Z$ pole resonance and the $s/t$-channel interplay. We choose to focus on three key concepts: quantum entanglement via the concurrence $\mathcal{C}$, Bell nonlocality via the optimal Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) parameter $\mathcal{B}$, and non-stabilizerness (``magic'') via the second stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $\mathcal{M}_2$. For the $s$-channel-dominated channels, longitudinal polarization mainly reshapes single-spin polarizations while leaving the spin-correlation matrix largely unchanged, rendering $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ comparatively robust, but inducing a pronounced variation of $\mathcal{M}_2$. In contrast, in Bhabha scattering, polarization modifies the relative contributions of the $s$-channel and $t$-channel and can strongly affect all three observables. The observability of entanglement, Bell nonlocality, and magic exceeds the $5\sigma$ level when both statistical and systematic uncertainties are included, establishing the fermion pair systems as ideal laboratories for quantum-information studies in high energy leptonic collisions. With optimized beam polarization, future $e^+e^-$ colliders will provide a unique opportunity to experimentally explore and influence quantum resources in particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Simulations of Strongly Coupled Spin Ensembles for Inferring Nature of Electronic Correlations from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an efficient package for the simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance spin echo experiments to study the effects of strong electronic spin correlations on the dynamics of the nuclear spin ensemble. A mean-field model is used to study correlated electronic phases through their hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. We explore the dynamics of the interacting nuclear ensemble and discuss the key behaviors of the system. In particular, we classify the types of temporal asymmetry that the interaction induces in the system as well as a pulse-dependent shift in the spectral domain. Us- ing these results, we discuss how careful measurement of the pulse-dependent shiftcanbeusedtoextractinformationabouttheanisotropyoftheelectronic interaction and how these results represent a novel tool for the examination of exotic NMR signatures in strongly correlated materials. Finally, we re- view specific aspects of the simulation package developed for our exploration and give explicit examples where package can be used to infer range and anisotropy of electronic correlations. In particular, we discuss its structure, accuracy, and the technical merits of the various approximations used to model the nuclear spin ensemble.</description>

      <title>Wave packet description of Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field are considered using the wave packets formalism. The modified Dirac equation for Majorana neutrinos with non-zero transition magnetic moments propagating in a magnetic field is solved analytically in the two flavour case. The expressions for the oscillations probabilities are derived accounting for the decoherence effect emerging at distances exceeding the coherence length. It is shown that for Majorana neutrinos propagating in a magnetic field the coherence length coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum when the vacuum frequency is much greater than the magnetic frequency ($\omega_{vac} \gg \omega_B$), while it is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum if ($\omega_{vac} \ll \omega_B$). We show that the decoherence effect may appear during neutrino propagation in a magnetic field of supernova.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition in transverse-field Ising model on Sierpi\'nski gasket lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket. By applying finite-size scaling and numerical renormalization group methods, we determine the critical coupling and the exponents that describe this transition. We first checked our finite-size scaling and the renormalization methods on the exactly solvable one-dimensional chain, where we recovered proper values of critical couplings and exponents. Then, we applied the method to the Sierpi\'nski gasket with 11 and 15 spins. We found a quantum critical point at $\lambda_c \approx 2.72$ to $2.93$, with critical exponents $z\approx0.84$, $\nu \approx 1.12 $, $\beta \approx 0.30$, and $\gamma \approx 2.54$. The lower dynamical exponent $z$ indicates that quantum fluctuations slow down due to fractal geometry, yielding an effective critical dimension of about 2.43. The numerical renormalization group method yielded similar results $\lambda_c = 2.765$, $\beta = 0.306$, supporting our findings. These exponents differ from those in both the one-dimensional and mean-field cases.</description>

      <title>Efficient Three-Dimensional Sub-Doppler Cooling of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ in a Penning Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate efficient sub-Doppler laser cooling of the three eigenmodes of a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion confined in a compact Penning trap operating with a magnetic field of 0.91 T. Using the same set of laser beams as required for the initial Doppler laser cooling operation, we detune the laser frequencies to produce a narrow two-photon dark resonance. The process achieves a 1/e cooling time constant of 108(8) $\mu$s, ultimately reducing the mean thermal axial mode occupation from 72(23) to 1.5(3) in 800 $\mu$s as measured by resonantly probing an electric quadrupole transition near 729 nm. A parametric drive is applied to the trap electrodes which coherently exchanges the axial mode occupation with that of each radial mode, allowing for three-dimensional sub-Doppler cooling using only the axially-propagating laser beams. This sub-Doppler cooling is achieved for an axial oscillation frequency of $\omega_z = 2\pi~\times~$221 kHz, which places the motion well outside of the Lamb Dicke confinement regime at the Doppler laser cooling limit. Our measured cooling rate and final mode occupation are in good agreement with a semiclassical model which combines a Lindblad master equation solution for ion-photon interactions with classical harmonic oscillator motion of the trapped ion.</description>

      <title>Physics-inspired transformer quantum states via latent imaginary-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful ans\"atze in the variational Monte Carlo framework, yet their architectures are often treated as black boxes. We propose a physically transparent framework in which NQS are treated as neural approximations to latent imaginary-time evolution. This viewpoint suggests that standard Transformer-based NQS (TQS) architectures correspond to physically unmotivated effective Hamiltonians dependent on imaginary time in a latent space. Building on this interpretation, we introduce physics-inspired transformer quantum states (PITQS), which enforce a static effective Hamiltonian by sharing weights across layers and improve propagation accuracy via Trotter-Suzuki decompositions without increasing the number of variational parameters. For the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, our ans\"atze achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art TQS while using substantially fewer variational parameters. This study demonstrates that reinterpreting the deep network structure as a latent cooling process enables a more physically grounded, systematic, and compact design, thereby bridging the gap between black-box expressivity and physically transparent construction.</description>

      <title>Tuning interactions between static-field-shielded polar molecules with microwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to tune interparticle interactions is one of the main advantages of using ultracold quantum gases for quantum simulation of many-body physics. Current experiments with ultracold polar molecules employ shielding with microwave or static electric fields to prevent destructive collisional losses. The interaction potential of microwave-shielded molecules can be tuned by using microwaves of two different polarisations, while for static-field-shielded molecules the tunability of interactions is more limited and depends on the particular species. In this work, we propose a general method to tune the interactions between static-field-shielded molecules by applying a microwave field. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations in a field-dressed basis set to determine loss rate coefficients and scattering lengths. We find that both the s-wave scattering length and the dipole length can be widely tuned by changing the parameters of the microwave field, while maintaining strong suppression of lossy collisions.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and how to sense them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons are the low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. While the magnetic moment of a ferromagnet aligns with an applied magnetic field, it has been experimentally shown that the magnetic order can be inverted by injecting spin current into the magnet. This results in an energetically unstable but dynamically stabilized state where the magnetic moment aligns antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, called the inverted magnetic state. The excitations on top of such a state have negative energy and are called antimagnons. The inverted state is subject to fluctuations, in particular, as shot noise in the spin current, which are different from fluctuations in equilibrium, especially at low temperatures. Here, we theoretically study the fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and their signatures in experimental setups. We find that the fluctuations from the injection of spin current play a large role. In the quantum regime, the inverted magnetic state exhibits larger fluctuations compared to the equilibrium position, which can be probed using a qubit. Our results advance the understanding of the fundamental properties of antimagnons and their experimental controllability, and they pave the way for applications in spintronics and magnonics, such as spin wave amplification and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg XXX chain with negative spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the isotropic Heisenberg XXX spin chain with negative spin, focusing on the case $s=-1$. The model is equivalent to the quantum lattice nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) model and appears as an effective theory in deep inelastic scattering in high-energy quantum chromodynamics. Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined thermodynamic limit. Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties.
  In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected.
  We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes. At zero temperature, the excitation spectrum becomes linear in the continuum limit and can be described by a conformal field theory. The low-temperature regime realizes a Luttinger-liquid like phase with features unique to the negative spin XXX chain.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limit time for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in matter with non-standard interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, we investigate the transition probabilities of an initial muon neutrino flavor state in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSIs) characterized by complex off-diagonal ($|\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}|e^{i\phi_{\alpha\beta}}$) and diagonal parameters ($|\epsilon_{\alpha\alpha}-\epsilon_{\beta\beta}|$), including a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, under both normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO) scenarios. Within these scenarios and through the lens of mode entanglement, bipartite entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement are quantified in terms of the transition probabilities, which can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments. Using these two bipartite entanglement measures, we further explore the quantum speed limit (QSL) time, which describes how rapidly bipartite entanglement evolves during neutrino oscillations. We illustrate our results using the baseline lengths and energies corresponding to ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, such as T2K, NO$\nu$A, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. In the presence of a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, both with and without NSI effects, we compare the QSL time behavior for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations for NO and IO. The most pronounced discrepancies in the QSL time for bipartite entanglement arise from the off-diagonal NSI parameter $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$ across both the NO and IO scenarios. We emphasize that among all the experiments considered, NO$\nu$A and DUNE exhibit a rapid suppression of bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in the standard oscillation scenario with NO at the end of their baseline lengths for the corresponding best-fit value of CP-violating phase. Our results hint at a possible imprint of new physics in neutrino oscillations.</description>

Abstract: Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics arises from the coupling between a classical system and a quantum environment. Unlike standard thermal reservoirs, this environment acts as a dynamic bath, capable of simultaneously exchanging heat and performing work. We formulate a thermodynamic framework for this semi-classical regime, defining heat, work, and entropy production. We derive a modified Second Law that accounts for non-equilibrium quantum features, such as squeezing. The framework is exemplified by an optomechanical setup, where we characterize the thermodynamics of the non-stationary noise induced by the cavity field.</description>

      <title>Structures and proximity effects of inhomogeneous population-imbalanced Fermi gases with pairing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By introducing spatially varying profiles of pairing interaction or spin polarization to quasi one-dimensional two-component atomic Fermi gases confined in box potentials, we analyze the ground state structures and properties when multiple phases coexist in real space by implementing the Bogoliubov--de~Gennes equation suitable for describing inhomogeneous fermion systems. While the BCS, Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO), and normal phases occupy different regions on the phase diagram when the parameters are uniform, a spatial change of pairing strength or spin polarization can drive the system from the FFLO phase to a normal gas or from a BCS superfluid to the FFLO phase in real space. The FFLO phase exhibits its signature modulating order parameter at the FFLO momentum due to population imbalance, and the pair correlation penetrates the polarized normal phase and exhibits proximity effects. Meanwhile, the BCS phase tends to repel population imbalance and maintain a plateau of pairing. Interestingly, a buffer FFLO phase emerges when the spatial change attempts to join the BCS and normal phase in the presence of spin polarization. By analyzing the pairing correlations, interfacial properties, and momentum-space spectra of the inhomogeneous structures, relevant length- and momentum- scales and their interplay are characterized. We also briefly discuss implications of inhomogeneous multi-phase atomic Fermi gases with population imbalance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of a quantum field from a metastable state (false vacuum) to a stable one (true vacuum), also known as false vacuum decay, is a fundamental problem in quantum field theory and cosmology. We study this phenomenon using a two-dimensional interacting and coherently coupled Bose-Bose mixture, a platform that has already been employed experimentally to investigate false vacuum decay in one dimension. In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics. The decay rates show an exponential dependence on temperature, in line with the thermal theory of instantons. Since the SGPE is based on complex scalar fields, it also allows us to explore the behavior of the phase, which turns out to become dynamic during decay. Our results confirm the SGPE as an effective tool for studying coupled magnetization and phase dynamics and the associated instanton physics in ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Classical Benchmarks of a Symmetry-Adapted Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Real-Time Green's Functions in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03843</link>

Abstract: We present a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach for solving the Anderson Impurity Model (AIM) arising in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals.</description>

      <title>A Unified Categorical Description of Quantum Hall Hierarchy and Anyon Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified category-theoretic framework for quantum Hall hierarchy constructions and anyon superconductivity based on modular tensor categories over $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{U}(1))$ and $\mathrm{sRep}(\mathrm{U}(1)^f)$. Our approach explicitly incorporates conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge and formulates doping via a generalized stack-and-condense procedure, in which an auxiliary topological order is stacked onto the parent phase, and the quasiparticles created by doping subsequently condense. Depending on whether this condensation preserves or breaks the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry, the system undergoes a transition to a quantum Hall hierarchy state or to an anyon superconductor. For anyon superconductors, the condensate charge is determined unambiguously by the charged local bosons contained in the condensable algebra. Our framework reproduces all known anyon superconductors obtained from field-theoretic analyses and further predicts novel phases, including a charge-$2e$ anyon superconductor derived from the Laughlin state and charge-$ke$ anyon superconductors arising from bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_k$ Read-Rezayi states. By placing hierarchy transitions and anyon superconductivity within a single mathematical formalism, our work provides a unified understanding of competing and proximate phases near experimentally realizable fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Iterative optimization in quantum metrology and entanglement theory using semidefinite programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02820v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss efficient methods to optimize the metrological performance over local Hamiltonians in a bipartite quantum system. For a given quantum state, our methods find the best local Hamiltonian for which the state outperforms separable states the most from the point of view of quantum metrology. We show that this problem can be reduced to maximizing the quantum Fisher information over a certain set of Hamiltonians. We present the quantum Fisher information in a bilinear form and maximize it by an iterative see-saw (ISS) method, in which each step is based on semidefinite programming. We also solve the problem with the method of moments that works very well for smaller systems. Our approach is one of the efficient methods that can be applied for an optimization of the unitary dynamics in quantum metrology, the other methods being, for example, machine learning, variational quantum circuits, or neural networks. The advantage of our method is the fast and robust convergence due to the simple mathematical structure of the approach. We also consider a number of other problems in quantum information theory that can be solved in a similar manner. For instance, we determine the bound entangled quantum states that maximally violate the Computable Cross Norm-Realignment (CCNR) criterion.</description>

      <title>Classically Spoofing System Linear Cross Entropy Score Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several experimental groups have claimed demonstrations of ``quantum supremacy'' or computational quantum advantage. A notable first claim by Google Quantum AI revolves around a metric called the Linear Cross Entropy Benchmarking (Linear XEB), which has been used in many quantum supremacy experiments since. The complexity-theoretic hardness of spoofing Linear XEB, however, depends on the Cross-Entropy Quantum Threshold (XQUATH) conjecture put forth by Aaronson and Gunn, which has been disproven for sublinear depth circuits. In the efforts on demonstrating quantum supremacy by quantum Hamiltonian simulation, a similar benchmarking metric called the System Linear Cross Entropy Score (sXES) holds firm in light of the aforementioned negative result due to its fundamental distinction with Linear XEB. Moreover, the complexity-theoretic hardness of spoofing sXES rests on the System Linear Cross-Entropy Quantum Threshold Assumption (sXQUATH), the formal relationship of which to XQUATH is unclear. Despite the promises offered by sXES for future demonstration of quantum supremacy, in this work we show that it can be classically simulated efficiently in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Type II Fusion of Cluster States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement based quantum computation is a quantum computing paradigm that employs single-qubit measurements performed on an entangled resource state in the form of a cluster state. A basic ingredient in the construction of the resource state is the type-II fusion procedure, which probabilistically merges two separate photonic cluster states by a quantum measurement. We generalize the type-II fusion procedure by generalizing the measurement setup, and classify the resulting final states, which also include cluster states up to single-qubit rotations. We prove that the probability for the success of the generalized type-II fusion is bounded by fifty percent, and classify all the possibilities to saturate the bound. We analyze the enhancement of the fusion success probability above the fifty percent bound, by the reduction of the entanglement entropy of the resulting state. We prove that the only states that can be obtained with a hundred percent probability of success, are product states.</description>

      <title>A Search for High-Threshold Qutrit Magic State Distillation Routines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the best attainable threshold for qudit magic state distillation is directly related to the question of whether or not contextuality is sufficient for universal quantum computation. We show that the performance of a qudit correcting code for magic state distillation is captured by its complete weight enumerator. For the qutrit strange state -- a maximally magic non-stabilizer state -- the performance of a code is captured by its simple weight enumerator. This result allows us to carry out an extensive search for high-threshold magic state distillation routines for the strange state. Our search covers all $[[n,1]]_3$ qutrit stabilizer codes with a complete set of transversal Clifford gates for $n\leq 23$, and all $[[n,1]]_3$ stabilizer codes with a transversal $H^2$ gate with $n \leq 9$ qudits. For $n=23$, we find over 600 CSS codes that can distill the qutrit strange state with cubic noise suppression. While none of these codes surpass the threshold of the 11-qutrit Golay code, their existence suggests that, for large codes, the ability to distill the qutrit strange state is somewhat generic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing and quantum singular value transformation are powerful tools to implement polynomial transformations of block-encoded matrices on quantum computers, and has achieved asymptotically optimal complexity in many prominent quantum algorithms. We propose a framework of quantum signal processing and quantum singular value transformation on $U(N)$, which realizes multiple polynomials simultaneously from a block-encoded input, as a generalization of those on $U(2)$ in the original frameworks. We provide a comprehensive characterization of achievable polynomial matrices and give recursive algorithms to construct the quantum circuits that realize desired polynomial transformations. As three example applications, we propose a framework to realize bi-variate polynomial functions, demonstrate $N$-interval decision achieving $O(d)$ query complexity with a $\log_2 N$ improvement over iterative $U(2)$-QSP requiring $O(d\log_2 N)$ queries, and present a quantum amplitude estimation algorithm achieving the Heisenberg limit without adaptive measurements.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical model specifically designed for 3D multilayer devices, with a focus on nanobridge junctions and coplanar waveguides. Unlike existing numerical models, ours does not approximate the physical layout or limit the number of constituent materials, providing a more accurate and flexible design tool. We calculate critical currents, current phase relationships, and the energy gap where relevant. We validate our model by comparing it with published data. Through our analysis, we found that using multilayer films significantly enhances control over these quantities. For nanobridge junctions in particular, multilayer structures improve qubit anharmonicity compared to monolayer junctions, offering a substantial advantage for qubit performance. For coated multilayer microwave circuits it allows for better studies of the proximity effect, including their effective kinetic inductance.</description>

      <title>Spin Vector Potential as an Exact Solution of the Yang-Mills Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin vector potential, a gauge field generated by the intrinsic spin of a particle, has recently been proposed as a central element of spin Aharonov-Bohm effect. While its physical consequences have been explored, a fundamental and theoretical question remains: can it be systematically derived from a first-principle gauge theory? In this work, we prove that the spin vector potential $\vec{\mathcal{A}}= k (\vec{r} \times \vec{S})/{r^2}$, together with the Coulomb-type scalar potential $\varphi={\kappa}/{r}$, emerges as a new family of exact solutions to the non-Abelian Yang-Mills equations in vacuum. This solution, $\{\vec{\mathcal{A}}, \varphi\}$, describes a spin-dependent interaction that naturally reduces to the standard Coulomb interaction when spin effects are neglected. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Schr{\" o}dinger and Dirac equations incorporating this spin-dependent Coulomb interaction can be solved exactly. Our work not only provides a rigorous gauge-theoretical foundation for the previously proposed spin vector potential, but also establishes a direct link between spin physics and the Yang-Mills gauge theory. This opens new perspectives for understanding spin-dependent interactions, designing spin-dependent quantum phases, and exploring spin-mediated forces in quantum physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open Quantum Brownian Motion (OQBM) is a new class of quantum Brownian motion in which the dynamics of the Brownian particle depend not only on interactions with a thermal environment but also on the state of its internal degrees of freedom. For an Ohmic bath spectral density with a Lorentz-Drude cutoff frequency at a high-temperature limit, we derive the Born-Markov master equation for the reduced density matrix of an open Brownian particle in a harmonic potential. The resulting master equation is written in phase-space representation using the Wigner function, and due to the separation of associated timescales in the high-damping limit, we perform adiabatic elimination of the momentum variable to obtain OQBM. We numerically solve the derived master equation for the reduced density matrix of the OQBM for Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial distributions. In each case, the OQBM dynamics converge to several Gaussian distributions. To gain physical insight into the studied system, we also plotted the dynamics of the off-diagonal element of the open quantum Brownian particle and found damped coherent oscillations. Finally, we investigated the time-dependent variance in the position of the OQBM walker and observed a transition between ballistic and diffusive behavior.</description>

      <title>Parallelized Givens Ansatz for Molecular ground-states: Bridging Accuracy and Efficiency on NISQ Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as one of the most popular algorithms for solving the electronic structure problem on near-term quantum computers. The utility of VQE is often hindered by the limitations of current quantum hardware, including short qubit coherence times and low gate fidelities. These limitations become particularly pronounced when VQE is used along with deep quantum circuits, such as those required by the "Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles" (UCCSD) ansatz, often resulting in significant errors. To address these issues, we propose a low-depth ansatz based on parallelized Givens rotations, which can recover substantial correlation energy while drastically reducing circuit depth and two-qubit gate counts for an arbitrary active space (AS). Also, considering the current hardware architectures with low qubit counts, we introduce a systematic way to select molecular orbitals to define active spaces (ASs) that retain significant electron correlation. We validate our approach by computing bond dissociation profiles of water and strongly correlated systems, such as molecular nitrogen and oxygen, across various ASs. Noiseless simulations using the new ansatz yield ground-state energies comparable to those from the UCCSD ansatz while reducing circuit depth by 50-70%. Moreover, in noisy simulations, our approach achieves energy error rates an order of magnitude lower than that of UCCSD. Considering the efficiency and practical usage of our ansatz, we hope that it becomes a potential choice for performing quantum chemistry calculations on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A Cautionary Note on Quantum Oracles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the quantum oracle model introduced by Aaronson and Kuperberg (2007) has found a lot of use in showing oracle separations between complexity classes and cryptographic primitives. It is generally assumed that proof techniques that do not relativize with respect to quantum oracles will also not relativize with respect to classical oracles. In this note, we show that this is not the case: specifically, we show that there is a quantum oracle problem that is contained in the class QMA, but not in a class we call polyQCPH. The class polyQCPH is equal to PSPACE with respect to classical oracles, and it is a well-known result that QMA is contained in PSPACE (also with respect to classical oracles).
  We also show that the same separation holds relative to a distributional oracle, which is a model introduced by Natarajan and Nirkhe (2024). We believe our findings show the need for some caution when using these non-standard oracle models, particularly when showing separations between quantum and classical resources.</description>

Abstract: While 2-level systems, aka qubits, are a natural choice to perform a logical quantum computation, the situation is less clear at the physical level. Encoding information in higher-dimensional physical systems can indeed provide a first level of redundancy and error correction that simplifies the overall fault-tolerant architecture. A challenge then is to ensure universal control over the encoded qubits. Here, we explore an approach where information is encoded in an irreducible representation of a finite subgroup of $U(2)$ through an inverse quantum Fourier transform. We illustrate this idea by applying it to the real Pauli group $\langle X, Z\rangle$ in the bosonic setting. The resulting two-mode Fourier cat code displays good error correction properties and admits an experimentally-friendly universal gate set that we discuss in detail.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate entanglement between the polarization of an infrared photon and a metastable $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion qubit. This entanglement persists after transmitting the photon over a $2.8\:$km long commercial fiber deployed in an urban environment. Tomography of the ion-photon entangled state yields a fidelity of $0.949(4)$ within the laboratory and $0.929(5)$ after fiber transmission, not corrected for readout errors. Our results establish the Strontium ion as a promising candidate for metropolitan-scale quantum networking based on an atomic transition at $1092\:$nm, a wavelength compatible with existing telecom fiber infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Robust Tripartite Entanglement Generation via Correlated Noise in Spin Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We suggest a protocol for the sympathetic cooling of a molecular asymmetric top rotor co-trapped with laser-cooled atomic ions, based on resonant coupling between the molecular ion's electric dipole moment and a common normal mode of the trapped particles. By combining sympathetic sideband laser cooling with coherent microwave excitation, we demonstrate the efficient depopulation of arbitrary rotational subspaces and the ability to cool an incoherent distribution of rotational states into a single, well-defined quantum state. This capability opens the door to exploiting the rotational Hilbert space for applications in quantum information processing and high-precision spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that offers ease of training compared to other quantum neural networks, as it does not rely on gradient-based optimization. Learning is performed in a single step on the output features measured from the quantum system. Various implementations of quantum reservoir computing have been explored in simulations, with different measured features. Although simulations have shown that quantum reservoirs present advantages in performance compared to classical reservoirs, experimental implementations have remained scarce. This is due to the challenge of obtaining a large number of output features that are nonlinear transformations of the input data. In this work, we show that even with a circuit quantum electrodynamics system as simple as a single transmon coupled to a readout resonator, we can implement a proof-of-concept realization of quantum reservoir computing. We obtain a large number of nonlinear features from a single physical system by encoding the input data in the amplitude of a coherent drive and measuring the cavity state in the Fock basis. We demonstrate classification of two classical tasks with significantly smaller hardware resources and fewer measured features compared to classical neural networks. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations that show additional Kerr nonlinearity is beneficial to reservoir performance. Our work demonstrates a hardware-efficient quantum neural network implementation that can be further scaled up and generalized to other quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08418v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.</description>

      <title>Neural network for excess noise estimation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution under composable finite-size security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation is a critical step in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), especially in the finite-size regime where worst-case confidence intervals can significantly reduce the achievable secret-key rate. We provide a finite-size security analysis demonstrating that neural networks can be reliably employed for parameter estimation in CV-QKD with quantifiable failure probabilities $\epsilon_{PE}$, endowed with an operational interpretation and composable security guarantees. Using a protocol that is operationally equivalent to standard approaches, our method produces significantly tighter confidence intervals, unlocking higher key rates even under collective Gaussian attacks. The proposed approach yields tighter confidence intervals, leading to a quantifiable increase in the secret-key rate under collective Gaussian attacks. These results open up new perspectives for integrating modern machine learning techniques into quantum cryptographic protocols, particularly in practical resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the role of overparametrization in Quantum Approximate Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary quantum algorithms research. While they have demonstrated considerable promise in solving problems of practical interest, efficiently determining the minimal quantum resources necessary to obtain such a solution remains an open question. In this work, inspired by concepts from classical machine learning, we investigate the impact of overparameterization on the performance of variational algorithms. Our study focuses on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- a prominent variational quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We investigate if circuit overparametrization is necessary and sufficient to solve such problems in QAOA, considering two representative problems -- MAX-CUT and MAX-2-SAT. For MAX-CUT we observe that overparametriation is both sufficient and (statistically) necessary for attaining exact solutions, as confirmed numerically for up to $20$ qubits. In fact, for MAX-CUT on 2-regular graphs we show the necessity to be exact, based on the analytically found optimal depth. In sharp contrast, for MAX-2-SAT, underparametrized circuits suffice to solve most instances. This result highlights the potential of QAOA in the underparametrized regime, supporting its utility for current noisy devices.</description>

      <title>The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in forecasting both linear and nonlinear time-series depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average -- up to a threshold in the input frequency -- that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Far-Field Quantum Coherence by Dielectric Bodies Based on the Volume Integral Equation Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is a hallmark of nonclassical two-photon interference. This paper develops a unified theory-numerics framework to compute angle-resolved far-field two-photon correlations from arbitrary lossless dielectric scatterers. We describe the input-output relation using a multi-channel scattering formulation that maps two populated incident channels to two selected far-field detection modes, yielding a compact two-channel transfer relation for second-order correlation function and time-domain coincidence counts. The required transfer coefficients are extracted from classical far-field complex amplitudes computed by an fast Fourier transform-accelerated volume integral equation solver, avoiding perfectly matched layers and near-to-far-field post-processing. The method is validated against analytical results for dielectric spheres and demonstrated on a polarization-converting Pancharatnam-Berry-phase metasurface, revealing strong angular dependence of quantum interference and its direct impact on HOM-dip visibility. The framework provides an efficient and physically transparent tool for structure-dependent quantum-correlation analysis, with potential applications in scatterers-enabled quantum state engineering and quantum inverse design.</description>

      <title>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</description>

      <title>A New Quantum Linear System Algorithm Beyond the Condition Number and Its Application to Solving Multivariate Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a matrix $A$ of dimension $M \times N$ and a vector $\vec{b}$, the quantum linear system (QLS) problem asks for the preparation of a quantum state $|\vec{y}\rangle$ proportional to the solution of $A\vec{y} = \vec{b}$. Existing QLS algorithms have runtimes that scale linearly with the condition number $\kappa(A)$, the sparsity of $A$, and logarithmically with inverse precision, but often overlook structural properties of $\vec{b}$, whose alignment with $A$'s eigenspaces can greatly affect performance.
  In this work, we present a new QLS algorithm that explicitly leverages the structure of the right-hand side vector $\vec{b}$. The runtime of our algorithm depends polynomially on the sparsity of the augmented matrix $H = [A, -\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter \[ ET= \sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2 \cdot d_i, \] where $\vec{p} = (AA^{\top})^+ \vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the squared $\ell_2$ norm of the $i$-th row of $H$. We also introduce a structure-aware rescaling technique tailored to the solution $\vec{y} = A^+ \vec{b}$. Unlike left preconditioning methods, which transform the linear system to $DA\vec{y} = D\vec{b}$, our approach applies a right rescaling matrix, reformulating the linear system as $AD\vec{z} = \vec{b}$.
  As an application of our instance-aware QLS algorithm and new rescaling scheme, we develop a quantum algorithm for solving multivariate polynomial systems in regimes where prior QLS-based methods fail. This yields an end-to-end framework applicable to a broad class of problems. In particular, we apply it to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, formulated as a special case of a polynomial system, and show through detailed analysis that, under certain conditions, our quantum algorithm for MIS runs in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Filtering and Analysis of Multiplicities in Eigenvalue Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained spectral properties of quantum Hamiltonians, including both eigenvalues and their multiplicities, provide useful information for characterizing many-body quantum systems as well as for understanding phenomena such as topological order. Extracting such information with small additive error is $\#\textsf{BQP}$-complete in the worst case. In this work, we introduce QFAMES (Quantum Filtering and Analysis of Multiplicities in Eigenvalue Spectra), a quantum algorithm that efficiently identifies clusters of closely spaced dominant eigenvalues and determines their multiplicities under physically motivated assumptions, which allows us to bypass worst-case complexity barriers. QFAMES also enables the estimation of observable expectation values within targeted energy clusters, providing a powerful tool for studying quantum phase transitions and other physical properties. We validate the effectiveness of QFAMES through numerical demonstrations, including its applications to characterizing quantum phases in the transverse-field Ising model and estimating the ground-state degeneracy of a topologically ordered phase in the two-dimensional toric code model. We also generalize QFAMES to the setting of mixed initial states. Our approach offers rigorous theoretical guarantees and significant advantages over existing subspace-based quantum spectral analysis methods, particularly in terms of the sample complexity and the ability to resolve degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Generating Entangled Steady States in Multistable Open Quantum Systems via Initial State Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement underpins the power of quantum technologies, yet it is fragile and typically destroyed by dissipation. Paradoxically, the same dissipation, when carefully engineered, can drive a system toward robust entangled steady states. However, this engineering task is nontrivial, as dissipative many-body systems are complex, particularly when they support multiple steady states. Here, we derive analytic expressions that predict how the steady state of a system evolving under a Lindblad equation depends on the initial state, without requiring integration of the dynamics. These results extend the frameworks developed in Refs. [Phys. Rev. A 89, 022118 (2014) and Phys. Rev. X 6, 041031 (2016)], showing that while the steady-state manifold is determined by the Liouvillian kernel, the weights within it depend on both the Liouvillian and the initial state. We identify a special class of Liouvillians for which the steady state depends only on the initial overlap with the kernel. Our framework provides analytical insight and a computationally efficient tool for predicting steady states in open quantum systems. As an application, we propose schemes to generate metrologically useful entangled steady states in spin ensembles via balanced collective decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear and resonant process of two-photon ionization of atoms (He and H) in a pump-probe scheme. The pump pulse prepares the quantum system in a superposition of the ground state and an excited bound state. By varying the phase difference between the pulses, we show how it is possible to coherently control the dressed-state population during the probe pulse. Our main result is that for certain laser parameters, the control over the dressed state population leads to strong control of the ionization probability during the probe pulse. The effect arises due to one of the dressed states becoming stabilized against ionization. Contrasting effects from circular and linear polarized pulses demonstrate how such ``bound states in the continuum'' are sensitive to the degeneracy of the coupled continuum.</description>

      <title>Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Photon Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We second quantize the Fermi Lagrangian in the Lorenz gauge to obtain a covariant theory of photon quantum mechanics. Number density is real so it is interpreted as position probability density. The Hilbert space is the vector space of fields with norm 1 describing physical photons and the Poincare operators are extended to include position to represent observables. A photon continuity equation is derived that describes creation, propagation and annihilation of photons in an optical circuit. The relationship to orthodox quantum mechanics is discussed.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum error-correcting codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework, which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces Z-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA, a multi-agent research assistant platform where agents collaborate in a shared LaTeX-Python workspace synchronized with Git/Overleaf. Three specialized agents formulate constraints, sweep and screen candidate codes, exactify numerical solutions into rationals, and independently audit all KL equalities and induced logical actions. Focusing on distance-two codes with nondegenerate residues, we catalogue new nonadditive codes for dimensions $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ on up to six qubits, including high-order diagonal transversals, yielding $14,116$ new codes. From these data, the system abstracts closed-form families and constructs a residue-degenerate $((6,4,2))$ code implementing a transversal controlled-phase $\mathrm{diag}(1,1,1,i)$, illustrating how AI orchestration can drive rigorous, scalable code discovery.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Ordering and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum differential privacy (QDP) by defining a notion of the order of informativeness between pairs of quantum states. In particular, we show that if the hypothesis testing divergence of one pair dominates over that of the other pair, then this dominance holds for every $f$-divergence. This approach completely characterizes $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-QDP mechanisms by identifying the most informative $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP quantum state pairs. We apply this to study precise limits for privatized hypothesis testing and privatized quantum parameter estimation, including tight upper-bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that charge teleportation serves as a superior observable for Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET)-based cryptographic primitives. While following the LOCC protocol structure of earlier proposals, we show that decoding key bits via local charge rather than energy provides exact bit symmetry and enhanced robustness: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

      <title>Noise-Induced Equalization in quantum learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum noise is known to strongly affect quantum computation, thus potentially limiting the performance of currently available quantum processing units. Even learning models based on variational quantum algorithms, which were designed to cope with the limitations of state-of-the art noisy hardware capabilities, are affected by noise-induced barren plateaus, arising when the noise level becomes too strong. However, the generalization performances of such quantum machine learning algorithms can also be positively influenced by a proper level of noise, despite its generally detrimental effects. Here, we propose a pre-training procedure to determine the quantum noise level leading to desirable optimisation landscape properties. We show that an optimized level of quantum noise induces an ``equalization'' of the directions in the Riemannian manifold, flattening(/enhancing) the initially steep(/shallow) ones by redistributing sensitivity across its principal eigen-directions. We analyse this noise-induced equalization through the lens of the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, thus providing a recipe that allows to estimate the noise level inducing the strongest equalization. We finally benchmark these conclusions with extensive numerical simulations providing evidence of the beneficial noise effects in the neighborhood of the best equalization, often leading to improved generalization.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel tomography and estimation by local test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the estimation of an unknown quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$ with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. We establish a connection between the query complexities in two models: (i) access to $\mathcal{E}$, and (ii) access to a random dilation of $\mathcal{E}$. Specifically, we show that for parallel (possibly coherent) testers, access to dilations does not help. This is proved by constructing a local tester that uses $n$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ yet faithfully simulates the tester with $n$ queries to a random dilation. As application, we show that:
  - $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$.
  Moreover, when $rd_2=d_1$, we show that the Heisenberg scaling $O(1/\varepsilon)$ can be achieved, even if $\mathcal{E}$ is not a unitary channel:
  - $O(\min\{d_1^{2.5}/\varepsilon,d_1^2/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$, and $O(d_1^2/\varepsilon)$ queries suffice for the case of Choi state trace norm error $\varepsilon$.
  - $O(\min\{d_1^{1.5}/\varepsilon,d_1/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for tomography of the mixed state $\mathcal{E}(|0\rangle\langle 0|)$ to within trace norm error $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Solving nonlinear PDEs with Quantum Neural Networks: A variational approach to the Bratu Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to solve the nonlinear one-dimensional Bratu equation. By formulating the boundary value problem within a variational framework and encoding the solution in a parameterized quantum neural network (QNN), the problem reduces to an optimization task over quantum circuit parameters. The trial solution incorporates a predictor from the previous continuation step and boundary-enforcing terms, allowing the circuit to focus on minimizing the residual of the differential operator. Using a noiseless quantum simulator, we demonstrate that the method accurately captures both solution branches of the Bratu equation and shows excellent agreement with classical pseudo arc-length continuation results.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Low Resolution Control Electronics on Quantum Neural Network Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers requires tight integration of cryogenic control electronics with quantum processors, where Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) face severe power and area constraints. We investigate quantum neural network (QNN) training and inference under finite DAC resolution constraints, evaluating two QNN architectures across four diverse datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Iris, Breast Cancer). Pre-trained QNNs achieve accuracy nearly indistinguishable from infinite-precision baselines when deployed on quantum systems with 6-bit DAC control electronics, exhibiting characteristic elbow curves with diminishing returns beyond 3-5 bits depending on the dataset. However, training QNNs directly under quantization constraints reveals gradient deadlock below 12-bit resolution, where parameter updates fall below quantization step sizes, preventing training entirely. We introduce temperature-controlled stochastic quantization that overcomes this limitation through probabilistic parameter updates, enabling successful training at 4-10 bit resolutions. Remarkably, stochastic quantization not only matches but frequently exceeds infinite-precision baseline performance across both architectures and all datasets. Our findings demonstrate that low-resolution control electronics (4-10 bits) need not compromise QML performance while enabling substantial power and area reduction in cryogenic control systems, presenting significant implications for practical quantum hardware scaling and hardware-software co-design of QML systems.</description>

      <title>Criteria on quantum fluctuations of vacuum and photons influence in Spontaneous-Parametric Down-Conversion and Four-Wave-Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a theoretical and quantitative exploration of the limit regarding the pump intensity between the two regimes of spontaneous-parametric down-conversion (SPDC) as well as of four-wave-mixing (FWM) in the framework of a semi-classical model and analytical calculations. A dimensionless parameter has been defined at this limit, corresponding to the photon-pairs flux per frequency unit: it has been found equal to 0.369. The ratio between the electric field of the generated photons and the quantum fluctuations of vacuum calculated at the limit is equal to 1.718. These quantitative results confirm that below the limit, the pump photon splitting leading to photon-pairs can be considered as spontaneous, i.e. mainly seeded by the quantum fluctuations of vacuum, while it is stimulated by the generated signal and idler photons above the limit, which corresponds to an optical parametric amplification regime. Our calculations also show that this limit can be easily reached in the case of SPDC according to the typical values of non-linearities and available crystal dimensions. In the case of FWM, it would be only possible in kilometric optical fibers. This corpus is a useful tool box for designing further quantum experiments performed from either side of the limit, as well as at the limit it-self where the influence of the quantum fluctuations of vacuum and of the generated photons should have the same weight. Furthermore, the quantum significance of the numerical values of the two criteria defined here remains to be established, which should motivate future theoretical quantum studies.</description>

      <title>Will we ever quantize the center of mass of macroscopic systems? A case for a Heisenberg cut in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of quantum particles derives from quantum field theory. Accepting that quantum mechanics is valid all the way implies that not only composite particles (such as protons and neutrons) would be derived from a field theory, but also the center of mass of bodies as heavy as rocks. Despite the fabulous success of quantum mechanics, it is unreasonable to assume the existence of annihilation and creation operators for rocks, and so on. Fortunately, there are strong reasons to doubt that wave mechanics can describe the center of mass of systems at or above the Planck scale, thereby jeopardizing the construction of the corresponding Fock space. As a result, systems with masses exceeding the Planck mass would have their center of mass described through classical mechanics, regardless of being able to harbor macroscopic quantum phenomena as observed in the laboratory. Here, we briefly revisit (i) the arguments for the need for a Heisenberg cut delimitating the boundary between the quantum and classical realms and (ii) the kind of new physics expected at (the uncharted region of) the Heisenberg cut.''</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of quantum circuit fidelity across the full compilation stack, from high-level gate optimization through pulse-level control. Using a modular integration framework connecting a C++ circuit optimizer with Lindblad-based pulse simulation, we systematically evaluate the fidelity impact of four optimization passes: gate cancellation, commutation, rotation merging, and identity elimination, on IQM Garnet hardware parameters. Our simulation campaign spanning 371 circuit runs reveals that gate cancellation provides the most significant improvement (68\% of circuits improved, 14,024 gates eliminated), while pulse duration exhibits the strongest negative correlation with process fidelity ($r = -0.74$, $R^2 = 0.55$). We validate these findings through hardware execution on the IQM Resonance Garnet 20-qubit processor, demonstrating 70\% gate reduction on QFT circuits with 100\% job success rate (8 executions). Our open-source framework enables reproducible benchmarking of quantum compilation pipelines.</description>

      <title>Dicke superposition probes for noise-resilient Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase sensing with entangled multiqubit states in the presence of noise is a central theme of modern quantum metrology. The present work investigates Dicke state superposition probes for quantum phase sensing under parameter encoding generated by one- and two-body interaction Hamiltonians. A class of N-qubit Dicke superposition states that exhibit near-Heisenberg scaling, of the quantum Fisher information, while maintaining significantly enhanced robustness to dephasing noise compared to GHZ, W-superposition, and balanced Dicke states, under unitary encodings generated by one-body interaction Hamiltonians are identified. For two-body interactions, Dicke superposition probes optimizing the quantum Fisher information are identified, and their performance under phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and global depolarizing noise is explored. Within this family, certain Dicke superpositions are found to combine super-Heisenberg scaling with improved resilience to phase damping relative to Fisher information optimal probes. These results establish tailored near-optimal Dicke-state superposition probes as versatile and noise-resilient resources for Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg quantum phase sensing governed by one- and two-body interactions.</description>

      <title>From Block Diagrams to Bloch Spheres: Graphical Quantum Circuit Simulation in LabVIEW</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing transitions from theoretical physics to engineering applications, there is a growing need for accessible simulation tools that bridge the gap between abstract linear algebra and practical implementation. While text-based frameworks (like Qiskit or Cirq) are standard, they often present a steep learning curve for students and engineers accustomed to graphical system design. This paper introduces QuVI (Quantum Virtual Instrument), an open-source quantum circuit toolkit developed natively within the NI LabVIEW environment. Moving beyond initial proof-of-concept models, QuVI establishes a robust framework that leverages LabVIEW's "dataflow" paradigm, in which wires represent data and nodes represent operations, to provide an intuitive, visual analog to standard quantum circuit notation while enabling the seamless integration of classical control structures like loops and conditionals. The toolkit's capabilities are demonstrated by constructing and visualizing fundamental quantum algorithms and verifying results against theoretical predictions. By translating "Block Diagrams" directly into quantum state evolutions ("Bloch Spheres"), QuVI offers educators and researchers a powerful platform for prototyping quantum logic without leaving the graphical engineering workspace.</description>

      <title>Noise-Resilient Quantum Chemistry with Half the Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) offers a powerful route to accurate quantum chemistry on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices by combining quantum sampling with classical diagonalization. Here we introduce HSQD, a novel half-qubit SQD approach that halves the qubit requirement for simulating a chemical system and drastically reduces overall circuit depth and gate counts, suppressing hardware noise. When modeling the dissociation of the nitrogen molecule with a (10e, 26o) active space, HSQD matches the accuracy of SQD on IBM quantum hardware using only half the number of qubits and 40% fewer measurements.
  We further enhance HSQD with a heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI) inspired selection of the samples, forming HCI-HSQD. This yields sub-millihartree accuracy across the N2 potential energy surface and produces subspaces up to 39% smaller than those from classical HCI, showing a significant improvement in the compactness of the ground-state representation.
  Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of HCI-HSQD using iron-sulfur clusters, reaching active spaces of up to (54e, 36o) while using only half as many qubits as the original SQD. For these systems, HCI-HSQD reduces SQD energy errors by up to 76% for [2Fe-2S] and 26% for [4Fe-4S], while also reducing subspace sizes, halving measurement requirements, and eliminating expensive post-processing.
  Together, these results establish half-qubit SQD as a noise-resilient and resource-efficient pathway toward practical quantum advantage in strongly correlated chemistry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on a dissipative two-level atom in the weak-field regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative dynamics of a two-level atom in a weak gravitational field. Using the Feynman--Vernon influence functional formalism, we derive a quantum master equation describing the two-level atom interacting with a scalar field in a Newtonian gravitational field, and compute the energy dissipation rate of the atom. We find that the spontaneous emission rate (the dissipation rate in vacuum) is modified by the gravitational field. Specifically, this modification depends on the atom's dipole, the position of the atom relative to the source of the gravitational field, and the frequency of the scalar radiation emitted by the atom. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regimes in which the spontaneous emission rate is enhanced or suppressed by gravity. We also discuss how the modification arises from time dilation and dipole radiation in a weak gravitational field. These findings provide a theoretical basis for exploring gravitational effects in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Learning Advantage Under Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry underlies many of the most effective classical and quantum learning algorithms, yet whether quantum learners can gain a fundamental advantage under symmetry-imposed structures remains an open question. Based on evidence that classical statistical query ($\SQ$) frameworks have revealed exponential query complexity in learning symmetric function classes, we ask: can quantum learning algorithms exploit the problem symmetry better? In this work, we investigate the potential benefits of symmetry within the quantum statistical query ($\QSQ$) model, which is a natural quantum analog of classical $\SQ$. Our results uncover three distinct phenomena: (i) we obtain an exponential separation between $\QSQ$ and $\SQ$ on a permutation-invariant function class; (ii) we establish query complexity lower bounds for $\QSQ$ learning that match, up to constant factors, the corresponding classical $\SQ$ lower bounds for most commonly studied symmetries; however, the potential advantages may occur under highly skewed orbit distributions; and (iii) we further identify a tolerance-based separation exists, where quantum learners succeed at noise levels that render classical $\SQ$ algorithms ineffective. Together, these findings provide insight into when symmetry can enable quantum advantage in learning.</description>

      <title>Optimal displacement detection of arbitrarily-shaped levitated dielectric objects using optical radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optically-levitated dielectric objects are promising for precision force, acceleration, torque, and rotation sensing due to their extreme environmental decoupling. While many levitated opto-mechanics experiments employ spherical objects, for some applications non-spherical geometries offer advantages. For example, rod-shaped or dumbbell shaped particles have been demonstrated for torque and rotation sensing and high aspect ratio plate-like particles can exhibit reduced photon recoil heating and may be useful for high-frequency gravitational wave detection or as high bandwidth accelerometers. To achieve optimal sensitivity, cooling, and quantum control in these systems, it is beneficial to achieve optimal displacement detection using scattered light. We describe and numerically implement a method based on Fisher information that is applicable to suspended particles of arbitrary geometry. We demonstrate the agreement between our method and prior methods employed for spherical particles, both in the Rayleigh and Lorentz-Mie regimes. As practical examples we analyze the optical detection limits of an optically-levitated high-aspect-ratio disc-like dielectric object and a rod-shaped object for configurations recently realized in experimental work.</description>

      <title>MetaSym: A Symplectic Meta-learning Framework for Physical Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable and generalizable physics-aware deep learning has long been considered a significant challenge with various applications across diverse domains ranging from robotics to molecular dynamics. Central to almost all physical systems are symplectic forms, the geometric backbone that underpins fundamental invariants like energy and momentum. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, MetaSym. In particular, MetaSym combines a strong symplectic inductive bias obtained from a symplectic encoder, and an autoregressive decoder with meta-attention. This principled design ensures that core physical invariants remain intact, while allowing flexible, data efficient adaptation to system heterogeneities. We benchmark MetaSym with highly varied and realistic datasets, such as a high-dimensional spring-mesh system Otness et al. (2021), an open quantum system with dissipation and measurement backaction, and robotics-inspired quadrotor dynamics. Crucially, we fine-tune and deploy MetaSym on real-world quadrotor data, demonstrating robustness to sensor noise and real-world uncertainty. Across all tasks, MetaSym achieves superior few-shot adaptation and outperforms larger state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of Chern polarization via crystalline defect charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to systems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example. Defining polarization for them is complicated because they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states. Wannier functions formed a key ingredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been considered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no longer exponentially localized and the Wannier center, obtained from the Zak phase, is no longer gauge invariant. In this article, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute polarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our expression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations. Our expression can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no assumption on the edge state filling. It is fully consistent with previous results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence of crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it also applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other than translations.</description>

      <title>Gauging Modulated Symmetries via Multiple Gauge Symmetry Operators and Adaptive Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extended framework for the simultaneous gauging of modulated symmetries in $(d+1)$ dimensions, employing {\it multiple} gauge symmetry operators whose corresponding gauging procedures must be carried out simultaneously. Simultaneous gauging can capture a broader class of dualities than sequential gauging, the latter corresponding to the conventional gauging applied in successive steps. In general, performing simultaneous gauging and conventional gauging in sequence constitutes the most general framework for gauging modulated symmetries. We further show that the associated duality transformations can be implemented via adaptive state preparation protocols. As a concrete example, we consider a dipole symmetry in $(2+1)$D and illustrate both the simultaneous gauging procedure and the adaptive preparation protocol. Interestingly, we find that the intermediate state of the simultaneous gauging/adaptive circuit corresponds to a symmetry-protected topological phase protected by the dipole bundle symmetry. Finally, we utilize the duality to analyze the phase diagram of the rank-2 toric code under transverse fields.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Universal Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hoeffding's formulation and solution to the universal hypothesis testing (UHT) problem had a profound impact on many subsequent works dealing with asymmetric hypotheses. In this work, we introduce a quantum universal hypothesis testing framework that serves as a quantum analog to Hoeffding's UHT. Motivated by Hoeffding's approach, which estimates the empirical distribution and uses it to construct the test statistic, we employ quantum state tomography to reconstruct the unknown state prior to forming the test statistic. Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular and strongly walk-regular graphs that admit perfect state transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study perfect state transfer in Grover walks on two important classes of graphs: strongly regular graphs and strongly walk-regular graphs. The latter class is a generalization of the former. We first give a complete classification of strongly regular graphs that admit perfect state transfer. The only such graphs are the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,2}$ and the complete tripartite graph $K_{2,2,2}$. We then show that, if a connected strongly walk-regular graph that is not a strongly regular graph admits perfect state transfer, then its spectrum must be of the form $\{[k]^1, [\frac{k}{2}]^{\alpha}, [0]^{\beta}, [-\frac{k}{2}]^{\gamma}\}$, and we enumerate all feasible spectra of this form up to $k=20$ with the help of a computer. These results are obtained using techniques from algebraic number theory and spectral graph theory, particularly through the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenprojections of a normalized adjacency matrix. While the setting is in quantum walks, the core discussion is developed entirely within the framework of spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Ultracoherent self-assembled diamond nanomechanics reveals superfluid dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From gravitational-wave detection, protein force microscopy, to exploration of quantum-classical boundaries, many anticipated discoveries in fundamental science require improving measurement sensitivity limits. Through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, mechanical dissipation sets the acoustic noise for this limit. Yet, even in high-purity crystals, the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the acoustic loss remain poorly understood. Tension-induced dissipation dilution offers a route to ultralow acoustic loss, but is challenging to implement in crystalline materials including single-crystal diamond. Here we realize a strain-engineered diamond nanomechanical platform using a liquid-assisted van der Waals self-assembly process that harnesses intrinsic surface forces to apply tensile stress exceeding 1 GPa. At cryogenic temperatures these resonators achieve quality factors beyond 10 billion (intrinsic material quality factors beyond 100 million). This exceptional coherence turns them into a sensitive probe for residual dissipation, elucidating three distinct two-level-system channels and one topological dissipation channel from a surface superfluid helium film. Our work shows how advancing mechanical coherence opens access to new regimes of physics in hybrid quantum systems, precision metrology, and condensed-matter physics.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dynamics of vortex particles in accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments with spin-polarized beams of leptons and hadrons typically employ plane-wave states with definite momenta and energies. In contrast, vortex states represent cylindrical waves carrying a well-defined orbital angular momentum projection along the propagation direction. This projection can be arbitrarily large, endowing such particles with magnetic moments orders of magnitude greater than those of plane-wave states. Consequently, vortex particles could complement - or even replace - spin-polarized beams in high-energy collisions, enabling access to observables beyond the reach of the conventional states. Although relativistic vortex beams have yet to be realized, we investigate the radiative and non-radiative dynamics of angular momentum for vortex particles in accelerators. We compute the timescale for angular momentum loss via photon emission, finding it significantly longer than typical acceleration times. The non-radiative dynamics is governed by precession, with the orbital angular momentum precessing at a frequency markedly different from that of spin. Similar to spin tunes in circular accelerators, this can induce resonances that disrupt the beam's orbital momentum - occurring far more frequently for vortex beams than for spin-polarized ones. Thus, vortex particle acceleration can be more feasible in linacs, while Siberian snakes could serve as a tool for angular momentum manipulations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of linear eigenvalue problems depending on a small parameter epsilon in which the series expansion for the eigenvalue in powers of epsilon is divergent. We develop a new technique to determine the precise nature of this divergence. We illustrate the technique through its application to four examples: the anharmonic oscillator, a simplified model of equatorially-trapped Rossby waves, and two simplified models based on quasinormal modes of Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution of the single-particle Schr\"odinger equation for a chain of non-interacting fermions subject to a time-dependent linear potential, with its slope varied as an arbitrary function of time. The resulting dynamics exhibit self-similar behavior, with a structure reminiscent of the domain wall melting problem, albeit characterized by a nontrivial time-dependent length scale and phase. Building on this solution, we derive hydrodynamic predictions for the evolution of particle density, current, and entanglement entropy along the chain. In the special case of a sudden quench, the system develops a breathing interface region, which may be interpreted as a realization of Wannier-Stark localization, as previously suggested on the basis of hydrodynamic arguments.</description>

      <title>A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Structural Analysis of Trilayers for Tantalum Josephson Junctions with Ta$_2$O$_5$ Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which may host fewer two-level system (TLS) defects, which are the key contributors to decoherence in superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide remains the predominant choice for Josephson junction (JJ) barriers in most qubit architectures. Here, we investigate techniques for forming high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum films to develop tantalum-oxide JJ barriers. We explore thermal oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, and plasma oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, characterize the resulting structures using X-ray techniques and electron microscopy, and propose a mechanistic picture of the oxidation pathways. We find that plasma oxidation provides the smoothest Ta$_2$O$_5$ layers, is compatible with in situ Ta deposition, and offers thickness control through the annealing temperature, advantageous for JJ fabrication. Lastly, we evaluate methods for growing Ta/TaO$_x$/Ta trilayers. All trilayers showed c-axis-oriented columnar growth of the bottom Ta layer, with sapphire substrates producing larger, better-aligned grains yet higher dislocation densities than silicon. Nucleation of c-axis-oriented $\alpha$-Ta on tantalum-oxide required an Nb seed layer, as direct Ta deposition yielded amorphous Ta. These results demonstrate the feasibility of $\alpha$-Ta/Nb/TaO$_x$/$\alpha$-Ta stacks for JJs with clean interfaces.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>
