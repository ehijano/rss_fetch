      <title>Phase-field and lip-field approaches for fracture with extreme mesh deformation (X-Mesh): a one-dimensional study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional fracture problem modelled using either the phase-field or lip-field approach. In both cases, we optimise the incremental potential with respect to the displacement and damage fields and the nodal coordinates of the mesh. This is thus a variational mesh study. We observe that, as the damage reaches its maximum value, the optimisation drives the most damaged element to zero size as the damage reaches its maximum value. This peculiar element provides a precise displacement jump representation as the bar breaks. The overall solution is also shown to be much more accurate than the fixed mesh solution. This work forms part of an exploration into the capabilities of extreme meshes in computational mechanics (X-Mesh).</description>

      <title>Deep Inverse Rosenblatt Transport for Structural Reliability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the probability of failure in engineering systems under uncertainty is a fundamental challenge, particularly in high-dimensional settings and for rare events. Conventional reliability analysis methods often become computationally intractable or exhibit high estimator variance when applied to problems with hundreds of uncertain parameters or highly concentrated failure regions. In this work, we investigate the use of the recently proposed Deep Inverse Rosenblatt Transport (DIRT) framework for reliability analysis in solid mechanics. DIRT combines a TT decomposition with an inverse Rosenblatt transformation to construct a low-rank approximation of the posterior distribution, enabling efficient sampling and probability estimation in high-dimensional spaces. By representing the optimal importance density in the TT format, DIRT scales linearly in the input dimension while maintaining a compact, reusable surrogate of the target distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the DIRT framework on three analytical reliability problems and one numerical example with dimensionality ranging from 2 to 250. Compared to established methods such as Bayesian updating with Subset Simulation (BUS-SuS), DIRT seems to lower the estimator variance while accurately capturing rare event probabilities for the benchmark problems of this study.</description>

      <title>A CFL condition for the finite cell method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Immersed boundary finite element methods allow the user to bypass the potentially troublesome task of boundary-conforming mesh generation. When combined with explicit time integration, poorly cut elements with little support in the physical domain lead to a severely reduced critical time step size, posing a major challenge for immersed wave propagation simulations. The finite cell method stabilizes cut elements by defining the weak form of the problem also in the fictitious domain, but scaled by a small value $\alpha$. This paper investigates the effect of the finite cell method on the critical time step size for explicit time integration. Starting with an analytical one-degree-of-freedom model, we systematically study the influence of $\alpha$-stabilization on the maximum eigenvalue, and thus on the critical time step size, for corner and sliver cuts. The analysis is complemented by a numerical study of an example with one element and increasing polynomial degree, confirming that the critical time step size does not decrease below a certain limit, even as the cut fraction tends to zero. This lower bound is controlled by the choice of $\alpha$. In higher dimensions, sliver cuts are found to be more detrimental than corner cuts, thus determining the minimum critical time step size. Increasing the polynomial degree has only little effect on this degradation. Based on these observations, we derive an estimate of the minimum critical time step size as a function of $\alpha$, which we use to propose a modified CFL condition for the finite cell method. The validity of this condition is demonstrated on a two-dimensional perforated plate example.</description>
