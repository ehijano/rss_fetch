      <title>TriggerCalib: a turnkey package for estimating LHCb trigger efficiencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven estimations of trigger efficiencies are essential to LHCb physics analyses. A software package, TriggerCalib, has been developed to provide a centralised framework of trigger efficiency calculations. In this paper, a data-driven method of estimating trigger efficiencies is presented, within the context of the TriggerCalib package, and its functionalities validated on candidate $B^+\to J/\psi\left(\mu^+\mu^-\right) K^+$ decays in LHCb simulated data. A detailed overview of the trigger efficiency calculations is given, discussing different background mitigation methods and the computation of statistical and systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is Sensitive to Dark Photons and the Axion-Photon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nuclear magnetic resonance based searches for dark matter (DM) have intrinsic and powerful sensitivity to dark photons and the axion-photon coupling. The reason is conceptually straightforward. An instrument such as CASPEr-Gradient begins with a large sample of nuclear spins polarised in a background magnetic field. In the presence of axion DM coupled to nucleons, the spin ensemble feels an effective magnetic field $\mathbf{B} \propto \nabla a$ that tilts the spins, generating a potentially observable precession. If the magnetic field is real rather than effective, the system responds identically. A real field can be generated by a kinetically mixed dark photon within the shielded region the sample is placed or an axion coupled to photons through its interaction with the background magnetic field. We show that all three signals are detectable and distinguishable. If CASPEr-Gradient were to reach the QCD axion prediction of the axion-nucleon coupling, it would simultaneously be sensitive to kinetic mixings of $\epsilon \simeq 3 \times 10^{-16}$ and axion-photon couplings of $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \simeq 2 \times 10^{-16}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m \simeq 1\,\mu{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>Mitigating cosmic ray-like correlated events with a modular quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors based on superconducting qubits are being scaled to larger qubit numbers, enabling the implementation of small-scale quantum error correction codes. However, catastrophic chip-scale correlated errors have been observed in these processors, attributed to e.g. cosmic ray impacts, which challenge conventional error-correction codes such as the surface code. These events are characterized by a temporary but pronounced suppression of the qubit energy relaxation times. Here, we explore the potential for modular quantum computing architectures to mitigate such correlated energy decay events. We measure cosmic ray-like events in a quantum processor comprising a motherboard and two flip-chip bonded daughterboard modules, each module containing two superconducting qubits. We monitor the appearance of correlated qubit decay events within a single module and across the physically separated modules. We find that while decay events within one module are strongly correlated (over $85\%$), events in separate modules only display $\sim 2\%$ correlations. We also report coincident decay events in the motherboard and in either of the two daughterboard modules, providing further insight into the nature of these decay events. These results suggest that modular architectures, combined with bespoke error correction codes, offer a promising approach for protecting future quantum processors from chip-scale correlated errors.</description>

      <title>An automated algorithmic method to mitigate long-term variations in the efficiency of the GRAPES-3 muon telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GRAPES-3 large area muon telescope with its sixteen independent modules records the high energy (&gt;1 GeV) muons continuously over 2.3 sr of the sky. However, the recorded muon rates are contaminated by instrumental effects and instabilities spanning both short- and long-timescales, such as variations in the efficiency of the detector. We present an automated, algorithmic method, which employs Bayesian blocks to discretize the data stream into periods and exploits the correlations among the sixteen independent modules of the muon telescope to separate the impact of these instrumental problems from those originating in physical effects of interest, allowing the Savitzky-Golay filter to be employed to mitigate the former. Compared to legacy methods, this method is less dependent on subjective input from experimental operators and provides a data stream free of all known instrumental effects over calendar years. The muon rate obtained with the new method shows a fairly better correlation with neutron monitor data, than that obtained with the legacy method.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the inert Triplet desert region with a pNGB Dark Matter and its Gravitational Wave signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the scalar sector of the conventional hyperchargeless inert triplet model (ITM) to include a second dark matter (DM) candidate, which appears to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). The usual ITM with an extended scalar sector offers a DM candidate along with novel signatures at different experiments, e.g., colliders, gravitational wave detectors, etc. Nevertheless, hitherto unseen experimental detections have placed stringent constraints on the ITM parameter space. Moreover, triplet masses lighter than $1.9$ TeV, consistent with the existing or upcoming collider sensitivity reach, are already excluded from the DM observable, as they yield an underabundant relic density due to a strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge annihilation. Inclusion of a pNGB DM, via a complex $SU(2)_L$ scalar singlet and through the soft-breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry, helps to revive the sub-TeV regime of the triplet DM. This resurgence relies on a proficient conversion between the two DM species. Using this inter-conversion, with the triplet DM as the lighter one between the two, we show that it is possible to push the triplet DM contribution to $50\% - 60\%$ of the total relic density. This offers a significant improvement over the traditional ITM with a single DM candidate, where the same can at most reach $10\% - 20\%$. Besides, the concerned bipartite DM framework also offers the possibility of a first-order phase transition along various constituent field directions. Among these, the one along the real $SU(2)_L$ singlet direction can be a strong one which subsequently yields detectable gravitational wave signals at the upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc., alongside distinctive and complementary signatures at the various DM and collider quests.</description>

      <title>Resistive Plate Chamber Detector Construction and Certification: State-of-the-Art Facilities at the Max Planck Institute for Physics, in Partnership with Industrial Partners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) featuring 1 mm gas volumes combined with high-pressure phenolic laminate (HPL) electrodes provide excellent timing resolution down to a few hundred picoseconds, along with spatial resolution on the order of a few millimeters. Thanks to their relatively low production cost and robust performance in high-background environments, RPCs have become essential components for instrumenting large detection areas in high-energy physics experiments. The growing demand for these advanced RPC detectors, particularly for the High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), necessitates the establishment of new production facilities capable of delivering high-quality detectors at an industrial scale. To address this requirement, a dedicated RPC assembly and certification facility has been developed at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, leveraging strategic collaborations with industrial partners MIRION and PTS. This partnership facilitated the transfer of advanced, research-level assembly methodologies into robust, scalable industrial processes. Through a structured, phased prototyping and certification approach, initial tests on small-scale ($40 \times 50 \, cm^2$) prototypes validated the scalability and applicability of optimized production procedures to large-scale ($1.0 \times 2.0 \, m^2$) RPC detectors. Currently, the project has entered its final certification phase, involving extensive performance and longevity testing, including a year-long irradiation campaign at CERN's Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++). This article details the development and successful industrial implementation of novel assembly techniques, highlighting the enhanced capabilities and reliability of RPC detectors prepared through this industrial-academic collaboration, ensuring readiness for upcoming challenges in high-energy physics detector instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Fast Low Energy Reconstruction using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IceCube is a Cherenkov detector instrumenting over a cubic kilometer of glacial ice deep under the surface of the South Pole. The DeepCore sub-detector lowers the detection energy threshold to a few GeV, enabling the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. The reconstruction of neutrino interactions inside the detector is essential in studying neutrino oscillations. It is particularly challenging to reconstruct sub-100 GeV events with the IceCube detectors due to the relatively sparse detection units and detection medium. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly used in physics experiments for both classification and regression purposes. This paper discusses the CNNs developed and employed for the latest IceCube-DeepCore oscillation measurements. These CNNs estimate various properties of the detected neutrinos, such as their energy, direction of arrival, interaction vertex position, flavor-related signature, and are also used for background classification.</description>

      <title>Search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons A and H in the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$Z channel in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct search for new heavy neutral Higgs bosons A and H in the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$Z channel is presented, targeting the process pp $\to$ A $\to$ ZH with H $\to$ $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$. For the first time, the channel with decays of the Z boson to muons or electrons in association with all-hadronic decays of the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ system is targeted. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected at the CERN LHC with the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. No signal is observed. Upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fractions are derived for narrow resonances A and H with masses up to 2100 and 2000 GeV, respectively, assuming A boson production through gluon fusion. The results are also interpreted within two-Higgs-doublet models, where A and H are CP-odd and CP-even states, respectively, complementing and substantially extending the reach of previous searches.</description>

      <title>Measurement of off-shell Higgs boson production in the $H^*\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 4\ell$ decay channel using a neural simulation-based inference technique in 13 TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A measurement of off-shell Higgs boson production in the $H^*\to ZZ\to 4\ell$ decay channel is presented. The measurement uses 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider and supersedes the previous result in this decay channel using the same dataset. The data analysis is performed using a neural simulation-based inference method, which builds per-event likelihood ratios using neural networks. The observed (expected) off-shell Higgs boson production signal strength in the $ZZ\to 4\ell$ decay channel at 68% CL is $0.87^{+0.75}_{-0.54}$ ($1.00^{+1.04}_{-0.95}$). The evidence for off-shell Higgs boson production using the $ZZ\to 4\ell$ decay channel has an observed (expected) significance of $2.5\sigma$ ($1.3\sigma$). The expected result represents a significant improvement relative to that of the previous analysis of the same dataset, which obtained an expected significance of $0.5\sigma$. When combined with the most recent ATLAS measurement in the $ZZ\to 2\ell 2\nu$ decay channel, the evidence for off-shell Higgs boson production has an observed (expected) significance of $3.7\sigma$ ($2.4\sigma$). The off-shell measurements are combined with the measurement of on-shell Higgs boson production to obtain constraints on the Higgs boson total width. The observed (expected) value of the Higgs boson width at 68% CL is $4.3^{+2.7}_{-1.9}$ ($4.1^{+3.5}_{-3.4}$) MeV.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical cavity design that bypasses mode mixings in axion haloscope experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design is easily realizable in practical experiments and makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.</description>

      <title>Fully-heavy hadronic molecules $B_c^{(*)+} B_c^{(*)-}$ bound by fully-heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A lot of exotic hadrons were reported in the past twenty years, which bring us the renaissance of the hadron spectroscopy. Most of them can be understood as hadronic molecules, whose interactions are mainly due to the exchange of light mesons, and specifically, light vector mesons through the coupled-channel unitary approach within the local hidden-gauge formalism. It is still controversial whether the interaction arising from the exchange of heavy mesons is capable of forming hadronic molecules. We apply the coupled-channel unitary approach to study the fully-heavy $b \bar b c \bar c$ system, where the exchanged mesons can only be the fully-heavy vector mesons $J/\psi$, $B_c^*$, and $\Upsilon$. Especially, the $J/\psi$ meson is much lighter than the $B_c^{(*)}$ mesons, so the present study can be taken as a general investigation on the question whether a lower-mass fully-heavy meson is able to bind two higher-mass fully-heavy hadrons. Our results suggest the existence of the fully-heavy hadronic molecules $|B_c^{+} B_c^{-}; J^{PC}=0^{++} \rangle$, $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} - c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{+-} \rangle$, and $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{*-}; J^{PC}=2^{++} \rangle$ as well as the possible existence of $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} + c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{++} \rangle$. These states are potentially to be observed in the $\mu^+ \mu^- J/\psi$ and $\mu^+ \mu^- \Upsilon$ channels in future ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Resolving the W-Boson Mass in the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the parameter space of the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model (LS-2HDM) is investigated to align the W-boson mass reported by the CDF and CMS experiment with recent theoretical and experimental findings. The Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model, a distinguished category within Two Higgs Doublet Models, contains two CP-even, one CP-odd, and two charged scalar bosons, which play crucial role in estimating W boson mass. First, constraints from diverse experimental data, including ATLAS 13 TeV analyses, rare B-meson decays, and Lepton Flavor Universality in tau-lepton and Z-boson decays, are determined and imposed on the parameter space of the model. These constraints are subsequently applied to potential solutions generated through random scans using SARAH 4.13.0 and analyzed using SPheno 4.0.3. The analysis indicates the possibility of realizing the CDF and CMS reported W-boson mass up to $1\sigma$ . The mass of the $W$ boson was determined by the CMS collaboration as $80.3602 \pm 0.0099$ GeV in 2024 and was in very good agreement with the Standard Model. In the current analysis, the $W$ mass value reported by the CDF collaboration in 2022 ($80.4335 \pm 0.0094$ GeV) has been compared with the latest CMS measurement in the context of the LS-2HDM model. Analyses done with the parametric freedom of LS-2HDM show that the model can equally well explain both the measured value of CDF and the measurement result of CMS. It is emphasized by our findings that LS-2HDM contains areas favorable to both CDF and CMS data, which makes both existing experimental results explainable under the framework of the same model.</description>

      <title>Lab and Beam Tests of a SiPM-readout ASIC with a Large Dynamic Range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A front-end readout system with a large dynamic range is required for the high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) at future Higgs factories. A new commercially available ASIC, MPT2321, which offers a significantly large dynamic range for the readout of the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), has been tested in the laboratory and at a test beam facility. The fundamental performance metrics have been characterised, including response linearity, inter-calibration factor and noise performance. To quantitatively assess the dynamic range of the chip and evaluate its feasibility for SiPM readout in high-granularity crystal ECAL, a beamtest was conducted using scintillating crystals exposed to electron beams. Beamtest results showed that the chip exhibits a promising performance in terms of a good signal-to-noise ratio and a relatively large dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Neutrino Signals from Dark Stars Seeding Super-Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark stars (DSs) -- first stars powered by dark-matter (DM) heating rather than fusion -- could form in the early Universe. They can grow to $\gtrsim 10^5 M_{\odot}$ masses and collapse into seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We demonstrate that diffuse neutrino flux generated by DSs can be observable in existing experiments and have energies reaching hundreds of MeV, providing novel window for probing SMBH progenitors. We establish first constraints on DSs and DM annihilations powering them using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE, JUNO will be able to explore DS properties with enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Predicting the cryogenic performance of superconducting detectors by their visual properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The testing and quality assurance of cryogenic superconducting detectors is a time- and labor-intensive process. As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly. Here, we propose a process for flagging under-performing detector wafers before they are ever tested cryogenically. Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%. Lastly, results from running the pipeline on prototype microwave kinetic inductance detectors from the planned SPT-3G+ experiment are presented.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter via Charged Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark matter direct-detection strategy using charged particle decays at accelerator-based experiments. If ultralight $(m_\phi \ll \text{eV})$ dark matter has a misalignment abundance, its local field oscillates in time at a frequency set by its mass. If it also couples to flavor-changing neutral currents, rare exotic decays such as $\mu \to e \phi'$ and $\tau\to e(\mu)\phi'$ inherit this modulation. Focusing on such charged lepton flavor-violating decays, we show that sufficient event samples can enable detection of ultralight dark matter candidates at Mu3e, Belle-II, and FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Observation of nuclear modification of energy-energy correlators inside jets in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy-energy correlators are constructed by averaging the number of charged particle pairs within jets, weighted by the product of their transverse momenta, as a function of the angular separation of the particles within a pair. They are sensitive to a multitude of perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics phenomena in high-energy particle collisions. Using lead-lead data recorded with the CMS detector, energy-energy correlators inside high transverse momentum jets are measured in heavy ion collisions for the first time. The data are obtained at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.70 nb$^{-1}$. A similar analysis is done for proton-proton collisions at the same center-of-mass energy to establish a reference. The ratio of lead-lead to proton-proton energy-energy correlators reveals significant jet substructure modifications in the quark-gluon plasma. The results are compared to different models that incorporate either color coherence or medium response effects, where the two effects predict similar substructure modifications.</description>

      <title>Prototype acoustic positioning system for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and initial performance characterization of the prototype acoustic positioning system intended for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment. It comprises novel piezo-acoustic receivers with dedicated filtering- and amplification electronics installed in P-ONE instruments and is complemented by a commercial system comprised of cabled and autonomous acoustic pingers for sub-sea installation manufactured by Sonardyne Ltd. We performed an in-depth characterization of the acoustic receiver electronics and their acoustic sensitivity when integrated into P-ONE pressure housings. These show absolute sensitivities of up to $-125\,$dB re V$^2/\mu$Pa$^2$ in a frequency range of $10-40\,$kHz. We furthermore conducted a positioning measurement campaign in the ocean by deploying three autonomous acoustic pingers on the seafloor, as well as a cabled acoustic interrogator and a P-ONE prototype module deployed from a ship. Using a simple peak-finding detection algorithm, we observe high accuracy in the tracking of relative ranging times at approximately $230-280\,\mu$s at distances of up to $1600\,$m, which is sufficient for positioning detectors in a cubic-kilometer detector and which can be further improved with more involved detection algorithms. The tracking accuracy is further confirmed by independent ranging of the Sonardyne system and closely follows the ship's drift in the wind measured by GPS. The absolute positioning shows the same tracking accuracy with its absolute precision only limited by the large uncertainties of the deployed pinger positions on the seafloor.</description>
