      <title>Stable rationality of hypersurfaces of mock toric variety II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a development in approaching rationality problems through motivic methods (cf. [Kontsevich--Tschinkel'19], [Nicaise--Shinder'19], [Nicaise--Ottem'21]). This method requires the explicit construction of degeneration families of curves with favorable properties. While the specific construction is generally difficult, [Nicaise--Ottem'22] combines combinatorial methods to construct degeneration families of hypersurfaces in toric varieties and mentions the stable rationality of a very general hypersurface in projective spaces. In this paper, we substitute mock toric varieties for toric varieties and we prove the following theorem from the motivic method: If a very general hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^{2n-5}_\mathbb{C}$ is not stably rational, then a very general hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\mathrm{Gr}_\mathbb{C}(2, n)$ is not stably rational.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of coherent systems in $P^2$ using the Segre invariant. We obtain necessary conditions for the existence of $\alpha$-semistable coherent systems $(E,V)$ of type $(2, c_1, c_2, k)$, with $k \geq 2$. Afterwards, we give numerical conditions to the nonemptiness of the moduli space and compute the critical values depending of the Chern classes. Finally, we give some topological properties of the flips.</description>

      <title>Universal piecewise polynomiality for counting curves in toric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by piecewise polynomiality results of double Hurwitz numbers, Ardila and Brugall\'e introduced an enumerative problem which they call double Gromov--Witten invariants of Hirzebruch surfaces. These invariants serve as a two-dimensional analogue and satisfy a similar piecewise polynomial structure. More precisely, they introduced the enumeration of curves in Hirzebruch surfaces satisfying point conditions and tangency conditions on the two parallel toric boundaries. These conditions are stored in four partitions and the resulting invariants are piecewise polynomial in their entries. Moreover, they found that these expressions also behave polynomially with respect to the parameter determining the underlying Hirzebruch surfaces. Based on work of Ardila and Block, they proposed that such a polynomiality could also hold while changing between more general toric surfaces corresponding to $h$-transverse polygons. In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Moreover, we express the resulting invariants for $h$-transverse polygons as matrix elements in the two-dimensional bosonic Fock space.</description>

      <title>Smoothing low-dimensional algebraic cycles [after Koll\'ar and Voisin]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective complex algebraic variety. An old question of Borel and Haefliger asks whether any (possibly singular) algebraic subvariety of $X$ is homologically equivalent to a linear combination with integral coefficients of smooth algebraic subvarieties of $X$. In general, this question is too optimistic, and counterexamples have been known for a long time. The aim of this survey is to explain how J\'anos Koll\'ar and Claire Voisin have provided a positive answer to Borel and Haefliger's question, for subvarieties of dimension less than half the dimension of $X$.</description>

      <title>Projectivity of good moduli spaces of vector bundles on stacky curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moduli of vector bundles on stacky curves behave similarly to moduli of vector bundles on curves, except there are additional numerical invariants giving many different notions of stability. We apply the existence criterion for good moduli spaces of stacks to show that the moduli stack of semistable vector bundles on a stacky curve has a proper good moduli space. We moduli-theoretically prove that a natural determinantal line bundle on this moduli space is ample, thus proving this moduli space is projective. Our methods give effective bounds for when a power of this line bundle is basepoint-free. As a special case, we obtain new and effective constructions of moduli spaces of parabolic bundles.</description>

Abstract: We study pencils of plane cubics with only one base point and general member smooth, giving a complete classification. Under the additional hypothesis that all members are irreducible, we prove that there exists a unique non-isotrivial pencil with these properties up to projective transformation. We compare our construction with the classical approaches given by Gattazzo, Beauville and Miranda-Persson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the curvature properties of higher direct images $ R^qf_*\Omega_{X/S}^p(E)$, where $f: X\rightarrow S$ is a family of compact K\"ahler manifolds equipped with a hermitian vector bundle $E \rightarrow X$. We derive a general curvature formula and explore several special cases, including those where $p + q = n$, $q = 0$, and $p = n$, with $E$ being a line bundle. Furthermore, the paper examines the curvature in the context of fiberwise hermitian flat cases, families of Hermite-Einstein vector bundles, and applications to moduli spaces and Weil-Petersson metrics, providing some insight into their geometric and analytical properties.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued.</description>

      <title>A new construction of $c=1$ Virasoro blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonabelianization map for conformal blocks, which relates $c=1$ Virasoro blocks on a Riemann surface $C$ to Heisenberg blocks on a branched double cover $\widetilde{C}$ of $C$. The nonabelianization map uses the datum of a spectral network on $C$. It gives new formulas for Virasoro blocks as regularized Fredholm determinants of integral operators, with kernel given by an appropriate free-fermion two-point function on $\widetilde{C}$. The nonabelianization map also intertwines with the action of Verlinde loop operators, and can be used to construct eigenblocks. This leads to new Kyiv-type formulas and Fredholm determinant formulas for $\tau$-functions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a Lefschetz trace formula for B\"ockle-Pink crystals on tame Deligne-Mumford stacks of finite type over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and apply it to the crystal associated to the universal Drinfeld module. Combined with the Eichler-Shimura theory developed by B\"ockle, this leads to a trace formula for Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms. As a corollary, we deduce a Ramanujan bound on the traces of Hecke operators.</description>

We deduce closed-form expressions for traces of Hecke operators corresponding to primes of degree 1 and provide algorithms for primes of higher degree. We improve the Ramanujan bound and deduce the decomposition of cusp forms of level $\Gamma_0(T)$ into oldforms and newforms, as conjectured by Bandini-Valentino, under the hypothesis that each Hecke eigenvalue has multiplicity less than $p$.</description>

      <title>Linear causal disentanglement via higher-order cumulants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear causal disentanglement is a recent method in causal representation learning to describe a collection of observed variables via latent variables with causal dependencies between them. It can be viewed as a generalization of both independent component analysis and linear structural equation models. We study the identifiability of linear causal disentanglement, assuming access to data under multiple contexts, each given by an intervention on a latent variable. We show that one perfect intervention on each latent variable is sufficient and in the worst case necessary to recover parameters under perfect interventions, generalizing previous work to allow more latent than observed variables. We give a constructive proof that computes parameters via a coupled tensor decomposition. For soft interventions, we find the equivalence class of latent graphs and parameters that are consistent with observed data, via the study of a system of polynomial equations. Our results hold assuming the existence of non-zero higher-order cumulants, which implies non-Gaussianity of variables.</description>

      <title>Determination Problems for Orbit Closures and Matrix Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational problems concerning the orbit of a point under the action of a matrix group occur in numerous subfields of computer science, including complexity theory, program analysis, quantum computation, and automata theory. In many cases the focus extends beyond orbits proper to orbit closures under a suitable topology. Typically one starts from a group and several points and asks questions about the orbit closure of the points under the action of the group, e.g., whether two given orbit closures intersect.
  In this paper we consider a collection of what we call determination problems concerning groups and orbit closures. These problems begin with a given variety and seek to understand whether and how it arises either as an algebraic group or as an orbit closure. The how question asks whether the underlying group is $s$-generated, meaning it is topologically generated by $s$ matrices for a given number $s$. Among other applications, problems of this type have recently been studied in the context of synthesising loops subject to certain specified invariants on program variables.
  Our main result is a polynomial-space procedure that inputs a variety $V$ and a number $s$ and determines whether $V$ arises as an orbit closure of a point under an $s$-generated commutative matrix group. The main tools in our approach are rooted in structural properties of commutative algebraic matrix groups and lattice theory. We leave open the question of determining whether a variety is an orbit closure of a point under an algebraic matrix group (without the requirement of commutativity). In this regard, we note that a recent paper by Nosan et al. [NPSHW2021] gives an elementary procedure to compute the orbit closure of a point under finitely many matrices.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an explicit description of the Zariski-open subset of the moduli space of rank 2 parabolic logarithmic connections in the case $g\geq 2$. Our approach is to analyze the underlying parabolic bundles and the apparent singularities of the parabolic connections. We prove that a Zariski-open subset of the product of a projective space and the moduli space of parabolic bundles gives a Darboux coordinate for the moduli space of parabolic connections.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the quotient of a klt type singularity by a reductive group is of klt type. In particular, given a klt variety $X$ endowed with the action of a reductive group $G$ and admitting a quasi-projective good quotient $X\rightarrow X/\!/G$, we can find a boundary $B$ on $X/\!/G$ so that the pair $(X/\!/G,B)$ is klt. This applies for example to GIT-quotients of klt varieties. Our main result has consequences for complex spaces obtained as quotients of Hamiltonian K\"ahler $G$-manifolds, for collapsings of homogeneous vector bundles as introduced by Kempf, and for good moduli spaces of smooth Artin stacks. In particular, it implies that the good moduli space parametrizing $n$-dimensional K-polystable Fano manifolds of volume $v$ has klt type singularities. As a corresponding result regarding global geometry, we show that quotients of Mori Dream Spaces with klt Cox rings are Mori Dream Spaces with klt Cox ring. This in turn applies to show that projective GIT-quotients of varieties of Fano type are of Fano type; in particular, projective moduli spaces of semistable quiver representations are of Fano type.</description>

      <title>Counting divisorial contractions with centre a $cA_n$-singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First, we simplify the existing classification due to Kawakita and Yamamoto of 3-dimensional divisorial contractions with centre a $cA_n$-singularity, also called compound $A_n$ singularity. Next, we describe the global algebraic divisorial contractions corresponding to a given local analytic equivalence class of divisorial contractions with centre a point. Finally, we consider divisorial contractions of discrepancy at least 2 to a fixed variety with centre a $cA_n$-singularity. We show that if there exists one such divisorial contraction, then there exist uncountably many such divisorial contractions.</description>

      <title>Integral models of moduli spaces of shtukas with deep Bruhat-Tits level structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct integral models for moduli spaces of shtukas with deep Bruhat-Tits level structures. We embed the moduli space of global shtukas for a deep Bruhat-Tits group scheme into the limit of the moduli spaces of shtukas for all associated parahoric group schemes. Its schematic image defines an integral model of the moduli space of shtukas with deep Bruhat-Tits level with favourable properties: They admit proper, surjective and generically \'etale level maps as well as a natural Newton stratification. In the Drinfeld case, this general construction of integral models recovers the moduli space of Drinfeld shtukas with Drinfeld level structures.</description>

Abstract: We propose a comparison between the Berkovich skeleton of Berkovich analytification of $(\overline{\textsf{M}}_{0,n},{\overline{\textsf{M}}_{0,n} \setminus \textsf{M}_{0,n}})$ and faithful tropicalization of $\textsf{M}_{0,n}$ over a complete discrete valued field. In particular, we proved the two combinatorial structures are the same in terms of valuation in $\overline{\textsf{M}}^{\textsf{an}}_{0,n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a non-projective compact K\"ahler $3$-fold with nef anti-canonical bundle is, up to a finite \'etale cover, one of the following: a manifold with vanishing first Chern class; the product of a K3 surface and the projective line; or a projective space bundle over a $2$-dimensional torus. This result extends Cao-H\"oring's structure theorem for projective manifolds to compact K\"ahler manifolds in dimension $3$. For the proof, we investigate the Minimal Model Program for compact K\"ahler $3$-folds with nef anti-canonical bundles by using the positivity of direct image sheaves, $\mathbb{Q}$-conic bundles, and orbifold vector bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an explicit basis of the miniversal deformation of a monomial curve defined by a free semigroup -- these curves make up a notable family of complete intersection monomial curves. First, we dispense a general decomposition result of a basis of the miniversal deformation of any complete intersection monomial curve. As a consequence, we explicitly calculate this basis in the particular case of a monomial curve defined from a free semigroup. This explicit computation yields some estimates for the dimension of the moduli space of these family of curves.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the moduli space of rank three parabolic logarithmic connections on the projective line with three poles for any local exponents. In particular, we show that the family of moduli spaces of rank three parabolic $\phi$-connections on the projective line with three poles is isomorphic to the family of $A^{(1)*}_2$-surfaces in Sakai's classification of Painlev\'e equations. Through this description, we investigate the relation between the apparent singularities and underlying parabolic bundles.</description>

Abstract: We determine the Brauer group of the Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$, the moduli space of elliptic curves with a marked $2$-torsion subgroup over bases of arithmetic interest. Antieau and Meier determine the Brauer group for $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$, the moduli stack of elliptic curves by exploiting the fact it is covered by the Legendre family and using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Over an algebraically closed field, Shin uses the coarse space map to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$. We combine techniques from both papers to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$.</description>

Abstract: The real Grassmannian is both a projective variety (via Pl\"ucker coordinates) and an affine variety (via orthogonal projections). We connect these two representations, and we develop the commutative algebra of the latter variety.

Abstract: We construct stability conditions on crepant resolutions of certain quotients of product varieties, giving as a special case the first examples of stability conditions on strict Calabi-Yau varieties of arbitrary dimension. Along the way, we prove the crepant resolutions are derived equivalent to the corresponding quotient stacks, verifying an instance of a conjecture of Bondal and Orlov.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Weak Lefschetz Properties for modules whose minimal free resolutions are given by generalized Kosuzl complexes in dimension three through a careful study of their Betti numbers and the symmetry and unimodality of their Hilbert functions. We also study the non-Lefschetz locus for finite length modules in arbitrary dimension, and are able to generalize several previous results on the non-Lefschetz locus in this setting. Along the way, we find several connections with a Gorenstein analogue for finite length modules and Artin level modules that are both interesting and useful throughout this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.01981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry for higher genus curves is usually formulated and studied in terms of Landau-Ginzburg models; however the critical locus of the superpotential is arguably of greater intrinsic relevance to mirror symmetry than the whole Landau-Ginzburg model. Accordingly, we propose a new approach to the A-model of the mirror, viewed as a trivalent configuration of rational curves together with some extra data at the nodal points. In this context, we introduce a version of Lagrangian Floer theory and the Fukaya category for trivalent graphs, and show that homological mirror symmetry holds, namely, that the Fukaya category of a trivalent configuration of rational curves is equivalent to the derived category of a non-Archimedean generalized Tate curve. To illustrate the concrete nature of this equivalence, we show how explicit formulas for theta functions and for the canonical map of the curve arise naturally under mirror symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we provide a "combinatorial" description of the category of tilting perverse sheaves on the affine flag variety of a reductive algebraic group, and its free-monodromic variant, with coefficients in a field of positive characteristic. This provides a replacement for the familiar "Soergel theory" for characteristic-0 coefficients, and the second step in our project towards the construction of an equivalence of categories relating the two natural geometric realizations of the associated affine Hecke algebra in the case of positive-characteristic coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the work of Lai, Longhi, Suzuki, the first two authors and study the change of $\mu$-invariants, with respect to a finite Galois p-extension $K'/K$, of an ordinary abelian variety $A$ over a $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-extension of global fields $L/K$ that ramifies at a finite number of places at which $A$ has ordinary reductions. In characteristic $p&gt;0$, we obtain an explicit bound for the size $\delta_v$ of the local Galois cohomology of the Mordell-Weil group of $A$ with respect to a $p$-extension ramified at a supersingular place $v$. Next, in all characteristics, we describe the asymptotic growth of $\delta_v$ along a multiple $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $L/K$ and provide a lower bound for the change of $\mu$-invariants of $A$ from the tower $L/K$ to the tower $LK'/K'$. Finally, we present numerical evidence supporting these results.</description>

Abstract: We consider finite graphs whose vertexes are supersingular elliptic curves, possibly with level structure, and edges are isogenies. They can be applied to the study of modular forms and to isogeny based cryptography. The main result of this paper is an upper bound on the modules of the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices, which in particular implies that these graphs are Ramanujan. We also study the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices, the number of connected components, the automorphisms of the graphs, and the connection between the graphs and modular forms.</description>

Abstract: We extend Deligne's original argument showing that locally coherent topoi have enough points, clarified using collage diagrams. We show that our refinement of Deligne's technique can be adapted to recover every existing result of this kind, including the most recent results about $\kappa$-coherent $\kappa$-topoi. Our presentation allows us to relax the cardinality assumptions typically imposed on the sites involved. We show that a larger class of locally finitely presentable toposes have enough points and that a closed subtopos of a topos with enough points has enough points.</description>

Abstract: We prove a cohomological splitting result for Hamiltonian fibrations over enumeratively rationally connected symplectic manifolds As a key application, we prove that the cohomology of a smooth, projective family over a smooth (stably) rational projective variety splits additively over any field. The main ingredients in our arguments include the theory of Fukaya-Ono-Parker (FOP) perturbations developed by the first and third author, which allows one to define integer-valued Gromov-Witten type invariants, and variants of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith's global Kuranishi charts tailored to concrete geometric problems.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>
