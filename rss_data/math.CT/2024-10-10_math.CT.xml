      <title>2-Rig Extensions and the Splitting Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically, the splitting principle says how to pull back a vector bundle in such a way that it splits into line bundles and the pullback map induces an injection on $K$-theory. Here we categorify the splitting principle and generalize it to the context of 2-rigs. A 2-rig is a kind of categorified "ring without negatives", such as a category of vector bundles with $\oplus$ as addition and $\otimes$ as multiplication. Technically, we define a 2-rig to be a Cauchy complete $k$-linear symmetric monoidal category where $k$ has characteristic zero. We conjecture that for any suitably finite-dimensional object $r$ of a 2-rig $\mathsf{R}$, there is a 2-rig map $E \colon \mathsf{R} \to \mathsf{R'}$ such that $E(r)$ splits as a direct sum of finitely many "subline objects" and $E$ has various good properties: it is faithful, conservative, essentially injective, and the induced map of Grothendieck rings $K(E) \colon K(\mathsf{R}) \to K(\mathsf{R'})$ is injective. We prove this conjecture for the free 2-rig on one object, namely the category of Schur functors, whose Grothendieck ring is the free $\lambda$-ring on one generator, also known as the ring of symmetric functions. We use this task as an excuse to develop the representation theory of affine categories - that is, categories enriched in affine schemes - using the theory of 2-rigs.</description>

      <title>Towards the Nerves of Steel Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a local $\otimes$-triangulated category, and a fiber sequence $y\to 1 \to x$, one may ask if there is always a nonzero object $z$ such that either $z\otimes f$ or $z\otimes g$ is $\otimes$-nilpotent. The claim that this property holds for all local $\otimes$-triangulated categories is equivalent to Balmer's "nerves of steel conjecture" from arXiv:2001.00284. In the present paper, we will see how this property can fail if the category we start with is not rigid, discuss a large class of categories where the property holds, and ultimately prove that the nerves of steel conjecture is equivalent to a stronger form of this property.</description>

      <title>An Internal Logic of Virtual Double Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a type theory called fibrational virtual double type theory (FVDblTT) designed specifically for formal category theory, which is a succinct reformulation of New and Licata's Virtual Equipment Type Theory (VETT). FVDblTT formalizes reasoning on isomorphisms that are commonly employed in category theory. Virtual double categories are one of the most successful frameworks for developing formal category theory, and FVDblTT has them as a theoretical foundation. We validate its worth as an internal language of virtual double categories by providing a syntax-semantics duality between virtual double categories and specifications in FVDblTT as a biadjunction.</description>

      <title>Towards a Categorical Foundation of Deep Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented pace of machine learning research has lead to incredible advances, but also poses hard challenges. At present, the field lacks strong theoretical underpinnings, and many important achievements stem from ad hoc design choices which are hard to justify in principle and whose effectiveness often goes unexplained. Research debt is increasing and many papers are found not to be reproducible.
  This thesis is a survey that covers some recent work attempting to study machine learning categorically. Category theory is a branch of abstract mathematics that has found successful applications in many fields, both inside and outside mathematics. Acting as a lingua franca of mathematics and science, category theory might be able to give a unifying structure to the field of machine learning. This could solve some of the aforementioned problems.
  In this work, we mainly focus on the application of category theory to deep learning. Namely, we discuss the use of categorical optics to model gradient-based learning, the use of categorical algebras and integral transforms to link classical computer science to neural networks, the use of functors to link different layers of abstraction and preserve structure, and, finally, the use of string diagrams to provide detailed representations of neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Galois theory and \'etale exodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite \'etale covers of a connected scheme $X$ are parametrised by the \'etale fundamental group via the monodromy correspondence. This was generalised to an exodromy correspondence for constructible sheaves, first in the topological setting by MacPherson, Treumann, Lurie, and others, and recently also for \'etale and pro-\'etale sheaves by Barwick--Glasman--Haine and Wolf. The proof of the \'etale exodromy theorem is long and technical, using many new definitions and constructions in the $(\infty,2)$-category of $\infty$-topoi. This paper gives a quick proof of the \'etale exodromy theorem for constructible sheaves of sets (with respect to a fixed stratification), in the style of Grothendieck's Galois theory.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Exactness Structure for Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.01350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two adjoint functors can be seen as generalisations of the two functions within a Galois connection. If instead the adjoints are not generalised from functions, but from relations, then analogously the object of study becomes a more general notion of an adjunction. A suitable method to express such functor-level relations is to consider functors into categories of families. This structure is then used to show that the central exactness structure in self-dual group theory, consisting of a chain of adjunctions, holds also for the category of sets when seen in this general form. EDIT: Please see the note about the empty set on page 4!</description>

      <title>When does $\operatorname{Ind}_\kappa(C^I) \simeq \operatorname{Ind}_\kappa(C)^I$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate under which condition the $\kappa$-ind completion of a functor category $C^I$ is equivalent to the category of functors from $I$ to the $\kappa$-ind completion of $C$. A published theorem implies this is true for any Cauchy complete category $C$ and $\kappa$-small category $I$, but we show this is not the case in general. We prove two results that seem to cover all applications of this incorrect theorem we could find in the literature: The result holds if $C$ has $\kappa$-small colimits and $I$ is $\kappa$-small, or if $C$ is an arbitrary category and $I$ is well-founded and $\kappa$-small. In both cases, we show that the conditions are optimal in the sense that the result holds for all $C$ if and only if $I$ satisfies the given assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Lurie's definition of enriched $\infty$-categories to notions of left enriched, right enriched and bienriched $\infty$-categories, which generalize the concepts of closed left tensored, right tensored and bitensored $\infty$-categories and share many desirable features with them. We use bienriched $\infty$-categories to endow the $\infty$-category of enriched functors with enrichment that generalizes both the internal hom of the tensor product of enriched $\infty$-categories when the latter exists, and the free cocompletion under colimits and tensors. As an application we construct enriched Kan-extensions from operadic Kan-extensions, compute the monad for enriched functors, prove an end formula for morphism objects of enriched $\infty$-categories of enriched functors and a coend formula for the relative tensor product of enriched profunctors and construct transfer of enrichment from scalar extension of presentably bitensored $\infty$-categories. In particular, we develop an independent theory of enriched $\infty$-categories for Lurie's model of enriched $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>A functorial approach to $n$-abelian categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a functorial approach to the study of $n$-abelian categories by reformulating their axioms in terms of their categories of finitely presented functors. Such an approach allows the use of classical homological algebra and representation theory techniques to understand higher homological algebra. As an application, we present two possible generalizations of the axioms "every monomorphism is a kernel" and "every epimorphism is a cokernel" of an abelian category to $n$-abelian categories. We also specialize our results to modules over rings, thereby describing when the category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring is $n$-abelian. Moreover, we establish a correspondence for $n$-abelian categories with additive generators, which extends the higher Auslander correspondence.</description>

      <title>Quasitoposes as elementary quotient completions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.15299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elementary quotient completion of an elementary doctrine in the sense of Lawvere was introduced in previous work by the first and third authors. It generalises the exact completion of a category with finite products and weak equalisers. In this paper we characterise when an elementary quotient completion is a quasi-topos. We obtain as a corollary a complete characterisation of when an elementary quotient completions is an elementary topos. As a byproduct we determine also when the elementary quotient completion of a tripos is equivalent to the doctrine obtained via the tripos-to-topos construction. Our results are reminiscent of other works regarding exact completions and put those under a common scheme: in particular, Carboni and Vitale's characterisation of exact completions in terms of their projective objects, Carboni and Rosolini's characterisation of locally cartesian closed exact completions, also in the revision by Emmenegger, and Menni's characterisation of the exact completions which are elementary toposes.</description>

Abstract: We prove a decomposition of the Hochschild homology groups of the equivariant dg category $\mathscr{C}^G$ associated to a small dg category $\mathscr{C}$ with direct sums on which a finite group $G$ acts. When the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$ this decomposition is related to a categorical action of $\text{Rep}(G)$ on $\mathscr{C}^G$ and the resulting action of the representation ring $R_\mathbb{C}(G)$ on $HH_\bullet(\mathscr{C}^G)$.</description>

      <title>Entropy, cocycles, and their diagrammatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of the paper explains how to encode a one-cocycle and a two-cocycle on a group $G$ with values in its representation by networks of planar trivalent graphs with edges labelled by elements of $G$, elements of the representation floating in the regions, and suitable rules for manipulation of these diagrams. When the group is a semidirect product, there is a similar presentation via overlapping networks for the two subgroups involved.
  M. Kontsevich and J.-L. Cathelineau have shown how to interpret the entropy of a finite random variable and infinitesimal dilogarithms, including their four-term functional relations, via 2-cocycles on the group of affine symmetries of a line.
  We convert their construction into a diagrammatical calculus evaluating planar networks that describe morphisms in suitable monoidal categories. In particular, the four-term relations become equalities of networks analogous to associativity equations. The resulting monoidal categories complement existing categorical and operadic approaches to entropy.</description>
