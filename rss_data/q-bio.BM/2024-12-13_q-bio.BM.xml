      <title>Multi-modal Representation Learning Enables Accurate Protein Function Prediction in Low-Data Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose HOPER (HOlistic ProtEin Representation), a novel multimodal learning framework designed to enhance protein function prediction (PFP) in low-data settings. The challenge of predicting protein functions is compounded by the limited availability of labeled data. Traditional machine learning models already struggle in such cases, and while deep learning models excel with abundant data, they also face difficulties when data is scarce. HOPER addresses this issue by integrating three distinct modalities - protein sequences, biomedical text, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks - to create a comprehensive protein representation. The model utilizes autoencoders to generate holistic embeddings, which are then employed for PFP tasks using transfer learning. HOPER outperforms existing methods on a benchmark dataset across all Gene Ontology categories, i.e., molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Additionally, we demonstrate its practical utility by identifying new immune-escape proteins in lung adenocarcinoma, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multimodal representation learning for overcoming data limitations in biological research, potentially enabling more accurate and scalable protein function prediction.

      <title>Sampling-based Continuous Optimization with Coupled Variables for RNA Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of RNA design given a target structure aims to find a sequence that can fold into that structure. It is a computationally hard problem where some version(s) have been proven to be NP-hard. As a result, heuristic methods such as local search have been popular for this task, but by only exploring a fixed number of candidates. They can not keep up with the exponential growth of the design space, and often perform poorly on longer and harder-to-design structures. We instead formulate these discrete problems as continuous optimization, which starts with a distribution over all possible candidate sequences, and uses gradient descent to improve the expectation of an objective function. We define novel distributions based on coupled variables to rule out invalid sequences given the target structure and to model the correlation between nucleotides. To make it universally applicable to any objective function, we use sampling to approximate the expected objective function, to estimate the gradient, and to select the final candidate. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our work consistently outperforms them in key metrics such as Boltzmann probability, ensemble defect, and energy gap, especially on long and hard-to-design puzzles in the Eterna100 benchmark. Our code is available at: http://github.com/weiyutang1010/ncrna_design.</description>

      <title>Open-source Polymer Generative Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers play a crucial role in the development of engineering materials, with applications ranging from mechanical to biomedical fields. However, the limited polymerization processes constrain the variety of organic building blocks that can be experimentally tested. We propose an open-source computational generative pipeline that integrates neural-network-based discriminators, generators, and query-based filtration mechanisms to overcome this limitation and generate hypothetical polymers. The pipeline targets properties, such as ionization potential (IP), by aligning various representational formats to generate hypothetical polymer candidates. The discriminators demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art models due to optimized architecture, while the generators produce novel polymers tailored to the desired property range. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the generative performance of the pipeline components, focusing on the polymers' ionization potential (IP). The developed pipeline is integrated into the DeepChem framework, enhancing its accessibility and compatibility for various polymer generation studies.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with other disordered systems, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven epistatic landscape. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions inspired by statistical physics, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the ancestral protein sequence from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself.</description>

      <title>Reversible molecular simulation for training classical and machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of force fields for molecular dynamics will be developed using a wealth of data. Training systematically with experimental data remains a challenge, however, especially for machine learning potentials. Differentiable molecular simulation calculates gradients of observables with respect to parameters through molecular dynamics trajectories. Here we improve this approach by explicitly calculating gradients using a reverse-time simulation with effectively constant memory cost and a computation count similar to the forward simulation. The method is applied to learn all-atom water and gas diffusion models with different functional forms, and to train a machine learning potential for diamond from scratch. Comparison to ensemble reweighting indicates that reversible simulation can provide more accurate gradients and train to match time-dependent observables.</description>
