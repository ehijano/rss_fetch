      <title>Biological Sequence Clustering: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to an explosive increase in biological sequence data, making sequence clustering a fundamental task in large-scale bioinformatics analyses. Unlike traditional clustering problems, biological sequence clustering faces unique challenges due to the lack of direct similarity measures, strict biological constraints, and demanding requirements for both scalability and accuracy. Over the past decades, a wide variety of methods have been developed, differing in how they model sequence similarity, construct clusters, and prioritize optimization objectives. In this review, we provide a comprehensive methodological overview of biological sequence clustering algorithms. We begin by summarizing the main strategies for modeling sequence similarity, which can be divided into three stages: sequence encoding, feature generation, and similarity measurement. Next, we discuss the major clustering paradigms, including greedy incremental, hierarchical, graph-based, model-based, partitional, and deep learning approaches, highlighting their methodological characteristics and practical trade-offs. We then discuss clustering objectives from three key perspectives: scalability and resource efficiency, biological interpretability, and robustness and clustering quality. Organizing existing methods along these dimensions allows us to explore the trade-offs in biological sequence clustering and clarify the contexts in which different approaches are most appropriate. Finally, we identify current limitations and challenges, providing guidance for researchers and directions for future method development.</description>

      <title>Robust Machine Learning for Regulatory Sequence Modeling under Biological and Technical Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust machine learning for regulatory genomics is studied under biologically and technically induced distribution shifts. Deep convolutional and attention based models achieve strong in distribution performance on DNA regulatory sequence prediction tasks but are usually evaluated under i.i.d. assumptions, even though real applications involve cell type specific programs, evolutionary turnover, assay protocol changes, and sequencing artifacts. We introduce a robustness framework that combines a mechanistic simulation benchmark with real data analysis on a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) dataset to quantify performance degradation, calibration failures, and uncertainty based reliability. In simulation, motif driven regulatory outputs are generated with cell type specific programs, PWM perturbations, GC bias, depth variation, batch effects, and heteroscedastic noise, and CNN, BiLSTM, and transformer models are evaluated. Models remain accurate and reasonably calibrated under mild GC content shifts but show higher error, severe variance miscalibration, and coverage collapse under motif effect rewiring and noise dominated regimes, revealing robustness gaps invisible to standard i.i.d. evaluation. Adding simple biological structural priors motif derived features in simulation and global GC content in MPRA improves in distribution error and yields consistent robustness gains under biologically meaningful genomic shifts, while providing only limited protection against strong assay noise. Uncertainty-aware selective prediction offers an additional safety layer that risk coverage analyses on simulated and MPRA data show that filtering low confidence inputs recovers low risk subsets, including under GC-based out-of-distribution conditions, although reliability gains diminish when noise dominates.</description>

      <title>engGNN: A Dual-Graph Neural Network for Omics-Based Disease Classification and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Omics data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes. However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.</description>

      <title>Efficient Imputation for Patch-based Missing Single-cell Data via Cluster-regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing data in single-cell sequencing datasets poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful biological insights. However, existing imputation approaches, which often assume uniformity and data completeness, struggle to address cases with large patches of missing data. In this paper, we present CROT, an optimal transport-based imputation algorithm designed to handle patch-based missing data in tabular formats. Our approach effectively captures the underlying data structure in the presence of significant missingness. Notably, it achieves superior imputation accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for large-scale datasets. This work introduces a robust solution for imputation in heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets with structured data absence, addressing critical challenges in both biological and clinical data analysis. Our code is available at Anomalous Github.</description>

      <title>SciHorizon-GENE: Benchmarking LLM for Life Sciences Inference from Gene Knowledge to Functional Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown growing promise in biomedical research, particularly for knowledge-driven interpretation tasks. However, their ability to reliably reason from gene-level knowledge to functional understanding, a core requirement for knowledge-enhanced cell atlas interpretation, remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SciHorizon-GENE, a large-scale gene-centric benchmark constructed from authoritative biological databases. The benchmark integrates curated knowledge for over 190K human genes and comprises more than 540K questions covering diverse gene-to-function reasoning scenarios relevant to cell type annotation, functional interpretation, and mechanism-oriented analysis. Motivated by behavioral patterns observed in preliminary examinations, SciHorizon-GENE evaluates LLMs along four biologically critical perspectives: research attention sensitivity, hallucination tendency, answer completeness, and literature influence, explicitly targeting failure modes that limit the safe adoption of LLMs in biological interpretation pipelines. We systematically evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical LLMs, revealing substantial heterogeneity in gene-level reasoning capabilities and persistent challenges in generating faithful, complete, and literature-grounded functional interpretations. Our benchmark establishes a systematic foundation for analyzing LLM behavior at the gene scale and offers insights for model selection and development, with direct relevance to knowledge-enhanced biological interpretation.</description>
