      <title>Affinization of dendriform $\md$-bialgebras, Lie bialgebras and solutions of classical Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly discuss how to use dendriform $\md$-bialgebras to construct Lie bialgebras and the relationship between the solutions of their corresponding Yang-Baxter equations. We provide two methods for obtaining Lie algebras from dendriform algebras using the tensor product with perm algebras, one by means of associative algebras and the other by means of pre-Lie algebras. We elevate both approaches to the level of bialgebras and prove that the Lie bialgebraa obtained using these two approaches are the same. There is a correspondence between symmetric solutions of the dendriform Yang-Baxter equation in dendriform algebras and certain skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in the Lie algebras induced from the dendriform algebras. The connections between triangular bialgebra structures, $\mathcal{O}$-operators related to the solutions of these Yang-Baxter equations are discussed in detail. During the discussion, we also present a method for constructing infinite-dimensional antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebra by using the affineization of dendriform $\md$-bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Explicit Determinants of Homogeneous Polynomial Evaluation Matrices and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the determinants of matrices constructed by evaluating homogeneous bivariate polynomials at pairs of vectors are investigated. For a polynomial $p(x,y)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^k \alpha_i x^{k-i}y^i$, an explicit factorization of the determinant of the associated $n\times n$ evaluation matrix $A_{\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}}(p(x,y))=\bigl[p(a_r,b_s)\bigr]_{r,s=1}^n$ is presented for all $n \ge k+1$ and for all pairs of vectors $\mathbf a=(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ and $\mathbf b=(b_1,\dots,b_n)$ of length $n$. In particular, it is proved that $\det (A_{\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}}(p(x,y)))=0$ when $n \ge k+2$, while in the borderline case $n=k+1$ a closed formula involving Vandermonde determinants is derived in the vector sets and the coefficients of $p(x,y)$. Several well-known determinants, including those arising from $(x+y)^k$ and classical quotient forms $\frac{a^k-b^k}{a-b}$ and $\frac{a^k+b^k}{a+b}$, emerge as special cases. We also provide a discussion for $n \le k$, connecting the problem to symmetric functions and generalized Vandermonde determinants. Finally, applications such matrices and determinants are provided, including an explicit formula and equivariance law under linear changes of variables for the sum-form \(p(x,y)=f(x+y)\), and a non-vanishing bound over finite fields via Schwartz-Zippel lemma.</description>

      <title>Quaternities, correspondences, and tetrahedron equations (Summa tetralogiae)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this note is:
  (a) to propose a generalization of tetrahedron equations from \cite{S} and of their solutions. Due to appearance of a larger number of parameters the $R$-matrices from \cite{S} will be replaced by "$R$-correspondences".
  (b) To rephrase these equations in terms of Wronskian evolutions in the spirit of \cite{SV}.
  (c) To discuss some elementary structures of cohomological flavour lying behind our considerations. We call them "quaternities", or "bibitorsors"; they might be not without an independent interest.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory IV: Morphisms, Equivalences, and Categorical Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the foundational architecture of Algebraic Phase Theory by developing a categorical and $2$-categorical framework for algebraic phases. Building on the structural notions introduced in Papers~I-III, we define phase morphisms, equivalence relations, and intrinsic invariants compatible with the canonical filtration and defect stratification.
  For finite, strongly admissible phases we establish strong rigidity theorems: phase morphisms are uniquely determined by their action on rigid cores, and under bounded defect, weak, strong, and Morita-type equivalence all coincide. In particular, finite strongly admissible phases admit no distinct models with the same filtered representation theory. We further show that structural boundaries are invariant under Morita-type equivalence and therefore constitute genuine categorical invariants.
  Algebraic phases, phase morphisms, and filtration-compatible natural transformations form a strict $2$-category in the strongly admissible regime. We also prove that completion defines a reflective localization of this category, with complete phases characterized as universal forced rigidifications.
  Together, these results elevate Algebraic Phase Theory from a collection of algebraic constructions to a categorical framework in which rigidity, equivalence collapse, boundary invariance, and completion arise as intrinsic consequences of phase interaction, finiteness, and admissibility.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory V: Boundary Calculus, Rigidity Islands, and Deformation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general boundary calculus for algebraic phases and use it to formulate an intrinsic and purely structural deformation theory. Structural boundaries are shown to be inevitable, finitely detectable, and canonically stratified by failure type and depth. For each boundary we construct a canonical boundary exact sequence and identify a unique maximal rigid subphase, called a \emph{rigidity island}, that persists beyond global boundary failure.
  Rigidity islands are classified by intrinsic invariants and serve as universal base points for deformation theory. All deformations are boundary-controlled, restrict trivially to rigidity islands, and are governed by boundary quotients, which act as universal obstruction objects. Infinitesimal and higher-order obstructions are finite, stratified by boundary depth, and terminate intrinsically.
  As a consequence, deformation directions are discrete, formal smoothness is equivalent to the vanishing of boundary data, and the moduli of algebraic phases form a stratified discrete groupoid indexed by rigidity islands. No analytic or continuous moduli parameters arise intrinsically.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory VI: Duality, Reconstruction, and Structural Toolkit Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any functorial finite-depth reconstruction framework based on representation theory satisfies a strict dichotomy: it either collapses into a rigid regime or necessarily admits intrinsic structural boundaries. In the non-rigid case, reconstruction is uniquely determined up to canonical boundary collapse, and no boundary-free reconstruction theory with the same formal properties can exist.
  We establish that algebraic phases are \emph{information-complete}. Any phase satisfying the axioms of Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) is uniquely determined, up to intrinsic phase equivalence, by its filtered representation category together with its boundary stratification. Reconstruction is exact on rigidity islands and fails globally only through canonical and unavoidable boundary phenomena.
  We further show that the axioms of APT force a minimal structural toolkit, including canonical finite generation, rigidity--obstruction equivalence, finite-depth boundary detectability, and the existence of universal obstruction objects. These results apply uniformly across all phase models developed in the APT series.
  Taken together, the results of this paper complete the foundational development of Algebraic Phase Theory and position it as a canonical and inevitable reconstruction framework extending classical duality theories beyond rigid and semisimple regimes.</description>

      <title>PALMA: A Lightweight Tropical Algebra Library for ARM-Based Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical algebra, including max-plus, min-plus, and related idempotent semirings, provides a unifying framework in which many optimization problems that are nonlinear in classical algebra become linear. This property makes tropical methods particularly well suited for shortest paths, scheduling, throughput analysis, and discrete event systems. Despite their theoretical maturity and practical relevance, existing tropical algebra implementations primarily target desktop or server environments and remain largely inaccessible on resource-constrained embedded platforms, where such optimization problems are most acute. We present PALMA (Parallel Algebra Library for Max-plus Applications), a lightweight, dependency-free C library that brings tropical linear algebra to ARM-based embedded systems. PALMA implements a generic semiring abstraction with SIMD-accelerated kernels, enabling a single computational framework to support shortest paths, bottleneck paths, reachability, scheduling, and throughput analysis. The library supports five tropical semirings, dense and sparse (CSR) representations, tropical closure, and spectral analysis via maximum cycle mean computation. We evaluate PALMA on a Raspberry Pi 4 and demonstrate peak performance of 2,274 MOPS, speedups of up to 11.9 times over classical Bellman-Ford for single-source shortest paths, and sub-10 microsecond scheduling solves for real-time control workloads. Case studies in UAV control, IoT routing, and manufacturing systems show that tropical algebra enables efficient, predictable, and unified optimization directly on embedded hardware. PALMA is released as open-source software under the MIT license.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how to formulate Voiculescu's non-commutative Riemann sphere framework for fully matricial functions \cite{v10} within the theory of nc functions developed by Vinnikov and Kaliuzhnyi-Verbovetskyi \cite{kvv14}. We then extend this framework from the Riemann sphere to Grassmannians (and flag manifolds). Moreover, as an example of nc functions in this setting, we introduce a generalization of Voiculescu's non-commutative resolvent on the Riemann sphere, study a corresponding generalization of the resolvent equation, and discuss aspects of the spectral analysis of unbounded operators in Voiculescu's framework \cite{v10}.</description>

Abstract: Dixmier property concerns the bijectivity of endomorphisms for algebras. We introduce a relative Dixmier property, which is a generalization of the Dixmier property. This new concept has applications in proving that several classes of Poisson algebras possess the Dixmier property, as well as in other topics such as the cancellation problem and the non-existence of Hopf coactions.</description>

Abstract: We develop a deformation theory for finite-dimensional left-symmetric color algebras, which can be used to construct new algebraic structures and interpret left-symmetric color cohomology spaces of lower degrees. We explore equivalence classes and extendability of deformations for a fixed left-symmetric color algebra, demonstrating that each infinitesimal deformation is nontrivially extendable if the third cohomology subspace of degree zero is trivial. We also study Nijenhuis operators and Rota-Baxter operators on a left-symmetric color algebra, providing a better understanding of the equivalence class of the trivial infinitesimal deformation.</description>

      <title>A Mnemonic Matrix Rule for (Split) Octonionic Multiplication and its Extension to the Cayley--Dickson Tower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a compact mnemonic device for computing the product of two (split) octonions written in Cayley--Dickson form q+l p with q,p in H. The rule appears as a simple (R+L) pattern of right-ordered and left-ordered (quaternionic) products inside a 2X2 quaternionic matrix model. The pattern extends verbatim to all algebras in the Cayley--Dickson tower, providing an efficient computational tool in non-associative settings. To our knowledge, this explicit ``(R+L)'' mnemonic does not appear in the classical literature on octonions or composition algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$, we exhibit a canonical structure of post-Lie algebra on the space $\mathcal{A}\otimes {\rm Der}(\mathcal{A})$ where ${\rm Der}(\mathcal{A})$ is the space of derivations on $\mathcal{A}$, in order to use the machinery given by Oudom-Guin (2008) and Ebrahimi-Fard--Lundervold--Munthe-Kaas (2015), and to define a Hopf algebra structure on the associated enveloping algebra with a natural action on $\mathcal{A}$. We apply these results to the setting of Linares-Otto-Tempelmayr (2023), giving a simpler and more efficient construction of their action and extending the recent work by Bruned-Katsetsiadis (2023). This approach gives an optimal setting to perform explicit computations in the associated structure group.</description>

Abstract: Zonotopal algebras (external, central, and internal) of an undirected graph G introduced by Postnikov-Shapiro and Holtz-Ron, are finite-dimensional commutative graded algebras whose Hilbert series contain a wealth of combinatorial information about G. In this paper, we associate to G a new family of algebras, which we call bizonotopal, because their definition involves doubling the set of edges of G. These algebras are monomial and have intricate properties related, among other things, to the combinatorics of graphical parking functions and their polytopes.
  Unlike the case of usual zonotopal algebras, the Hilbert series of bizonotopal algebras are not specializations of the Tutte polynomial of G. Still, we show that in the external and central cases these Hilbert series satisfy a modified deletion-contraction relation. In addition, we prove that the external bizonotopal algebra is a complete graph invariant.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative principal bundles and central extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the classical theory of spin structures, we develop a theory for lifting free C$^*$-dynamical systems, a.k.a. noncommutative principal bundles, along central extensions. This theory extends the bundle-theoretic notion of spin structures and yields a complete existence and classification result for such lifts. Using factor system techniques and Picard formalism, our approach introduces new invariants and obstruction classes, thereby unifying geometric, cohomological, and operator-algebraic perspectives. A range of examples demonstrates the scope of the theory.</description>

      <title>Computing quaternionic representations via twisted forms of Bruhat-Tits trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the study of representations of finite subgroups of the group of units of quaternion division algebras over a global or local field arising from the inclusion via extension of scalars splitting the algebra. Following a question by Serre, we study the set $\mathrm{IF}$ of conjugacy classes of integral representations that are conjugates of the given representation over the field. The set $\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields. For this, we devise and use a theory of twisted Galois form of Bruhat-Tits trees. With this tool, we explicitly compute, in most cases, the cardinality of $\mathrm{IF}$ for the representation of the classical quaternion group of order $8$ studied by Serre, Feit and others, as much as for other similar groups.</description>

      <title>On the Diophantine problem related to power circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</description>

      <title>Adventures of Harish-Chandra in $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$-graded world</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$ bi-graded Lie algebras. We describe their properties in relation to Lie superalgebras with some compatible structures. Then we focus on the approach to the Lie group--algebra correspondence based on Harish-Chandra pairs and provide some examples of application of it in the bi-graded setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Geometry on Severi-Brauer Schemes: Subsystem Reductions of Azumaya Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a defining signature and resource of quantum theory, but its standard definition presupposes a globally fixed decomposition into subsystems. We develop a geometric framework that detects when such a decomposition cannot be globalized for twisted families of pure-state spaces. Using Severi--Brauer schemes associated to Azumaya algebras over a base scheme, we study pure-state entanglement in families of projective state spaces that are locally trivial but globally twisted. For a given factorization type, we show that the existence of a global locus of product states is equivalent to a reduction of the underlying projective linear torsor to the stabilizer of the corresponding Segre variety, so entanglement in families becomes a geometric obstruction to globalizing subsystem structure.
  We construct the moduli space of subsystem structures, identify it with a natural torsor quotient, and realize it as a locally closed locus in the relative Hilbert scheme, yielding a canonical compactification by degenerations of product-state loci. In the bipartite case, once a subsystem structure is chosen, the Schmidt-rank stratification globalizes to a flat filtration with base-change compatible incidence resolutions and fiberwise constant numerical invariants. We complement this with Brauer-theoretic constraints and explicit examples showing that reducibility can depend on the underlying torsor rather than only on the Brauer class, with an interpretation via entangling monodromy.</description>
