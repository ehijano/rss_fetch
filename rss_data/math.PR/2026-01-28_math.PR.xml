      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for the Ewens-Pitman random partition in the large-$\theta$ regime via a martingale approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ewens-Pitman model defines a distribution on random partitions of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, with parameters $\alpha \in [0,1)$ and $\theta &gt; -\alpha$; the case $\alpha=0$ reduces to the classical Ewens model from population genetics. We investigate the large-$n$ asymptotic behaviour of the Ewens-Pitman random partition in the nonstandard regime $\theta=\lambda n$ with $\lambda&gt;0$, establishing joint fluctuation results for the total number of blocks $K_n^{\{n\}}$ and the counts $K_{r,n}^{\{n\}}$ of blocks of sizes $r=1,\dots,d$, for fixed $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, for $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and $\theta=\lambda n$, our main result provides a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the $(d+1)$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{K}_{d,n}^{\{n\}} = \bigl(K_n^{\{n\}}, K_{1,n}^{\{n\}}, \dots, K_{d,n}^{\{n\}}\bigr)^T$ as $n \to \infty$. The proof exploits the Chinese restaurant sequential construction under $\theta=\lambda n$ and a central limit theorem for triangular arrays of martingales, extending techniques previously developed for the classical regime with fixed $\theta$. As corollaries of our results, we recover known asymptotics for $K_n^{\{n\}}$ and derive new strong laws and central limit theorems for each fixed $K_{r,n}^{\{n\}}$, thereby completing earlier weak-law results and providing a comprehensive asymptotic description of the Ewens-Pitman partition structure in the large-$\theta$ setting.</description>

      <title>A universality property for large deviations of RWRE close to the axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general version of the strong KPZ universality conjecture near the axis for random walks in a random environment (RWRE) on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. For an i.i.d. elliptic random environment, we consider the quenched large deviations probabilities for trajectories starting at the origin and arriving at time $n+[n^a]$ to the position $(n,[n^a])$ and show that, if the logarithm of the right-jump probability has a finite moment of order $p&gt;2$, then for $a &lt; \frac{3}{7}(1-\frac{2}{p})$ the fluctuations of these propabilities are asymptotically governed by the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. Our results are based on a comparison between RWRE and a last passage percolation model, whose asymptotic fluctuations near the axis were previously established independently by Bodineau-Martin and Baik-Suidan. Furthermore, we obtain also the full convergence to the directed landscape in this regime based on the extension of the aforementioned results to this setting by McKeown and Zhang.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Interpretation of the Master Equation Arising from Mean Field Games with Jump Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the classical solution to the master equation arising from mean-field games (MFGs) driven by jump-diffusion processes. The master equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation on Wasserstein space, characterizes the value function of MFGs and is challenging to analyze directly due to its measure-valued derivatives. We propose a probabilistic interpretation using coupled McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with jumps. Under suitable Lipschitz and differentiability assumptions on the coefficients, we first establish the well-posedness of the MV-FBSDEs on a small time interval via a contraction mapping argument. We then prove the existence and regularity of the first- and second-order derivatives of the solutions with respect to the spatial and measure variables, relying on careful estimates involving jump terms and measure derivatives. Finally, we show that the decoupling field of the MV-FBSDEs satisfies the master equation in the classical sense, providing both existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our work extends earlier results on diffusion-driven MFGs to the jump-diffusion setting and offers a probabilistic framework for analyzing and numerically solving such kind of master equations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Persistence in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by infinite-dimensional ecological and biological models such as reaction-diffusion SPDEs and stochastic functional differential equations, we develop a general criteria for stochastic persistence (coexistence) in terms of an average lyapunov function, which was previously known only in finite dimensions. To apply our results to SPDEs we analyze the projective process, and we employ a combination of mild (stochastic convolution) and variational (lyapunov function) techniques. Our analysis also requires some nontrivial well-posedness and nonnegativity results for reaction-diffusion SPDEs, which we state and prove in great generality, extending the known results in the literature. Finally, we present several examples including ecological models (Lotka-Volterra), an epidemic model (SIR), and a model for turbulence. Notably we show that, as in the SDE case, coexistence in the Lotka-Volterra model is determined by the invasion rates.</description>

      <title>Hematopoiesis as a continuum: from stochastic compartmental model to hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multiscale stochastic compartmental model with three types of cells (stem cells, immature cells and mature cells) which combines cell proliferation and cell differentiation. We derive a hydrodynamic limit when the number of immature compartments goes to infinity obtaining a partial differential equations system with boundary conditions, modelling hematopoiesis as a continuum. We assume that proliferation and differentiation are regulated and let the corresponding rates depend on the number of mature cells. This leads us to model the dynamics of the population by a Markov process in continuous time and discrete space, which does not satisfy the branching property. We prove the convergence in law of the stem and mature cells population size processes and of the empirical measures of the immature cells dynamics, conveniently rescaled, to the unique triplet involving coupled functions and a measure, which are solutions of a deterministic measure valued equation with boundary dynamics. The cell differentiation induces a transport term in space and the main difficulty comes from the boundary effects coming from stem and mature cells. We also prove that the limiting measure admits at each time a density with respect to Lebesgue measure and can be characterized as solution of a partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Positive autocorrelation at unit lag for stationary random walk Metropolis-Hastings in ${\mathbb R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often asserted in the literature that one should expect positive autocorrelation for random walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH), especially if the typical proposal step-size is small relative to the variability in the target density. In this paper, we consider a stationary RWMH chain ${\bf X}$ taking values in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space and (subject only to the existence of densities with respect to Lebesgue measure) with general target distribution having finite second moment and general proposal random walk step-distribution. We prove, for any nonzero vector ${\bf c}$, strict positivity of the autocorrelation function at unit lag for the stochastic process $\langle{\bf c},{\bf X}\rangle$, that is, \[{\operatorname{Corr}}(\langle{\bf c},{\bf X}_0\rangle,\langle{\bf c},{\bf X}_1\rangle)&gt;0,\] and we establish the same result, but with weak inequality (which can in some cases be equality) when the state space for ${\bf X}$ is changed to the integer grid ${\mathbb Z}^d$. Further, for ${\bf c}\neq{\bf 0}$ we establish the sharp lower bound \[{\operatorname{Corr}}(\langle{\bf c},{\bf X}_0\rangle,\langle{\bf c},{\bf X}_1\rangle)&gt;\tfrac19\] on autocorrelation when we assume both that (i) the target density $\pi$ is spherically symmetric and unimodal in the specific sense that $\pi({\bf x})=\hat{\pi}(\|{\bf x}\|)$ for some nonincreasing function $\hat{\pi}$ on $[0,\infty)$ and that (ii) the proposal step-density is symmetric about ${\bf 0}$.
  We study the autocorrelation indirectly, by considering the incremental variance function (or incremental second-moment function) at unit lag. The same approach allows us also for $r\in[2,\infty)$ to upper-bound the incremental $r$th-absolute-moment function at unit lag.
  We give also closely related inequalities for the total variation distance between two distributions on ${\mathbb R}^d$ differing only by a location shift.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for maximal displacement of random walks on groups of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Gaussian concentration inequalities for maximal displacement of compactly supported random walks on a compactly generated locally compact group with polynomial growth. Concentration inequalities with different exponents hold for non-centred random walks as well, after correction by the drift.
  When the support of the measure generates a virtually nilpotent group, we provide an effective version of this result. These more refined estimates rely on the existence of a ``quantitative splitting'' of a virtually simply connected nilpotent group, a result which may be of independent interest.
  As applications, we deduce that the same concentration inequalities hold for centred random walks on the following classes of groups: amenable connected Lie groups (including non-unimodular ones), polycyclic and more generally finitely generated solvable groups with finite Pr\"ufer rank. This shows in particular that centred random walk are diffusive on such groups. For polycyclic groups, this strengthens and completes partial results previously obtained by Russ Thompson in 2011.</description>

      <title>P-Sensitive Functions and Localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper assumes a robust stochastic model where a set $\mathcal{P}$ of probability measures replaces the single probability measure of dominated models. We introduce and study $\mathcal{P}$-sensitive functions defined on robust function spaces of random variables. We show that $\mathcal{P}$-sensitive functions are precisely those that admit a representation via so-called functional localization. The theory is applied to solving robust optimization problems, to convex risk measures, and to the study of no arbitrage in robust one-period financial models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interface of covered and vacant sets in the subcritical phase of a scale-invariant Poisson stick soup on the plane. This model is a natural candidate for scaling limit of some planar models and has connections with long-range percolation on the plane with critical parameter $s=4$. We analyze a family of exploration paths on boxes and prove tightness for this family and Holder continuity for its limiting measures.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of Gaussian multiplicative chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a logarithmically-correlated Gaussian field $X$ in $d$ dimensions. For all $\gamma \in (-\sqrt{2d},\sqrt{2d})$, we show that the derivatives $\frac{\partial^k}{\partial\gamma^k} :e^{\gamma X_\epsilon}:$ of the regularised Gaussian multiplicative chaos $:e^{\gamma X_\epsilon}:$ converge as $\epsilon \to 0$. By deriving optimal bounds on their growth as $k\to\infty$, we control the power expansion of $:e^{\gamma X_\epsilon}:$ about each $\gamma\in(-\sqrt{2d},\sqrt{2d})$. This yields an alternative approach to complex Gaussian multiplicative chaos in the whole subcritical regime, based entirely on real-valued quantities.
  One of our key technical contributions is to provide a truncated second moment approach to the uniform integrability of the derivatives of multiplicative chaos and its associated complex variant.</description>

      <title>Mass generation for the two dimensional O(N) Linear Sigma Model in the large N limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the $O(N)$ Linear Sigma Model on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ under a scaling dictated by the formal $1/N$ expansion. We show that in the large $N$ limit, correlations decay exponentially fast, where the acquired mass decays exponentially in the inverse temperature. In fact, each marginal converges to a massive Gaussian Free Field (GFF) on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, quantified in the $2$-Wasserstein distance with a weighted $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ cost function. In contrast to prior work on the torus via parabolic stochastic quantization, our results hold without restrictions on the coupling constants, allowing us to also obtain a massive GFF in a suitable double scaling limit. Our proof combines the Feyel/\"Ust\"unel extension of Talagrand's inequality with some classical tools in Euclidean Quantum Field Theory.</description>

      <title>Computing the density of the Kesten-Stigum limit in supercritical Galton-Watson processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel numerical method for computing the density of the limit random variable associated with a supercritical Galton-Watson process. This random variable captures the effect of early demographic fluctuations and determines the random amplitude of long-term exponential population growth. While the existence of a non-trivial limit is ensured by the Kesten-Stigum theorem, computing its density in a stable and efficient manner for arbitrary offspring laws remains a significant challenge. The proposed approach leverages a functional equation that characterizes the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the limit distribution and combines it with a moment-matching method to obtain accurate approximations within a class of linear combinations of Laguerre polynomials with exponential damping. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on several examples in which the offspring generating function is a polynomial of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for non-trace class noise and applications to SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of stochastic PDEs with colored, non-trace class space-time noise, one frequently encounters Gaussian series of the form $$ \sum_{n\geq 1} \gamma_n \mu_n f_n, $$ where $(\gamma_n)_{n}$ is a sequence of standard independent Gaussian variables, $g$ is an $L^\eta(\mathcal{O})$ function, $(\mu_n)_{n}$ is a sequence of scalars, and $(f_n)_n$ is an orthonormal system in $L^2(\mathcal{O})$ where $\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is an open set. In this manuscript, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the above sum to converge in Bessel potential spaces $H^{-s,q}(\mathcal{O})$. The latter can be interpreted as a Sobolev embedding for Gaussian series. Our main theorem is formulated using weighted sequence spaces that encode the $L^\infty$-growth of the orthonormal system $(f_n)_{n}$, a feature that is crucial for obtaining sharp estimates. We apply our results to the stochastic heat equation with additive non-trace class noise. In this case, our conditions capture the scaling relationship between the heat operator and the coloring of the noise.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete characterization of indicator variograms and madograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indicator variograms and madograms are structural tools used in many disciplines of the natural sciences and engineering to describe random sets and random fields. To date, several necessary conditions are known for a function to be a valid indicator variogram but, except for intractable corner-positive inequalities, a complete characterization of indicator variograms is missing. Likewise, only partial characterizations of madograms are known. This paper provides novel necessary and sufficient conditions for a given function to be the variogram of an indicator random field with constant mean value or to be the madogram of a random field, and establishes under which conditions these two families of functions coincide. Our results apply to any set of points where the random field is defined and rely on distance geometry and Gaussian random field theory.</description>

      <title>Deep g-Pricing for CSI 300 Index Options with Volatility Trajectories and Market Sentiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Option pricing in real markets faces fundamental challenges. The Black--Scholes--Merton (BSM) model assumes constant volatility and uses a linear generator $g(t,x,y,z)=-ry$, while lacking explicit behavioral factors, resulting in systematic departures from observed dynamics. This paper extends the BSM model by learning a nonlinear generator within a deep Forward--Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE) framework. We propose a dual-network architecture where the value network $u_\theta$ learns option prices and the generator network $g_\phi$ characterizes the pricing mechanism, with the hedging strategy $Z_t=\sigma_t X_t \nabla_x u_\theta$ obtained via automatic differentiation. The framework adopts forward recursion from a learnable initial condition $Y_0=u_\theta(0,\cdot)$, naturally accommodating volatility trajectory and sentiment features. Empirical results on CSI 300 index options show that our method reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 32.2\% and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 35.3\% compared with BSM. Interpretability analysis indicates that architectural improvements are effective across all option types, while the information advantage is asymmetric between calls and puts. Specifically, call option improvements are primarily driven by sentiment features, whereas put options show more balanced contributions from volatility trajectory and sentiment features. This finding aligns with economic intuition regarding option pricing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Average-Case Reductions for $k$-XOR and Tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two canonical planted average-case problems -- noisy $k\mathsf{\text{-}XOR}$ and Tensor PCA -- and relate their computational properties via poly-time average-case reductions. In fact, we consider a \emph{family of problems} that interpolates between $k\mathsf{\text{-}XOR}$ and Tensor PCA, allowing intermediate densities and signal levels. We introduce two \emph{densifying} reductions that increase the number of observed entries while controlling the decrease in signal, and, in particular, reduce any $k\mathsf{\text{-}XOR}$ instance at the computational threshold to Tensor PCA at the computational threshold. Additionally, we give new order-reducing maps (e.g., $5\to 4$ $k\mathsf{\text{-}XOR}$ and $7\to 4$ Tensor PCA) at fixed entry density.</description>

      <title>Exact calculations beyond charge neutrality in timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\alpha_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\sqrt{2},\mu)=e(4\pi\sqrt2 \mu)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\alpha_j=\frac{1}{2}Q+\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature. These results provide the first rigorously controlled family of exact calculations in timelike Liouville theory outside charge neutrality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is of significant interest to understand whether a noise will speed up or prevent blow up. Under certain nondegenerate conditions, \cite{dD2005Blowup} proved a multiplicative noise will speed up blow up of NLS, in the sense that, blow up can happen in any short time with positive probability. We prove that such probability is indeed quite small, and provide a large deviation type upper bound.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for Some Stochastic Orders of Discrete Random Variables with Applications in Reliability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on providing sufficient conditions for some well-known stochastic orders in reliability but dealing with the discrete versions of them, filling a gap in the literature. In particular, we find conditions based on the unimodality of the likelihood ratio for the comparison in some stochastic orders of two discrete random variables. These results have interest in comparing discrete random variables because the sufficient conditions are easy to check when there are no closed expressions for the survival functions, which occurs in many cases. In addition, the results are applied to compare several parametric families of discrete distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish connections between the absorption probabilities of a class of birth-death processes with killing, and the stationary tail of a related class of birth-death processes with catastrophes. The major ingredients of the proofs are a decomposition of the dynamics of these processes, a Feynman--Kac type relationship for Markov chains with reset and rebirth, and the concept of Siegmund duality, which allows us to invert the relationship between the processes. We apply our results to a pair of ancestral processes in population genetics, namely the killed ancestral selection graph and the pruned lookdown ancestral selection graph, in a finite population setting and its diffusion limit.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of L\'evy tax processes with bailouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider controlling the paths of a spectrally negative L\'evy process by two means: the subtraction of `taxes' when the process is at an all-time maximum, and the addition of `bailouts' which keep the value of the process above zero. We solve the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem of maximising the expected present value of the difference between taxes received and cost of bailouts given. Our class of taxation controls is larger than has been considered up till now in the literature and makes the problem truly two-dimensional rather than one-dimensional. Along the way, we define and characterise a large class of controlled L\'evy processes to which the optimal solution belongs, which extends a known result for perturbed Brownian motions to the case of a general L\'evy process with no positive jumps.</description>

      <title>Total disconnectedness and percolation for the supports of super-tree random measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-tree random measures (STRMs) were introduced by Allouba, Durrett, Hawkes and Perkins as a simple stochastic model which emulates a superprocess at a fixed time. A STRM $\nu$ arises as the a.s. limit of a sequence of empirical measures for a discrete time particle system which undergoes independent supercritical branching and independent random displacement (spatial motion) of children from their parents. We study the connectedness properties of the closed support of a STRM ($\mathrm{supp}(\nu)$) for a particular choice of random displacement. Our main results are distinct sufficient conditions for the a.s. total disconnectedness (TD) of $\mathrm{supp}(\nu)$, and for percolation on $\mathrm{supp}(\nu)$ which will imply a.s. existence of a non-trivial connected component in $\mathrm{supp}(\nu)$. We illustrate a close connection between a subclass of these STRM's and super-Brownian motion (SBM). For these particular STRM's the above results give a.s. TD of the support in three and higher dimensions and the existence of a non-trivial connected component in two dimensions, with the three-dimensional case being critical. The latter two-dimensional result assumes that $p_c(\mathbb{Z}^2)$, the critical probability for site percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, is less than $1-e^{-1}$. (There is strong numerical evidence supporting this condition although the known rigorous bounds fall just short.) This gives evidence that the same connectedness properties should hold for SBM. The latter remains an interesting open problem in dimensions $2$ and $3$ ever since it was first posed by Don Dawson over $30$ years ago.</description>

      <title>Convergence and stationary distribution of Elo rating systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Elo rating system is a popular and widely adopted method for measuring the relative skill levels of players or teams in various sports and competitions. It assigns players numerical ratings and dynamically updates them based on game results and a model parameter $K$, which determines the sensitivity of rating changes. Assuming random games, this leads to a Markov chain for the evolution of the ratings of the $N$ players in the league. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the long-term behavior of this process. Aiming to fill this gap, in this article we prove that the process converges to its unique equilibrium distribution at an exponential rate in the 2-Wasserstein distance and almost surely. Moreover, we show important properties of the stationary distribution, such as the finiteness of an exponential moment, full support, and convergence to the players' true skills as $K$ decreases, at a rate of $\sqrt{K}$. We also provide Monte Carlo simulations that illustrate some of these properties and offer new insights.</description>

      <title>Freidlin-Wentzell solutions of discrete Hamilton Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of finite irreducible Markov chains with exponentially small transition rates: the transition graph is a fixed, finite, strongly connected directed graph; the transition rates decay exponentially on a paramenter N with a given rate that varies from edge to edge. The stationary equation uniquely identifies the invariant measure for each N, but at exponential scale in the limit as N goes to infinity reduces to a discrete equation for the large deviation rate functional of the invariant measure, that in general has not an unique solution. In analogy with the continuous case of diffusions, we call such equation a discrete Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Likewise in the continuous case we introduce a notion of viscosity supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions and give a detailed geometric characterization of the solutions in terms of special faces of the polyedron of Lipschitz functions on the transition graph. This parallels the weak KAM theory in a purely discrete setting. We identify also a special vanishing viscosity solution obtained in the limit from the combinatorial representation of the invariant measure given by the matrix tree theorem. The result gives a selection principle on the set of solutions to the discrete Hamilton-Jacobi equation obtained by the Freidlin and Wentzell minimal arborescences construction; this enlightens and parallels what happens in the continuous setting.</description>

      <title>On empty balls of critical 2-dimensional branching random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{Z_n\}_{n\geq 0 }$ be a critical $d$-dimensional branching random walk started from a Poisson random measure whose intensity measure is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Denote by $R_n:=\sup\{u&gt;0:Z_n(\{x\in\mathbb{R}^d:|x|&lt;u\})=0\}$ the radius of the largest empty ball centered at the origin of $Z_n$. In \cite{reves02}, R\'ev\'esz shows that if $d=1$, then $R_n/n$ converges in law to an exponential random variable as $n\to\infty$. Moreover, R\'ev\'esz (2002) conjectured that
  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{R_n}{\sqrt n}\overset{\text{law}}=\text{non-trival~distri.,}~d=2; \lim_{n\to\infty}{R_n}\overset{\text{law}}=\text{non-trival~distri.,}~d\geq3.$$ Later, Hu (2005) \cite{hu05} confirmed the case of $d\geq3$. This work confirms the case of $d=2$. It turns out that the limit distribution can be precisely characterized through the super-Brownian motion. Moreover, we also give complete results of empty balls of the branching random walk with infinite second moment offspring law. As a by-product, this article also improves the assumption of maximal displacements of branching random walks \cite[Theorem 1]{lalley2015}.</description>

      <title>On the contraction properties of Sinkhorn semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel stability theory for Sinkhorn semigroups based on Lyapunov techniques and quantitative contraction coefficients, and establish exponential convergence of Sinkhorn iterations on weighted Banach spaces. This operator-theoretic framework yields explicit exponential decay rates of Sinkhorn iterates toward Schr\"odinger bridges with respect to a broad class of $\phi$-divergences and Kantorovich-type distances, including relative entropy, squared Hellinger integrals, $\alpha$-divergences, weighted total variation norms, and Wasserstein distances. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first systematic contraction inequalities of this kind for entropic transport and the Sinkhorn algorithm. We further introduce Lyapunov contraction principles under minimal regularity assumptions, leading to quantitative exponential stability estimates for a large family of Sinkhorn semigroups. The framework applies to models with polynomially growing potentials and heavy-tailed marginals on general normed spaces, as well as to more structured boundary state-space models, including semicircle transitions and Beta, Weibull, and exponential marginals, together with semi-compact settings. Finally, our approach extends naturally to statistical finite mixtures of such models, including kernel-based density estimators arising in modern generative modeling.</description>

Abstract: We derive an Ito-type change-of-variables formula for stochastic processes admitting a causal derivation-divergence representation. The result applies to a broad class of non-semimartingale and rough processes, including Gaussian models with irregular covariance structure. The Ito correction term is expressed explicitly through a product rule for divergences rather than through quadratic variation. This formulation provides a unified operator-theoretic representation of classical and generalized Ito formulas.</description>

Abstract: We consider individuals of two species distributed over m patches, each with a hosting capacity $d_i N$ , where $d_i \in (0, 1]$. We assume that all the patches are linked by the dispersal of individuals. This work examines how the metacommunity evolves in these patches. The model incorporates Wright-Fisher intra-patch reproduction and a general exchange function representing dispersal. Under minimal assumptions, we demonstrate that as $N$ approaches infinity, the processes converge to a diffusion process for which we establish the Feller property. We prove that the limiting process almost surely reaches the absorbing states in finite time.</description>

In the multivariate case, these fluctuations take the form of non central Wishart type perturbations, which significantly complicate the mathematical analysis. We establish non asymptotic, time-uniform stability and error estimates for the ensemble covariance matrix processes under minimal structural assumptions on the signal observation model, allowing for possibly unstable dynamics. Our results quantify the impact of ensemble size, dimension, and observation noise, and provide explicit bounds on the propagation of stochastic errors over long time horizons. The analysis relies on a detailed study of stochastic Riccati difference equations driven by matrix-valued noncentral Wishart fluctuations. Beyond their relevance to data assimilation, these results contribute to the probabilistic understanding of ensemble-based filtering methods in high dimension and offer new tools for the analysis of interacting particle systems with matrix-valued dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Hedging with Iterated Integrals and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10166v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive an $L^p$-chaos expansion based on iterated Stratonovich integrals with respect to a given exponentially integrable continuous semimartingale. By omitting the orthogonality of the expansion, we show that every $p$-integrable functional, $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be approximated by a finite sum of iterated Stratonovich integrals. Using (possibly random) neural networks as integrands, we therefere obtain universal approximation results for $p$-integrable financial derivatives in the $L^p$-sense. Moreover, we can approximately solve the $L^p$-hedging problem (coinciding for $p = 2$ with the quadratic hedging problem), where the approximating hedging strategy can be computed in closed form within short runtime.</description>

      <title>Green geometry, Martin boundary and random walk asymptotics on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a single computationally checkable analytic quantity interlacing Martin boundary collapse, Green geometry, and linear escape for transient random walks on finitely generated groups: the Green-variation functional \[ \Delta(S;a,b):=\max_{x\in\partial S}\frac{|G(a,x)-G(b,x)|}{G(a,x)}. \] We prove that $\Delta\to0$ along exhaustions characterises the strong Liouville property (under mild, verifiable hypotheses on the ``strong Liouville $\Rightarrow \Delta\to0$'' direction), turning boundary oscillation estimates for Green kernels into potential-theoretic rigidity.
  We then give two general criteria for $\Delta$-vanishing. The first one derives quantitative bounds on $\Delta$ from coarse heat-kernel envelopes at an intrinsic scale together with a Tauberian comparability, covering Gaussian/sub-Gaussian and stable-like regimes; and the second one is purely elliptic: an ``elliptic H\"older exhaustion'' criterion. Conversely, on groups of exponential growth, $\Delta$ fails to decay along balls already under stretched-exponential on-diagonal upper bounds, yielding a quantitative obstruction to strong Liouville.
  As consequences, trivial Martin boundary forces linear-scale collapse of Green geometry ($d_G(e,x)=o(|x|)$) and vanishing Green speed (in probability), without any entropy hypothesis. On the non-Liouville side we prove an abundance principle: the existence of a single minimal positive harmonic function at a prescribed growth scale forces infinitely many. Finally, we clarify the role of moment assumptions in speed theory: any linear-speed law of large numbers on a set of positive probability forces $\mathbb E|X_1|&lt;\infty$, while on torsion-free nilpotent groups one can have $\mathbb E|X_1|=\infty$ yet $|X_n|/n\to0$ in probability.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for output range analysis for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the output range estimation problem in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by integrating a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm tailored to operate within constrained domains and ensure convergence towards global optima. The method effectively addresses the challenges posed by the lack of local geometric information and the high non-linearity inherent to DNNs, making it applicable to a wide variety of architectures, with a special focus on Residual Networks (ResNets) due to their practical importance. Unlike existing methods, our algorithm imposes minimal assumptions on the internal architecture of neural networks, thereby extending its usability to complex models. Theoretical analysis guarantees convergence, while extensive empirical evaluations-including optimization tests involving functions with multiple local minima-demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm in navigating non-convex response surfaces. The experimental results highlight the algorithm's efficiency in accurately estimating DNN output ranges, even in scenarios characterized by high non-linearity and complex constraints. For reproducibility, Python codes and datasets used in the experiments are publicly available through our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Average sizes of mixed character sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the average size of a mixed character sum $$\sum_{1\le n \le x} \chi(n) e(n\theta) w(n/x)$$ (for a suitable smooth function $w$) is on the order of $\sqrt{x}$ for all irrational real $\theta$ satisfying a weak Diophantine condition, where $\chi$ is drawn from the family of Dirichlet characters modulo a large prime $r$ and where $x\le r$. In contrast, it was proved by Harper that the average size is $o(\sqrt{x})$ for rational $\theta$. Certain quadratic Diophantine equations play a key role in the present paper.</description>

      <title>Wiener-type Criterion for the Removability of the Fundamental Singularity for the Heat Equation and its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the removability of the fundamental singularity, and equivalently for the unique solvability of the singular Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. In the measure-theoretical context, the criterion determines whether the $h$-parabolic measure of the singularity point is null or positive. From the probabilistic point of view, the criterion presents an asymptotic law for conditional Brownian motion. In {\it U.G. Abdulla, J Math Phys, 65, 121503 (2024)} the Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-type test was established. Here, we prove a new Wiener-type criterion for the "geometric" characterization of the removability of the fundamental singularity for arbitrary open sets in terms of the fine-topological thinness of the complementary set near the singularity point. In the special case when the boundary of the open set is locally represented by a graph, the minimal thinness criterion for the removability of the singularity is expressed in terms of the minimal regularity of the boundary manifold at the singularity point.</description>

      <title>Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Concept activation vectors: a unifying view and adversarial attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are a tool from explainable AI, offering a promising approach for understanding how human-understandable concepts are encoded in a model's latent spaces. They are computed from hidden-layer activations of inputs belonging either to a concept class or to non-concept examples. Adopting a probabilistic perspective, the distribution of the (non-)concept inputs induces a distribution over the CAV, making it a random vector in the latent space. This enables us to derive mean and covariance for different types of CAVs, leading to a unified theoretical view. This probabilistic perspective also reveals a potential vulnerability: CAVs can strongly depend on the rather arbitrary non-concept distribution, a factor largely overlooked in prior work. We illustrate this with a simple yet effective adversarial attack, underscoring the need for a more systematic study.</description>
