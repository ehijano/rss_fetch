      <title>On the difference between squares and integral $S$-units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q_1, \ldots , q_t$ be distinct prime numbers. Let $a_1, \ldots , a_t$ be nonnegative integers and $x$ a positive integer. We establish an effective lower bound for the greatest prime divisor of $|x^2 - q_1^{a_1} \ldots q_t^{a_t}|$, which tends to infinity with the maximum of $x$, $a_1, \ldots , a_t$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Structure of Permutational Polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that there exists a significant equivalence between the vector space $\mathbb{F}_{q}^n$ and the finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$, and many scholars often view them as the same in most contexts. However, the precise connections between them still remain mysterious. In this paper, we first show their connections from an algebraic perspective, and then propose a more general algebraic framework theorem. Furthermore, as an application of this generalized algebraic structure, we give some classes of permutation polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$.</description>

      <title>On a property of the polynomials $x^n + (1-x)^n + a^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polynomials $x^n + (1-x)^n + a^n$ arise naturally from FLT (Fermat's Last Theorem). We formulate a conjecture about them which is a generalization of FLT. We investigate the complex roots of these polynomials, and our main result is that in the cases $|a|\leq \frac12$ and $a=-1$, they lie on an explicitly given curve while 'filling in' that curve. We hypothesize that this property can be generalized to hold for other $a$ as well.</description>

      <title>Random walks through the areal Mahler measure: steps in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the areal Mahler measure of the two-variable, $k$-parameter family $x+y+k$ and prove explicit formulas that demonstrate its relation to the standard Mahler measure of these polynomials. The proofs involve interpreting the areal Mahler measure as a random walk in the complex plane and utilizing the areal analogue of the Zeta Mahler function to arrive at the result. Using similar techniques, we also present formulas for a three-variable family $(x+1)(y+1)+kz$ in terms of the standard Mahler measure, along with terms that involve certain hypergeometric functions. For both families we show that its areal Mahler measure is, up to elementary functions, a linear combination of the normal Mahler measure and the volume of the Deninger cycle of the corresponding family.</description>

Abstract: We provide a superalgebraic analogue of Markov numbers, which are defined as the Grassmann integer solutions to the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (xy + yz + xz)\epsilon = 3(1 + \epsilon)xyz$, as well as applications to the Decorated Super Teichm\"uller spaces associated to the once-punctured torus and certain annuli. We conclude with further directions for study.</description>

      <title>Trimmed ergodic sums for non-integrable functions with power singularities over irrational rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying Birkhoff sums of non-integrable functions involves the challenge of large observations depending on the sampled orbit, which prevents pointwise limit theorems. To address this issue, the largest observations are removed, this process is commonly known as trimming. While this method is well studied for independent identically distributed sequences and systems with strong mixing behaviour, this paper focuses on irrational rotations of $\mathbb{T}$. In this setting we establish trimmed weak and strong laws for the functions $\frac{1}{x}$ and $\frac{1}{x^{\beta}}$ with $\beta&gt;1$, providing explicit conditions on the rotation angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ be an exponential period. We show that the real and imaginary part of $\alpha$ are up to signs volumes of sets definable in the o-minimal structure generated by $\mathbb{Q}$, the real exponential function and ${\sin}|_{[0,1]}$. This is a weaker analogue of the precise characterisation of ordinary periods as numbers whose real and imaginary part are up to signs volumes of $\mathbb{Q}$-semi-algebraic sets. Furthermore, we define a notion of naive exponential periods and compare it to the existing notions using cohomological methods. This points to a relation between the theory of periods and o-minimal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivalence classes of positive definite binary quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Z}$ having bounded discriminant $\Delta = 1-4p$, with $p$ a prime. This extends work of the first named author and has an application in counting simple $(4a+1)$-knots of genus one.</description>

      <title>On the moments of one-level densities in families of holomorphic cusp forms in the level aspect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $n^{\rm th}$ centered moments of the $1$-level density for the low-lying zeros of $L$-functions attached to holomorphic cuspidal newforms of large prime level and fixed weight. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypotheses, we compute this statistic for any $n\ge 1$ and for all test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-2/n, \, 2/n\right)$. This is believed to be the natural limit of the current technology. Our work significantly extends beyond the trivial range $(-1/n, \, 1/n)$ and surpasses the previous record of $(-1/(n-1),\, 1/(n-1))$ whenever $n&gt;2$. The Katz-Sarnak philosophy predicts that the aforementioned statistic can be modeled by the corresponding statistic for the eigenvalues of random orthogonal matrices. We prove that this is the case for test functions with Fourier support contained in $(-2/n,\, 2/n)$. The main technical innovation is a tractable vantage to evaluate the combinatorial zoo of terms, similar to the work of Conrey-Snaith and Mason-Snaith. As an application, our work provides better bounds on the order of vanishing at the central point for the $L$-functions in our family.</description>

      <title>On endomorphism algebras of $\text{GL}_2$-type abelian varieties and Diophantine applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be two different newforms without complex multiplication having the same coefficient field. The main result of the present article proves that a congruence between the Galois representations attached to $f$ and to $g$ for a large prime $p$ implies an isomorphism between the endomorphism algebras of the abelian varieties $A_f$ and $A_g$ attached to $f$ and $g$ by the Eichler-Shimura construction. This implies important relations between their building blocks. A non-trivial application of our result is that for all prime numbers $d$ congruent to $3$ modulo $8$ satisfying that the class number of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ is prime to $3$, the equation $x^4+dy^2 =z^p$ has no non-trivial primitive solutions when $p$ is large enough. We prove a similar result for the equation $x^2+dy^6=z^p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the average size of a mixed character sum $$\sum_{1\le n \le x} \chi(n) e(n\theta) w(n/x)$$ (for a suitable smooth function $w$) is on the order of $\sqrt{x}$ for all irrational real $\theta$ satisfying a weak Diophantine condition, where $\chi$ is drawn from the family of Dirichlet characters modulo a large prime $r$ and where $x\le r$. In contrast, it was proved by Harper that the average size is $o(\sqrt{x})$ for rational $\theta$. Certain quadratic Diophantine equations play a key role in the present paper.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again study a surprising connection between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field of degree $n&gt;1$ and $d&gt;2$ an integer. As in \cite{BK1}, we wish to study counting problems which are inspired by exciting advances in arithmetic statistics, and also partly by a point-counting result of Narkiewicz on real $K$-periodic points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we prove that for any given prime integer $p\geq 3$ and any integer $\ell \geq 1$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo a prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ where $K$ is a real algebraic number field of any degree $n\geq 2$ is $3$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. Motivated further by a $K$-rational periodic point-counting result of Benedetto on any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ for any given prime integer $p\geq 5$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove unconditionally that the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{(p-1)^{\ell}, c}$ modulo a prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ where $K$ is any number field (not necessarily real) of degree $n\geq 2$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. Finally, we then apply counting and statistical results from arithmetic statistics to then deduce here several counting and statistical results; and among them includes applying here a more recent number field-counting result of Oliver Lemke-Thorne to bound above the number of number fields $K_{f}$ of degree $m:= np^{\ell}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant; and similarly also bound above the number of number fields $L_{g}$ of degree $r:= n(p-1)^{\ell}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ with bounded discriminant.</description>

      <title>Hasse norm principle for metacyclic extensions with trivial Schur multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quoternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=|G^{ab}|/|H^{ab}|$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(G_m)$ of $K/k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$ where $G^{ab}$ and $H^{ab}$ are the abelianizations of $G$ and $H$ respectively, $\widehat{T}={\rm Hom}(T,G_m)$ is the character module of $T$ and $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$.</description>

      <title>On the Bloch-Kato conjecture for some four-dimensional symplectic Galois representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bloch-Kato conjecture predicts a far-reaching connection between orders of vanishing of $L$-functions and the ranks of Selmer groups of $p$-adic Galois representations. In this article, we consider the four-dimensional, symplectic Galois representations arising from automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GSp}_4(\mathbb A_{\mathbb Q})$ with trivial central character and with the lowest cohomological archimedean weight. Under mild technical conditions, we prove that the Selmer group vanishes when the central value $L(\pi,\mathrm{spin},1/2)$ is nonzero. In the spirit of bipartite Euler systems, we bound the Selmer group by using level-raising congruences to construct ramified Galois cohomology classes. The relation to $L$-values comes via the $\mathrm{GSpin}_3\hookrightarrow \mathrm{GSpin}_5$ periods on a compact inner form of $\mathrm{GSp}_4$. We also prove a result towards the rank-one case: if the $\pi$-isotypic part of the Abel-Jacobi image of any of Kudla's one-cycles on the Siegel threefold is nonzero, it generates the full Selmer group. These cycles are linear combinations of embedded quaternionic Shimura curves, and under the conjectural arithmetic Rallis inner product formula, their heights are related to $L'(\pi,\mathrm{spin},1/2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $t(N)$ denote the largest number such that $N!$ can be expressed as the product of $N$ numbers greater than or equal to $t(N)$. The bound $t(N)/N = 1/e-o(1)$ was apparently established in unpublished work of Erd\H{o}s, Selfridge, and Straus; but the proof is lost. Here we obtain the more precise asymptotic bounds $$ \frac{1}{e} - \frac{O(1)}{\log N} \leq \frac{t(N)}{N} \leq \frac{1}{e} - \frac{c_0+o(1)}{\log N}$$ for an explicit constant $c_0 \approx 0.3044$, answering a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham. Our methods are elementary, aside from the use of the prime number theorem (with classical error term). Using an effective version of the upper bound argument, we also show that $t(N)/N &lt; 1/e$ for $N \neq 1,2,4$, answering a question of Guy and Selfridge.</description>

      <title>Deformations and Lifts of Calabi-Yau Varieties in Characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ using techniques from derived algebraic geometry. We prove a mixed characteristic analogue of the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem (which states that Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $0$ are unobstructed), and we show that ordinary Calabi-Yau varieties admit canonical lifts to characteristic $0$, generalising the Serre-Tate theorem on ordinary abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>A remark on the Langlands correspondence for tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an algebraic torus defined over a local (or global) field $F$, a celebrated result of R.P. Langlands establishes a natural homomorphism from the group of continuous cohomology classes of the Weil group, valued in the dual torus, onto the space of complex characters of the rational points of the torus (or automorphic characters in the global case). We slightly extend this result by showing that, if we topologize the relevant spaces of continuous homomorphisms and continuous cochains with the compact-open topology, then Langlands's homomorphism is continuous and open. Moreover, we demonstrate that, in both the local and global settings, the subset of unramified characters corresponds to the identity component of the relevant space of characters when viewed in this topological framework. Finally, we compare the group of unramified characters and the Galois (co)invariants of the dual torus.</description>

      <title>Liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-representations and odd-th cyclic covers of genus one two-bridge knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and let $K$ be a genus one two-bridge knot. In the spirit of arithmetic topology, we observe that if $p$ divides the size of the 1st homology group of some odd-th cyclic branched cover of the knot $K$, then its group $\pi_1(S^3-K)$ admits a liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-character, where $\mathbb{Z}_p$ denotes the ring of $p$-adic integers. In addition, we discuss the existence of liminal ${\rm SL}_2\mathbb{Z}_p$-representations and give a remark on a general two-bridge knot. In the course of argument, we also point out a constraint for prime numbers dividing certain Lucas-type sequences by using the Legendre symbols.</description>

      <title>On lattice illumination of smooth convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The illumination conjecture is a classical open problem in convex and discrete geometry, asserting that every compact convex body~$K$ in $\mathbb R^n$ can be illuminated by a set of no more than $2^n$ points. If $K$ has smooth boundary, it is known that $n+1$ points are necessary and sufficient. We consider an effective variant of the illumination problem for bodies with smooth boundary, where the illuminating set is restricted to points of a lattice and prove the existence of such a set close to $K$ with an explicit bound on the maximal distance. We produce improved bounds on this distance for certain classes of lattices, exhibiting additional symmetry or near-orthogonality properties. Our approach is based on the geometry of numbers.</description>

      <title>On the records and zeros of a deterministic random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We settle two questions on sequence A120243 in the OEIS that were raised by Clark Kimberling and partly solve a conjecture of Van de Lune and Arias de Reyna. We extend Kimberling's questions to the framework of deterministic random walks, automatic sequences, and linear recurrences. Our results indicate that there may be a deeper connection between these structures. In particular, we conjecture that the records of deterministic random walks are $\xi$-Ostrowski automatic for a quadratic rotation number $\xi$.</description>

      <title>Decomposition results for multiplicative actions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>
