      <title>A Cost-effective Edge Computing Gateway for Smart Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The retrofitting of existing buildings with building management systems presents significant challenges, primarily due to the need for labor and cost efficiency. Wireless technology offers a promising solution to these challenges by minimizing the need for extensive wiring and structural alterations. However, achieving retrofitting in a cost-effective manner necessitates the use of low-cost wireless technologies. This paper introduces a framework for constructing a Zigbee gateway using open-source tools combined with low-cost hardware. The proposed architecture addresses large-scale IoT deployments within the Zigbee ecosystem. By leveraging edge computing with the robustness and scalability offered by Zigbee technology, this architecture significantly reduces the economic barriers to retrofit buildings with building management systems. The results underscore the potential of open-source Zigbee technology in aligning with sustainability goals, providing a cost-effective pathway for retrofitting buildings into smart, energy-efficient living environments.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Power Consumption under SINR Constraints for Cell-Free Massive MIMO in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of energy consumption minimization in Open RAN cell-free (CF) massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (mMIMO) systems under minimum per-user signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) constraints. Considering that several access points (APs) are deployed with multiple antennas, and they jointly serve multiple users on the same time-frequency resources, we design the precoding vectors that minimize the system power consumption, while preserving a minimum SINR for each user. We use a simple, yet representative, power consumption model, which consists of a fixed term that models the power consumption due to activation of the AP and a variable one that depends on the transmitted power. The mentioned problem boils down to a binary-constrained quadratic optimization problem, which is strongly non-convex. In order to solve this problem, we resort to a novel approach, which is based on the penalized convex-concave procedure. The proposed approach can be implemented in an O-RAN cell-free mMIMO system as an xApp in the near-real time RIC (RAN intelligent Controller). Numerical results show the potential of this approach for dealing with joint precoding optimization and AP selection.</description>

      <title>Fast Adaptation for Deep Learning-based Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration with artificial intelligence (AI) is recognized as one of the six usage scenarios in next-generation wireless communications. However, several critical challenges hinder the widespread application of deep learning (DL) techniques in wireless communications. In particular, existing DL-based wireless communications struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing wireless environments. In this paper, we discuss fast adaptation for DL-based wireless communications by using few-shot learning (FSL) techniques. We first identify the differences between fast adaptation in wireless communications and traditional AI tasks by highlighting two distinct FSL design requirements for wireless communications. To establish a wide perspective, we present a comprehensive review of the existing FSL techniques in wireless communications that satisfy these two design requirements. In particular, we emphasize the importance of applying domain knowledge in achieving fast adaptation. We specifically focus on multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) precoding as an examples to demonstrate the advantages of the FSL to achieve fast adaptation in wireless communications. Finally, we highlight several open research issues for achieving broadscope future deployment of fast adaptive DL in wireless communication applications.</description>

      <title>Security Implications and Mitigation Strategies in MPLS Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a high-performance telecommunications technology that directs data from one network node to another based on short path labels rather than long network addresses. Its efficiency and scalability have made it a popular choice for large-scale and enterprise networks. However, as MPLS networks grow and evolve, they encounter various security challenges. This paper explores the security implications associated with MPLS networks, including risks such as label spoofing, traffic interception, and denial of service attacks. Additionally, it evaluates advanced mitigation strategies to address these vulnerabilities, leveraging mathematical models and security protocols to enhance MPLS network resilience. By integrating theoretical analysis with practical solutions, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of MPLS security and propose effective methods for safeguarding network infrastructure.</description>
