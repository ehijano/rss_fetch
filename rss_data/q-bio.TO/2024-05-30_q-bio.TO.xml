Abstract: Low-frequency oscillations in the human circulatory system is important for basic physiology and practical applications in clinical medicine. Our objective was to study which mechanism (central or local) is responsible for changes in blood flow fluctuations at around 0.1 Hz. We used the method of imaging photoplethysmography synchronized with electrocardiography to measure blood-flow response to local forearm heating of 18 healthy male volunteers. The dynamics of peripheral perfusion was revealed by a correlation processing of photoplethysmography data, and the central hemodynamics was assessed from the electrocardiogram. Wavelet analysis was used to estimate the dynamics of spectral components. Our results show that skin heating leads to multiple increase in local perfusion accompanied by drop in blood flow oscillations at 0.1 Hz, whereas no changes in heart rate variability was observed. After switching off the heating, perfusion remains at the high level, regardless decrease in skin temperature. The 0.1 Hz oscillations are smoothly recovered to the base level. In conclusion, we confirm the local nature of fluctuations in peripheral blood flow in the frequency band of about 0.1 Hz. A significant, but time-delayed, recovery of fluctuation energy in this frequency range after cessation of the skin warming was discovered. This study reveals a novel factor involved in the regulation microcirculatory vascular tone. A comprehensive study of hemodynamics using the new technique of imaging photoplethysmography synchronized with electrocardiography is a prerequisite for development of a valuable diagnostic tool.</description>
