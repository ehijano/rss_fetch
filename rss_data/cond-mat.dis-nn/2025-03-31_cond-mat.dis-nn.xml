      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>

      <title>Deep Nets as Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new machine learning input data type, "spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised machine learning on two models, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. These results validate the spin-opstring as an effective input for machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations of Local Topological Order Parameters in Disordered Two-dimensional Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and conductive edge states protected by the nontrivial topology of the bulk electronic structure. They remain robust against moderate disorder until Anderson localization occurs and destroys the topological phase. Interestingly, disorder can also induce a topological phase - known as a topological Anderson insulator - starting from an otherwise pristine trivial phase. While topological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue that space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters, revealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under Anderson disorder and vacancies. With this perspective, we perform numerical simulations of disorder-driven topological phase transitions in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models, using supercells with both open and periodic boundary conditions. We find that short-scale fluctuations of topological markers vanish upon coarse-graining, except at the topological phase transition, where their correlation length peaks and large-scale fluctuations remain.</description>

      <title>Amplitude mode at the superfluid-insulator transition on a random lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the superfluid-insulator quantum phase transition of interacting bosons by means of large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in the presence of both topological and generic quenched disorders. Recent work has demonstrated that the amplitude mode at this transition broadens and localizes in the presence of dilution disorder, whereas it remains a well-defined delocalized excitation for topological (connectivity) disorder. Here, we analyze the crossover between systems with purely topological disorder and systems with additional bond randomness to disentangle the roles that disorder and interactions play for amplitude mode localization. Specifically, we analyze the scalar susceptibility and its spectral density on both sides of the quantum phase transition. We also discuss the implications of our results for the potential observation of amplitude mode localization in experiments.</description>

      <title>Feature learning from non-Gaussian inputs: the case of Independent Component Analysis in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks learn structured features from complex, non-Gaussian inputs, but the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. Our work is motivated by the observation that the first-layer filters learnt by deep convolutional neural networks from natural images resemble those learnt by independent component analysis (ICA), a simple unsupervised method that seeks the most non-Gaussian projections of its inputs. This similarity suggests that ICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning. Here, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data structure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA algorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to train deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least $n\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from $d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla online SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n \gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent way. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on ImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates for the poor sample complexity of FastICA.</description>

      <title>Efficient Construction of Feasible Solutions in Column Generation using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG, can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible 0-1 solutions. This study proposes a post-processing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the proposed post-processing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with significantly reduced computation time.</description>

      <title>Mean field model of contagion processes in urban traffic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the emergence of macroscopic epidemic type behavior, in the form of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes in urban traffic congestion from microscopic network flows is given. Moreover, it's shown that the emergence of SIS/SIR implies a relationship between traffic flow and density, which is consistent with observations of the so called Fundamental Diagram of Traffic, which is a characteristic signature of vehicle movement phenomena that spans multiple scales. Our results provide a plausible explanation for this scale-spanning signature and put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition and Geometrical Frustration in Fourier Photonic Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group analysis reveals universality classes of stochastic spiking neuron networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuits may operate close to ``critical points'' -- boundaries between different phases of collective activity. This has been argued to have functional benefits for neural computation. Studies investigating whether neural circuits are poised near critical points have largely relied on establishing power laws in neural data, while a fundamental understanding of critical phenomena requires a renormalization group (RG) analysis. However, neural activity is typically non-Gaussian, nonlinear, and non-local, rendering models that capture all of these features difficult to study using standard statistical physics techniques. We overcome these issues and adapt the non-perturbative renormalization group (NPRG) to provide the first RG analysis of networks of stochastic spiking neurons. We show that neural populations can belong to at least two important universality classes: 1) in networks with an absorbing state there is a transition between sustained and extinguished activity that belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and 2) in spontaneously active networks there is a continuous transition between high and low firing rate states that belongs to the Ising model universality class. We verify our theoretical results by simulating the network model on lattices in $2$ and $3$ dimensions, recovering known exponents, and then investigate critical phenomena in networks of sparsely-connected excitatory neurons and densely-connected inhibitory neurons. Depending on the amount of inhibitory feedback, these networks may display mean-field exponents or anomalous exponents close to -- but potentially not equal to -- lattices of the same effective dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. To address this limitation, we introduce a theoretical framework that leverages latent directions in input space, which can be related to contextual information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent manifold capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation reformatting in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning prediction workflow to study the impact of defects on the Raman response of 2D materials. By combining the use of machine-learned interatomic potentials, the Raman-active $\Gamma$-weighted density of states method and splitting configurations in independant patches, we are able to reach simulation sizes in the tens of thousands of atoms, with diagonalization now being the main bottleneck of the simulation. We apply the method to two systems, isotopic graphene and defective hexagonal boron nitride, and compare our predicted Raman response to experimental results, with good agreement. Our method opens up many possibilities for future studies of Raman response in solid-state physics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Energy-Sensitive Universal Conductance Fluctuations in Anisotropic Materials</title>

Abstract: Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) are a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18969</link>

Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Entanglement Phase Transition in Free Fermion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIET) highlight how local measurements drive quantum systems between area-law and volume-law entangled states. This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of MIET in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.</description>
