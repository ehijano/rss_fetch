      <title>The atmosphere of HD 149026b: Low metal-enrichment and weak energy transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST eclipse spectra of the high-density hot Saturn HD 149026b between 2.35 and 5.08 $\mu$m has allowed for in-depth study of its atmosphere. To understand its atmospheric properties, we have created a grid of 1D radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium atmosphere models and spectra with PICASO 3.0. In agreement with previous work, we find that the presence of gaseous TiO creates a thermal inversion, which is inconsistent with the data. The presence of gaseous VO, however, which condenses at temperatures 200 K cooler, does not cause such inversions but alters the temperature-pressure profile of the atmosphere. We estimate an atmospheric metallicity of $14^{+12}_{-8}\times$ solar without VO and $20^{+11}_{-8}\times$ solar with VO, a factor of $\sim 10$ times smaller than previous work from Bean et al. (2023), who relied on atmosphere retrievals. We attribute this significant difference in metallicity to a larger temperature gradient at low pressures in radiative equilibrium models. Such models with lower metallicities readily fit the strong CO$_2$ feature at 4.3 $\mu$m. Our lower estimated metallicity makes HD 149026b more consistent with the mass-metallicity relationship for other giant planets. We find a C/O ratio of $0.67^{+0.06}_{-0.27}$ with and without VO. The best-fit heat redistribution factor without VO is $1.17$, a very high value suggesting very little dayside energy transport and no energy transport to the night side. The heat redistribution factor shrinks to a more plausible value of $0.91^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, with VO, which we regard as circumstantial evidence for the molecule in the atmosphere of HD 149026b.</description>

      <title>A broken debris cascade as a possible source of hot dust emission in transitioning planet-forming disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet-forming disks turn from gas-rich, massive disks made of dust and gas into planetary systems containing only small amounts dust produced by collisions between smaller planetary objects like planetesimals, asteroids, or comets. Traditionally we talk about protoplanetary (age $\sim$1 Myr), transitional ($\sim$ 5-10 Myr), and debris disks ($\sim$ 10-hundreds of Myr), even though the overlap between these phases may be relevant. We aim to show that in the transition phase of a disk, when gas surface densities are reduced but not yet negligible, a seemingly small amount of collisional activity may lead to the production of dust on a level that is observationally relevant by creating regions of optical depth 1 or above. In particular, we aim to show that the hot dust emission component of transitional disks may in fact be debris dust produced in such collisions. We develop an analytical model to derive the conditions under which observationally relevant amounts of dust can be produced. We focus on the effect of the gas surface density during the transition phase of a disk from fully gas-dominated to the gas-poor debris stage. We show that the decrease of the gas surface density has an important effect. It allows smaller planetesimals to become collisional, starting a cascade. At the same time, small particles are not destroyed by collisions. That interrupted cascade is critical to preserve the produced dust for significant time intervals, allowing a seemingly minor amount of planetesimal collisions to be effective in producing detectable amounts of dust. The warm emission of low amounts of dust in many transitional planet-forming disks might be caused entirely by second-generation dust, exposing planetary material at a time much earlier than the age of what are traditionally considered as debris disks.</description>

      <title>The impact of Ozone on Earth-like exoplanet climate dynamics: the case of Proxima Centauri b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the James Webb Space Telescope and the development of other advanced observatories (e.g., ELTs, LIFE and HWO) marks a pivotal moment in the quest to characterize the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets. Motivated by these advancements, we conduct theoretical explorations of exoplanetary atmospheres, focusing on refining our understanding of planetary climate and habitability. Our study investigates the impact of ozone on the atmosphere of Proxima Centauri b in a synchronous orbit, utilizing coupled climate chemistry model simulations and dynamical systems theory. The latter quantifies compound dynamical metrics in phase space through the inverse of co-persistence ($\theta$) and co-dimension (d), of which low values correspond to stable atmospheric states. Initially, we scrutinized the influence of ozone on temperature and wind speed. Including interactive ozone (i.e., coupled atmospheric (photo)chemistry) reduces the hemispheric difference in temperature from 68 K to 64 K, increases ($\sim+$7 K) atmospheric temperature at an altitude range of $\sim$20-50 km, and increases variability in the compound dynamics of temperature and wind speed. Moreover, with interactive ozone, wind speed during highly temporally stable states is weaker than for unstable ones, and ozone transport to the nightside gyres during unstable states is enhanced compared to stable ones ($\sim+$800 DU). We conclude that including interactive ozone significantly influences Earth-like exoplanets' chemistry and climate dynamics. This study establishes a novel pathway for comprehending the influence of photochemical species on the climate dynamics of potentially habitable Earth-like exoplanets. We envisage an extension of this framework to other exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Limited Role of the Streaming Instability During Moon and Exomoon Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that the Moon accreted from the disk formed by an impact between the proto-Earth and impactor, but its details are highly debated. Some models suggest that a Mars-sized impactor formed a silicate melt-rich (vapor-poor) disk around Earth, whereas other models suggest that a highly energetic impact produced a silicate vapor-rich disk. Such a vapor-rich disk, however, may not be suitable for the Moon formation, because moonlets, building blocks of the Moon, of 100 m-100 km may experience strong gas drag and fall onto Earth on a short timescale, failing to grow further. This problem may be avoided if large moonlets ($\gg 100$ km) form very quickly by streaming instability, which is a process to concentrate particles enough to cause gravitational collapse and rapid formation of planetesimals or moonlets. Here, we investigate the effect of the streaming instability in the Moon-forming disk for the first time and find that this instability can quickly form $\sim 100$ km-sized moonlets. However, these moonlets are not large enough to avoid strong drag and they still fall onto Earth quickly. This suggests that the vapor-rich disks may not form the large Moon, and therefore the models that produce vapor-poor disks are supported. This result is applicable to general impact-induced moon-forming disks, supporting the previous suggestion that small planets ($&lt;1.6 R_\oplus$) are good candidates to host large moons because their impact-induced disks would be likely vapor-poor. We find a limited role of streaming instability in a satellite formation in an impact-induced disk, whereas it plays a key role during planet formation.</description>

      <title>The population of small near-Earth objects: composition, source regions and rotational properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of small ($&lt;$300 m) near-Earth objects (NEOs) is important because they are more closely related than larger objects to the precursors of meteorites that fall on Earth. Collisions of these bodies with Earth are also more frequent. Although such collisions cannot produce massive extinction events, they can still produce significant local damage. Here we present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic survey of small NEOs, which include near-infrared (NIR) spectra of 84 objects with a mean diameter of 126 m and photometric data of 59 objects with a mean diameter of 87 m. We found that S-complex asteroids are the most abundant among the NEOs, comprising $\sim$66\% of the sample. Most asteroids in the S-complex were found to have compositions consistent with LL-chondrites. Our study revealed the existence of NEOs with spectral characteristics similar to those in the S-complex, but that could be hidden within the C- or X-complex due to their weak absorption bands. We suggest that the presence of metal or shock-darkening could be responsible for the attenuation of the absorption bands. These objects have been grouped into a new subclass within the S-complex called Sx-types. The dynamical modeling showed that 83\% of the NEOs escaped from the $\nu_{6}$ resonance, 16\% from the 3:1 and just 1\% from the 5:2 resonance. Lightcurves and rotational periods were derived from the photometric data. No clear trend between the axis ratio and the absolute magnitude or rotational period of the NEOs was found.</description>

      <title>Photo-dynamical Analysis of Circumbinary Multi-planet system TOI-1338: a Fully Coplanar Configuration with a Puffy Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-1338 is the first circumbinary planet system discovered by TESS. It has one transiting planet at P$\sim$95 day and an outer non-transiting planet at P$\sim$215 day complemented by RV observation. Here we present a global photo-dynamical modeling of the TOI-1338 system that self-consistently accounts for the mutual gravitational interactions between all known bodies in the system. As a result, the three-dimensional architecture of the system can be established by comparing the model with additional data from TESS Extended Mission and published HARPS/ESPRESSO radial velocity data. We report an inconsistency of binary RV signal between HARPS and ESPRESSO, which could be due to the contamination of the secondary star. According to stability analysis, the RV data via ESPRESSO is preferred. Our results are summarized as follows: (1) the inner transiting planet is extremely coplanar to the binary plane $\Delta I_b \sim 0.12 ^\circ$, making it a permanently transiting circumbinary planet at any nodal precession phases. We updated the future transit ephemerides with improved precisions. (2) The outer planet, despite its non-transiting nature, is also coplanar with the binary plane by $\Delta I_c=9.1^{+6.0 \circ}_{-4.8}$ (22$^\circ$ for 99\% upper limit). (3) The inner planet could have a density of $0.137 \pm 0.026$ g/cm$^{-3}$. With a TESS magnitude of 11.45, TOI-1338 b is an optimal circumbinary planet for ground-based follow-up and transit spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Detection of Fe and Ti on the dayside of the ultrahot Jupiter MASCARA-1b with CARMENES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahot Jupiters are a type of gaseous exoplanet that orbit extremely close to their host star, resulting in significantly high equilibrium temperatures. In recent years, high-resolution emission spectroscopy has been broadly employed in observing the atmospheres of ultrahot Jupiters. We used the CARMENES spectrograph to observe the high-resolution spectra of the dayside hemisphere of MASCARA-1b in both visible and near-infrared. Through cross-correlation analysis, we detected signals of \ion{Fe}{i} and \ion{Ti}{i}. Based on these detections, we conducted an atmospheric retrieval and discovered the presence of a strong inversion layer in the planet's atmosphere. The retrieved Ti and Fe abundances are broadly consistent with solar abundances. In particular, we obtained a relative abundance of [Ti/Fe] as $-1.0 \pm 0.8$ under the free retrieval and $-0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.8}$ under the chemical equilibrium retrieval, suggesting the absence of significant titanium depletion on this planet. Furthermore, we considered the influence of planetary rotation on spectral line profiles. The resulting equatorial rotation speed was determined to be $4.4^{+1.6}_{-2.0}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which agrees with the rotation speed induced by tidal locking.</description>

      <title>NEOMOD 3: The Debiased Size Distribution of Near Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our previous model (NEOMOD2) for the orbital and absolute magnitude distribution of Near Earth Objects (NEOs) was calibrated on the Catalina Sky Survey observations between 2013 and 2022. Here we extend NEOMOD2 to include visible albedo information from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer. The debiased albedo distribution of NEOs can be approximated by the sum of two Rayleigh distributions with the scale parameters p_V,dark=0.03 and p_V,bright=0.17. We find evidence for smaller NEOs having (on average) higher albedos than larger NEOs; this is likely a consequence of the size-dependent sampling of different main belt sources. These inferences and the absolute magnitude distribution from NEOMOD2 are used to construct the debiased size distribution of NEOs. We estimate 830+/-60 NEOs with diameters D&gt;1 km and 20,000+/-2,000 NEOs with D&gt;140 m. The new model, NEOMOD3, is available via the NEOMOD Simulator -- an easy-to-operate code that can be used to generate user-defined samples (orbits, sizes and albedos) from the model.</description>

      <title>Searching for planet-driven dust spirals in ALMA visibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA (Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array) observations of the thermal emission from protoplanetary disc dust have revealed a wealth of substructures that could evidence embedded planets, but planet-driven spirals, one of the more compelling lines of evidence, remain relatively rare. Existing works have focused on detecting these spirals using methods that operate in image space. Here, we explore the planet detection capabilities of fitting planet-driven spirals to disc observations directly in visibility space. We test our method on synthetic ALMA observations of planet-containing model discs for a range of disc/observational parameters, finding it significantly outperforms image residuals in identifying spirals in these observations and is able to identify spirals in regions of the parameter space in which no gaps are detected. These tests suggest that a visibility-space fitting approach warrants further investigation and may be able to find planet-driven spirals in observations that have not yet been found with existing approaches. We also test our method on six discs in the Taurus molecular cloud observed with ALMA at 1.33 mm, but find no evidence for planet-driven spirals. We find that the minimum planet masses necessary to drive detectable spirals range from $\approx$ 0.03 to 0.5 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ over orbital radii of 10 to 100 au, with planet masses below these thresholds potentially hiding in such disc observations. Conversely, we suggest that planets $\gtrsim$ 0.5 to 1 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ can likely be ruled out over orbital radii of $\approx$ 20 to 60 au on the grounds that we would have detected them if they were present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the standard algorithm for converting spacecraft state vectors to Keplerian orbital elements with a focus on its computer implementation. It analyzes the shortcomings of the scheme as described in the literature, and proposes changes to address orbits of arbitrary eccentricity and inclination in a robust way. Next, it presents two alternative schemes that simplify the program structure while improving the accuracy and speed of the transformation on modern computer architectures. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks demonstrate accuracy improvements by two orders of magnitude, together with a 40% reduction of computational cost relative to the standard implementation.</description>

      <title>Potential Paradigm Shift in Hazard Risk Management: AI-Based Weather Forecast for Tropical Cyclone Hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advents of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven models marks a paradigm shift in risk management strategies for meteorological hazards. This study specifically employs tropical cyclones (TCs) as a focal example. We engineer a perturbation-based method to produce ensemble forecasts using the advanced Pangu AI weather model. Unlike traditional approaches that often generate fewer than 20 scenarios from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations for one event, our method facilitates the rapid nature of AI-driven model to create thousands of scenarios. We offer open-source access to our model and evaluate its effectiveness through retrospective case studies of significant TC events: Hurricane Irma (2017), Typhoon Mangkhut (2018), and TC Debbie (2017), affecting regions across North America, East Asia, and Australia. Our findings indicate that the AI-generated ensemble forecasts align closely with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble predictions up to seven days prior to landfall. This approach could substantially enhance the effectiveness of weather forecast-driven risk analysis and management, providing unprecedented operational speed, user-friendliness, and global applicability.</description>

      <title>A simple model for the emergence of relaxation-oscillator convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth's tropics are characterized by quasi-steady precipitation with small oscillations about a mean value, which has led to the hypothesis that moist convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium (QE). In contrast, very warm simulations of Earth's tropical convection are characterized by relaxation-oscillator-like (RO) precipitation, with short-lived convective storms and torrential rainfall forming and dissipating at regular intervals with little to no precipitation in between. We develop a model of moist convection by combining a zero-buoyancy model of bulk-plume convection with a QE heat engine model, and we use it to show that QE is violated at high surface temperatures. We hypothesize that the RO state emerges when the equilibrium condition of the convective heat engine is violated, i.e., when the net cooling times a thermodynamic efficiency exceeds the work that can be performed. We test our hypothesis against one- and three-dimensional numerical simulations and find that it accurately predicts the onset of RO convection. The proposed mechanism for RO emergence from QE breakdown is agnostic of the condensing component, and can be applied to any planetary atmosphere undergoing moist convection. To date, RO states have only been demonstrated in three-dimensional convection-resolving simulations, which has made it seem that the physics of the RO state requires simulations that can explicitly resolve the three-dimensional interaction of cloudy plumes and their environment. We demonstrate that RO states also exist in single-column simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with parameterized convection, albeit in a different surface temperature range and with much longer storm-free intervals.</description>

      <title>Strong fractionation of deuterium and helium in sub-Neptune atmospheres along the radius valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate atmospheric fractionation in escaping planetary atmospheres using IsoFATE, a new open-source numerical model. We expand the parameter space studied previously to planets with tenuous atmospheres that exhibit the greatest helium and deuterium enhancement. We simulate the effects of EUV-driven photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss on deuterium-hydrogen and helium-hydrogen fractionation of sub-Neptune atmospheres around G, K, and M stars. Our simulations predict prominent populations of deuterium- and helium-enhanced planets along the upper edge of the radius valley with mean equilibrium temperatures of 370 K and as low as 150 K across stellar types. We find that fractionation is mechanism-dependent, so constraining He/H and D/H abundances in sub-Neptune atmospheres offers a unique strategy to investigate the origin of the radius valley around low-mass stars. Fractionation is also strongly dependent on retained atmospheric mass, offering a proxy for planetary surface pressure as well as a way to distinguish between desiccated enveloped terrestrials and water worlds. Deuterium-enhanced planets tend to be helium-dominated and CH4-depleted, providing a promising strategy to observe HDO in the 3.7 um window. We present a list of promising targets for observational follow-up.</description>

Abstract: In the past decade, ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks revealed various substructures including gaps and rings. Their origin may be probed through statistical studies on the physical properties of the substructures. We present the analyses of archival ALMA Band 6 continuum data of 43 disks (39 Class II and 4 Herbig Ae) in the Taurus-Auriga region. We employ a novel 2D super-resolution imaging technique based on sparse modeling to obtain images with high fidelity and spatial resolution. As a result, we have obtained images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au ($0''.02 - 0''.1$), which is two to three times better than conventional CLEAN methods. All dust disks are spatially resolved, with the radii ranging from 8 to 238 au with a median radius of 45 au. Half of the disks harbor clear gap structures, whose radial locations show a bimodal distribution with peaks at $\lesssim20$ au and $\gtrsim30$ au. We also see structures indicating weak gaps at all the radii in the disk. We find that the widths of these gaps increase with their depths, which is consistent with the model of planet-disk interactions. The inferred planet mass-orbital radius distribution indicates that the planet distribution is analogous to our Solar System. However, planets with Neptune mass or lower may exist in all the radii.</description>
