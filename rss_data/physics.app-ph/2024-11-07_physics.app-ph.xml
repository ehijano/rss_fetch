      <title>Quasi-electrostatic eigenmode analysis of anisotropic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties that arise from the directional and multispectral nature of anisotropic materials, leading to numerous potential applications in photonics, biomedicine, and magnetism. Furthermore, anisotropic particles are ubiquitous in naturally occurring and existing systems such as ice and dust grains, liquid crystal droplets, and ferromagnetic particles, and they correspond to atoms in magnetic fields and anisotropic molecules. However, despite considerable effort, the complexity that they introduce to the theory has significantly limited their eigenmode analysis, hindering their understanding and broad applicability. Here we analytically derive the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of anisotropic spheres and ellipsoids. We show that anisotropic particles exhibit novel radiation patterns. In addition, we identify axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting in uniaxial and biaxial particles and eigenvalue degeneracy in uniaxial spheres. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers in unexplored spectral regions and apply to additional fields of physics such as magnetism, heat conduction, and atomic and molecular physics.</description>

      <title>Self-Healing in Dielectric Capacitors: a Universal Method to Computationally Rate Newly Introduced Energy Storage Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-film dielectric capacitors provide lump portions of energy on demand. While the capacities of various capacitor designs are comparable in magnitude, their stabilities make a difference. Dielectric breakdowns - micro-discharges - routinely occur in capacitors due to the inevitable presence of localized structure defects. The application of polymeric dielectric materials featuring flexible structures helps obtain more uniform insulating layers. At the modern technological level, it is impossible to completely avoid micro-discharges upon device exploitation. Every micro-discharge results in the formation of a soot channel, which is empirically known to exhibit semiconductor behavior. Because of its capability to conduct electricity, the emerged soot channels harm the subsequent capacitor performance and decrease the amount of stored energy. The accumulation of the soot throughout a dielectric capacitor ultimately results in irreversible overall failure. In the context of the dielectric breakdown, self-healing designates a range of chemical processes, which spontaneously rearrange the atoms in the soot channels to partially return their insulative function. We developed a universal method capable of rating new capacitor designs including electrode and polymer material and their proportions. We found the best-performing designs produce abundant volatile by-products after micro-discharge, whereas the soot samples exhibit lower electronic conductivities. We proved the capability of the theoretical method to rate the empirical performance of the known capacitors. The method relies on various electronic-structure simulations and potential landscape explorations. The reported advance opens an impressive avenue to computationally probe thousands of hypothetical capacitor designs.</description>

      <title>Rotating, cylindrical, acoustic invisibility cloak: solution using perturbation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformation Acoustics emerged in the mid-2000s, initiating a new paradigm of metamaterial designs. One of the most compelling designs, the invisibility cloak, holds promise for stealth and noise reduction applications in aviation. However, adapting this design to meet the demands of realistic conditions has proven challenging. This work focusses on the design of a stationary 2D cylindrical cloak and its performance whilst rotating, a result not yet reported in the literature. The study utilises linearised equations of motion with convective terms. A wave equation is derived, and corresponding solution and scattering coefficient are derived using a perturbation method and exact numerical solution. These results are used to evaluate the performance of the rotating cloak. Results show that rotation causes a reduction in cloaking performance with greater scattering observed for increasing rotational speeds, with a reasonable agreement (within 5%) between methods over the range of applicability. The perturbation method offers a fast, computationally inexpensive means of evaluating a rotating, graded anisotropic fluid.</description>

      <title>Ultralow loss torsion micropendula for chipscale gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pendulum is one of the oldest gravimeters, featuring frequency-based readout limited by geometric nonlinearity. While modern gravimeters focus on displacement-based spring-mass or free-fall designs, the advent of nanofabrication techniques invites a revisiting of the pendulum, motivated by the prospect of low-loss, compact, isochronous operation, leveraging precise dimensional control. Here we exploit advances in strain-engineered nanomechanics -- specifically, strained Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbon suspensions -- to realize a $0.1$ mg, $32$ Hz torsion pendulum with an ultralow damping rate of $16\,\mu$Hz and a parametric gravity sensitivity of $5$ Hz/$g_0$ ($g_0 = 9.8\;\text{m}/\text{s}^2)$. The low thermal acceleration of the pendulum, $2\times 10^{-9}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, gives access to a parametric gravity resolution of $10^{-8}g_0$ for drive amplitudes of $10\;\text{mrad}$ and integration times within the free decay time, of interest for both commercial applications and fundamental experiments. We present progress toward this goal, demonstrating free and self-sustained oscillators with frequency stabilities as little as $2.5\,\mu$Hz at 200 s, corresponding to a gravity resolution of $5\times 10^{-7}g_0$. We also show how the Duffing nonlinearity of the suspension can be used to cancel the pendulum nonlinearity, paving the way toward a fully isochronous, high-$Q$ micromechanical clock.</description>

      <title>A Printed Microscopic Universal Gradient Interface for Super Stretchable Strain-Insensitive Bioelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on-skin devices for high-fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain-induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here we report all-printed super stretchable strain-insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol-based multi-materials printing technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain-insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% stretch ratio. We demonstrate various stretchable devices directly printed on the UGI for on-skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor-based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal-based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real-time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Unified Approach to Power-Efficiency Trade-Off of Generic Thermal Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the diverse functionalities of different thermal machines, their optimization relies on a case-by-case basis, lacking unified results. In this work, we propose a general approach to determine power-efficiency trade-off relation (PETOR) for any thermal machine. For cases where cycle (of duration $\tau$) irreversibility satisfies the typical $1/\tau$-scaling, we provide a unified PETOR which is applicable to heat engines, refrigerators, heat exchangers and heat pumps. It is shown that, some typical PETORs, such as those for low-dissipation Carnot cycles (including heat engine and refrigerator cycles) and the steady-state heat engines operating between finite-sized reservoirs are naturally recovered.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast spin Hall nano-oscillator based microwave spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-fast spectrum analysis concept based on rapidly tuned spintronic nano-oscillators has been under development for the last few years and has already demonstrated promising results. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-fast microwave spectrum analyzer based on a chain of five mutually synchronized nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). As mutual synchronization affords the chain a much improved signal quality, with linewidths well below 1 MHz at close to a 10 GHz operating frequency, we observe an order of magnitude better frequency resolution bandwidth compared to previously reported spectral analysis based on single magnetic tunnel junction based spin torque nano-oscillators. The high-frequency operation and ability to synchronize long SHNO chains and large arrays make SHNOs ideal candidates for ultra-fast microwave spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>The Andreev-Ising-Josephson Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition-metal dichalcogenides featuring Ising spin-orbit coupling in so-called Ising superconductors offer a unique system to study the interplay of singlet and triplet superconductivity. The presence of high critical fields, spectral properties such as the mirage gap, and field-tunable charge and spin currents in Ising-superconductor Josephson junctions are some of the important features. In this work, we study Ising-superconductor Josephson junction with a transparent interface and show that Andreev bound states are spin-split due to a relative misorientation of in-plane fields in the superconducting contacts. Correspondingly, supercurrent-phase relations display a strongly non-sinusoidal behavior. Introducing additional spin-polarized channels with low transmission results in a nonreciprocal current-phase relation with a diode effect that can be tuned by the in-plane exchange fields. The diode efficiency reaches high values of the order of 40% and is not sensitive to disorder in the junction. Such structures can be realized in van-der-Waals heterostructures of two dimensional superconductors and magnets.</description>

      <title>On the application of components manufactured with stereolithographic 3D printing in high vacuum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) compatibility of Formlabs `Clear Resin' via vat photopolymerization (VPP). We report on a method for using VPP additive manufacturing, specifically Formlabs' widely available stereolithographic (SLA) printing using their `Clear Resin' material, to rapidly and cheaply prototype components for use in high-vacuum (HV) environments. We present pump down curves and residual gas analysis to demonstrate the primary vacuum contaminant from freshly printed SLA plastics is water with no evidence of polymers outgassing from the material and thus the vacuum performance can be controlled with simple treatments which do not involve surface sealing. An unbaked vacuum system containing SLA printed components achieved 1.9e-8 mbar base pressure whilst retaining structural integrity and manufacturing accuracy. Outgassing rates in the HV test chamber and preliminary results in a UHV chamber indicate that our method can be extended to achieve ultrahigh-vacuum compatibility. We further report on the effect of atmospheric exposure to components and present evidence to suggest that water re-ad/absorption occurs exclusively on the surface, by showing that the bulk mass changes of the material is irreversible on the timescale investigated (&lt; 2 weeks).</description>

      <title>Global calibration of large-scale photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing maturity of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) fabrication technology enables the high integration of an increasing number of optical components onto a single chip. With the incremental circuit complexity, the calibration of active phase shifters in a large-scale PIC becomes a crucially important issue. The traditional one-by-one calibration techniques encounter significant hurdles with the propagation of calibration errors, and achieving the decoupling of all phase shifters for independent calibration is not straightforward. To address this issue, we propose a global calibration approach for large-scale PIC. Our method utilizes a custom network to simultaneously learn the nonlinear phase-current relations for all thermo-optic phase shifters on the PIC by minimizing the negative likelihood of the measurement datasets. Moreover, the reflectivities of all static beam splitter components can also be synchronizedly extracted using this calibration method. As an example, a quantum walk PIC with a circuit depth of 12 is calibrated, and a programmable discrete-time quantum walk is experimentally demonstrated. These results will greatly benefit the applications of large-scale PICs in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of phase information from low-dose electron microscopy experiments: are we at the limit yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of imaging low-density objects in an electron microscope without causing beam damage is significant in modern TEM. This is especially true for life science imaging, where the sample, rather than the instrument, still determines the resolution limit. Here, we explore whether we have to accept this or can progress further in this area. To do this, we use numerical simulations to see how much information we can obtain from a weak phase object at different electron doses. Starting from a model with four phase values, we compare Zernike phase contrast with measuring diffracted intensity under multiple random phase illuminations to solve the inverse problem. Our simulations have shown that diffraction-based methods perform better than the Zernike method, as we have found and addressed a normalization issue that, in some other studies, led to an overly optimistic representation of the Zernike setup. We further validated this using more realistic 2D objects and found that random phase illuminated diffraction can be up to five times more efficient than an ideal Zernike implementation. These findings suggest that diffraction-based methods could be a promising approach for imaging beam-sensitive materials and that current low-dose imaging methods are not yet at the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Kubo and Keldysh Approaches to Fermi-Sea-Dependent Nonequilibrium Observables: Application to Spin Hall Current and Spin-Orbit Torque in Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport studies of spin-dependent phenomena in solids commonly employ the Kubo or Keldysh formulas for the nonequilibrium density operator in the steady-state linear-response regime. Its trace with operators of interest, such as the spin density, spin current density, etc., gives expectation values of experimentally accessible observables. For local quantities, these formulas require summing over the manifolds of {\em both} Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea states. However, debates have been raging in the literature about the vastly different physics the two formulations can apparently produce, even when applied to the same system. Here, we revisit this problem using infinite-size graphene with proximity-induced spin-orbit and magnetic exchange effects as a testbed. By splitting this system into semi-infinite leads and central active region, in the spirit of Landauer formulation of quantum transport, we prove the {\em numerically exact equivalence} of the Kubo and Keldysh approaches via the computation of spin Hall current density and spin-orbit torque in both clean and disordered limits. The key to reconciling the two approaches are the numerical frameworks we develop for: ({\em i}) evaluation of Kubo(-Bastin) formula for a system attached to semi-infinite leads, which ensures continuous energy spectrum and evades the need for commonly used phenomenological broadening introducing ambiguity; and ({\em ii}) proper evaluation of Fermi-sea term in the Keldysh approach, which {\em must} include the voltage drop across the central active region even if it is disorder free.</description>
