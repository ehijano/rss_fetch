      <title>ForTune: Running Offline Scenarios to Estimate Impact on Business Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making ideal decisions as a product leader in a web-facing company is extremely difficult. In addition to navigating the ambiguity of customer satisfaction and achieving business goals, one must also pave a path forward for ones' products and services to remain relevant, desirable, and profitable. Data and experimentation to test product hypotheses are key to informing product decisions. Online controlled experiments by A/B testing may provide the best data to support such decisions with high confidence, but can be time-consuming and expensive, especially when one wants to understand impact to key business metrics such as retention or long-term value. Offline experimentation allows one to rapidly iterate and test, but often cannot provide the same level of confidence, and cannot easily shine a light on impact on business metrics. We introduce a novel, lightweight, and flexible approach to investigating hypotheses, called scenario analysis, that aims to support product leaders' decisions using data about users and estimates of business metrics. Its strengths are that it can provide guidance on trade-offs that are incurred by growing or shifting consumption, estimate trends in long-term outcomes like retention and other important business metrics, and can generate hypotheses about relationships between metrics at scale.</description>

      <title>Transforming Design Spaces Using Pareto-Laplace Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization is a critical tool for addressing a broad range of human and technical problems. However, the paradox of advanced optimization techniques is that they have maximum utility for problems in which the relationship between the structure of the problem and the ultimate solution is the most obscure. The existence of solution with limited insight contrasts with techniques that have been developed for a broad range of engineering problems where integral transform techniques yield solutions and insight in tandem. Here, we present a ``Pareto-Laplace'' integral transform framework that can be applied to problems typically studied via optimization. We show that the framework admits related geometric, statistical, and physical representations that provide new forms of insight into relationships between objectives and outcomes. We argue that some known approaches are special cases of this framework, and point to a broad range of problems for further application.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Activated Sludge Settling Characteristics from Microscopy Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microbial communities play a key role in biological wastewater treatment processes. Activated sludge settling characteristics, for example, are affected by microbial community composition, varying by changes in operating conditions and influent characteristics of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Timely assessment and prediction of changes in microbial composition leading to settling problems, such as filamentous bulking (FB), can prevent operational challenges, reductions in treatment efficiency, and adverse environmental impacts. This study presents an innovative computer vision-based approach to assess activated sludge-settling characteristics based on the morphological properties of flocs and filaments in microscopy images. Implementing the transfer learning of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, this approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing quantitative image analysis techniques. The offline microscopy image dataset was collected over two years, with weekly sampling at a full-scale industrial WWTP in Belgium. Multiple data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the generalizability of the CNN models. Various CNN architectures, including Inception v3, ResNet18, ResNet152, ConvNeXt-nano, and ConvNeXt-S, were tested to evaluate their performance in predicting sludge settling characteristics. The sludge volume index was used as the final prediction variable, but the method can easily be adjusted to predict any other settling metric of choice. The results showed that the suggested CNN-based approach provides less labour-intensive, objective, and consistent assessments, while transfer learning notably minimises the training phase, resulting in a generalizable system that can be employed in real-time applications.</description>
