      <title>Learning to Assemble the Soma Cube with Legal-Action Masked DQN and Safe ZYZ Regrasp on a Doosan M0609</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly learning. Our approach represents the first systematic integration of constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with manipulation constraints. Curriculum learning across three progressive difficulty levels (2-piece, 3-piece, 7-piece) achieves remarkable training efficiency: 100\% success rate for Level 1 within 500 episodes, 92.9\% for Level 2, and 39.9\% for Level 3 over 105,300 total training episodes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive generative moment matching networks for improved learning of dependence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks (GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion. While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories, samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second, replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&amp;P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last, both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to an improved model prediction.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Double Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when possible. We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including Dawid's model comparison theory, Dickey-Savage results, and connections to generalized ridge regression and shrinkage methods. We illustrate the approach with examples of Bayesian model selection in neural networks and provide detailed treatments of infinite Gaussian means models and non-parametric regression. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</description>
