      <title>High-Dimensional Gaussian Process Regression with Soft Kernel Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Soft Kernel Interpolation (SoftKI) designed for scalable Gaussian Process (GP) regression on high-dimensional datasets. Inspired by Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI), which approximates a GP kernel via interpolation from a structured lattice, SoftKI approximates a kernel via softmax interpolation from a smaller number of learned interpolation (i.e, inducing) points. By abandoning the lattice structure used in SKI-based methods, SoftKI separates the cost of forming an approximate GP kernel from the dimensionality of the data, making it well-suited for high-dimensional datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SoftKI across various examples, and demonstrate that its accuracy exceeds that of other scalable GP methods when the data dimensionality is modest (around $10$).</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Methods for the Noniterative Conditional Expectation G-Formula for Causal Inference from Complex Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The g-formula can be used to estimate causal effects of sustained treatment strategies using observational data under the identifying assumptions of consistency, positivity, and exchangeability. The non-iterative conditional expectation (NICE) estimator of the g-formula also requires correct estimation of the conditional distribution of the time-varying treatment, confounders, and outcome. Parametric models, which have been traditionally used for this purpose, are subject to model misspecification, which may result in biased causal estimates. Here, we propose a unified deep learning framework for the NICE g-formula estimator that uses multitask recurrent neural networks for estimation of the joint conditional distributions. Using simulated data, we evaluated our model's bias and compared it with that of the parametric g-formula estimator. We found lower bias in the estimates of the causal effect of sustained treatment strategies on a survival outcome when using the deep learning estimator compared with the parametric NICE estimator in settings with simple and complex temporal dependencies between covariates. These findings suggest that our Deep Learning g-formula estimator may be less sensitive to model misspecification than the classical parametric NICE estimator when estimating the causal effect of sustained treatment strategies from complex observational data.</description>

      <title>Refined Risk Bounds for Unbounded Losses via Transductive Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the sequential variants of linear regression with the squared loss, classification problems with hinge loss, and logistic regression, all characterized by unbounded losses in the setup where no assumptions are made on the magnitude of design vectors and the norm of the optimal vector of parameters. The key distinction from existing results lies in our assumption that the set of design vectors is known in advance (though their order is not), a setup sometimes referred to as transductive online learning. While this assumption seems similar to fixed design regression or denoising, we demonstrate that the sequential nature of our algorithms allows us to convert our bounds into statistical ones with random design without making any additional assumptions about the distribution of the design vectors--an impossibility for standard denoising results. Our key tools are based on the exponential weights algorithm with carefully chosen transductive (design-dependent) priors, which exploit the full horizon of the design vectors.
  Our classification regret bounds have a feature that is only attributed to bounded losses in the literature: they depend solely on the dimension of the parameter space and on the number of rounds, independent of the design vectors or the norm of the optimal solution. For linear regression with squared loss, we further extend our analysis to the sparse case, providing sparsity regret bounds that additionally depend on the magnitude of the response variables. We argue that these improved bounds are specific to the transductive setting and unattainable in the worst-case sequential setup. Our algorithms, in several cases, have polynomial time approximations and reduce to sampling with respect to log-concave measures instead of aggregating over hard-to-construct $\varepsilon$-covers of classes.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Multi-Task Learning on ReLU Neural Network Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of solutions to multi-task shallow ReLU neural network learning problems, wherein the network is trained to fit a dataset with minimal sum of squared weights. Remarkably, the solutions learned for each individual task resemble those obtained by solving a kernel method, revealing a novel connection between neural networks and kernel methods. It is known that single-task neural network training problems are equivalent to minimum norm interpolation problem in a non-Hilbertian Banach space, and that the solutions of such problems are generally non-unique. In contrast, we prove that the solutions to univariate-input, multi-task neural network interpolation problems are almost always unique, and coincide with the solution to a minimum-norm interpolation problem in a Sobolev (Reproducing Kernel) Hilbert Space. We also demonstrate a similar phenomenon in the multivariate-input case; specifically, we show that neural network learning problems with large numbers of diverse tasks are approximately equivalent to an $\ell^2$ (Hilbert space) minimization problem over a fixed kernel determined by the optimal neurons.</description>

      <title>Minimax optimality of deep neural networks on dependent data via PAC-Bayes bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a groundbreaking work, Schmidt-Hieber (2020) proved the minimax optimality of deep neural networks with ReLu activation for least-square regression estimation over a large class of functions defined by composition. In this paper, we extend these results in many directions. First, we remove the i.i.d. assumption on the observations, to allow some time dependence. The observations are assumed to be a Markov chain with a non-null pseudo-spectral gap. Then, we study a more general class of machine learning problems, which includes least-square and logistic regression as special cases. Leveraging on PAC-Bayes oracle inequalities and a version of Bernstein inequality due to Paulin (2015), we derive upper bounds on the estimation risk for a generalized Bayesian estimator. In the case of least-square regression, this bound matches (up to a logarithmic factor) the lower bound of Schmidt-Hieber (2020). We establish a similar lower bound for classification with the logistic loss, and prove that the proposed DNN estimator is optimal in the minimax sense.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Complexity of Estimating VENDI Scores from Empirical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for generative models have recently been studied in the machine learning community. As a reference-free metric, the VENDI score quantifies the diversity of generative models using matrix-based entropy from information theory. The VENDI score is usually computed through the eigendecomposition of an $n \times n$ kernel matrix for $n$ generated samples. However, due to the high computational cost of eigendecomposition for large $n$, the score is often computed on sample sizes limited to a few tens of thousands. In this paper, we explore the statistical convergence of the VENDI score and demonstrate that for kernel functions with an infinite feature map dimension, the evaluated score for a limited sample size may not converge to the matrix-based entropy statistic. We introduce an alternative statistic called the $t$-truncated VENDI statistic. We show that the existing Nystr\"om method and the FKEA approximation method for the VENDI score will both converge to the defined truncated VENDI statistic given a moderate sample size. We perform several numerical experiments to illustrate the concentration of the empirical VENDI score around the truncated VENDI statistic and discuss how this statistic correlates with the visual diversity of image data.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Statistical Classification of Continuous Sequences with Distribution Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiple classification, one aims to determine whether a testing sequence is generated from the same distribution as one of the M training sequences or not. Unlike most of existing studies that focus on discrete-valued sequences with perfect distribution match, we study multiple classification for continuous sequences with distribution uncertainty, where the generating distributions of the testing and training sequences deviate even under the true hypothesis. In particular, we propose distribution free tests and prove that the error probabilities of our tests decay exponentially fast for three different test designs: fixed-length, sequential, and two-phase tests. We first consider the simple case without the null hypothesis, where the testing sequence is known to be generated from a distribution close to the generating distribution of one of the training sequences. Subsequently, we generalize our results to a more general case with the null hypothesis by allowing the testing sequence to be generated from a distribution that is vastly different from the generating distributions of all training sequences.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical mixtures of Unigram models for short text clustering: the role of Beta-Liouville priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a variant of the Multinomial mixture model tailored for the unsupervised classification of short text data. Traditionally, the Multinomial probability vector in this hierarchical model is assigned a Dirichlet prior distribution. Here, however, we explore an alternative prior - the Beta-Liouville distribution - which offers a more flexible correlation structure than the Dirichlet. We examine the theoretical properties of the Beta-Liouville distribution, focusing on its conjugacy with the Multinomial likelihood. This property enables the derivation of update equations for a CAVI (Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference) variational algorithm, facilitating the approximate posterior estimation of model parameters. Additionally, we propose a stochastic variant of the CAVI algorithm that enhances scalability. The paper concludes with data examples that demonstrate effective strategies for setting the Beta-Liouville hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Identifiability Analysis of Linear ODE Systems with Hidden Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identifiability analysis of linear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) systems is a necessary prerequisite for making reliable causal inferences about these systems. While identifiability has been well studied in scenarios where the system is fully observable, the conditions for identifiability remain unexplored when latent variables interact with the system. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting a systematic analysis of identifiability in linear ODE systems incorporating hidden confounders. Specifically, we investigate two cases of such systems. In the first case, latent confounders exhibit no causal relationships, yet their evolution adheres to specific functional forms, such as polynomial functions of time $t$. Subsequently, we extend this analysis to encompass scenarios where hidden confounders exhibit causal dependencies, with the causal structure of latent variables described by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The second case represents a more intricate variation of the first case, prompting a more comprehensive identifiability analysis. Accordingly, we conduct detailed identifiability analyses of the second system under various observation conditions, including both continuous and discrete observations from single or multiple trajectories. To validate our theoretical results, we perform a series of simulations, which support and substantiate our findings.</description>

      <title>Individualised recovery trajectories of patients with impeded mobility, using distance between probability distributions of learnt graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patients who are undergoing physical rehabilitation, benefit from feedback that follows from reliable assessment of their cumulative performance attained at a given time. In this paper, we provide a method for the learning of the recovery trajectory of an individual patient, as they undertake exercises as part of their physical therapy towards recovery of their loss of movement ability, following a critical illness. The difference between the Movement Recovery Scores (MRSs) attained by a patient, when undertaking a given exercise routine on successive instances, is given by a statistical distance/divergence between the (posterior) probabilities of random graphs that are Bayesianly learnt using time series data on locations of 20 of the patient's joints, recorded on an e-platform as the patient exercises. This allows for the computation of the MRS on every occasion the patient undertakes this exercise, using which, the recovery trajectory is drawn. We learn each graph as a Random Geometric Graph drawn in a probabilistic metric space, and identify the closed-form marginal posterior of any edge of the graph, given the correlation structure of the multivariate time series data on joint locations. On the basis of our recovery learning, we offer recommendations on the optimal exercise routines for patients with given level of mobility impairment.</description>

      <title>Node Regression on Latent Position Random Graphs via Local Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node regression consists in predicting the value of a graph label at a node, given observations at the other nodes. To gain some insight into the performance of various estimators for this task, we perform a theoretical study in a context where the graph is random. Specifically, we assume that the graph is generated by a Latent Position Model, where each node of the graph has a latent position, and the probability that two nodes are connected depend on the distance between the latent positions of the two nodes. In this context, we begin by studying the simplest possible estimator for graph regression, which consists in averaging the value of the label at all neighboring nodes. We show that in Latent Position Models this estimator tends to a Nadaraya Watson estimator in the latent space, and that its rate of convergence is in fact the same. One issue with this standard estimator is that it averages over a region consisting of all neighbors of a node, and that depending on the graph model this may be too much or too little. An alternative consists in first estimating the true distances between the latent positions, then injecting these estimated distances into a classical Nadaraya Watson estimator. This enables averaging in regions either smaller or larger than the typical graph neighborhood. We show that this method can achieve standard nonparametric rates in certain instances even when the graph neighborhood is too large or too small.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on ReLU Neural Networks is Inefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the error rates of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with leapfrog integrator for Bayesian neural network inference. We show that due to the non-differentiability of activation functions in the ReLU family, leapfrog HMC for networks with these activation functions has a large local error rate of $\Omega(\epsilon)$ rather than the classical error rate of $O(\epsilon^3)$. This leads to a higher rejection rate of the proposals, making the method inefficient. We then verify our theoretical findings through empirical simulations as well as experiments on a real-world dataset that highlight the inefficiency of HMC inference on ReLU-based neural networks compared to analytical networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Q-Exponential Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by deep neural networks, the deep Gaussian process (DGP) generalizes the standard GP by stacking multiple layers of GPs. Despite the enhanced expressiveness, GP, as an $L_2$ regularization prior, tends to be over-smooth and sub-optimal for inhomogeneous subjects, such as images with edges. Recently, Q-exponential process (Q-EP) has been proposed as an $L_q$ relaxation to GP and demonstrated with more desirable regularization properties through a parameter $q&gt;0$ with $q=2$ corresponding to GP. Sharing the similar tractability of posterior and predictive distributions with GP, Q-EP can also be stacked to improve its modeling flexibility. In this paper, we generalize Q-EP to deep Q-EP to enjoy both proper regularization and improved expressiveness. The generalization is realized by introducing shallow Q-EP as a latent variable model and then building a hierarchy of the shallow Q-EP layers. Sparse approximation by inducing points and scalable variational strategy are applied to facilitate the inference. We demonstrate the numerical advantages of the proposed deep Q-EP model by comparing with multiple state-of-the-art deep probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>Batch, match, and patch: low-rank approximations for score-based variational inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) scales poorly to high dimensional problems when it is used to estimate a multivariate Gaussian approximation with a full covariance matrix. In this paper, we extend the batch-and-match (BaM) framework for score-based BBVI to problems where it is prohibitively expensive to store such covariance matrices, let alone to estimate them. Unlike classical algorithms for BBVI, which use gradient descent to minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, BaM uses more specialized updates to match the scores of the target density and its Gaussian approximation. We extend the updates for BaM by integrating them with a more compact parameterization of full covariance matrices. In particular, borrowing ideas from factor analysis, we add an extra step to each iteration of BaM -- a patch -- that projects each newly updated covariance matrix into a more efficiently parameterized family of diagonal plus low rank matrices. We evaluate this approach on a variety of synthetic target distributions and real-world problems in high-dimensional inference.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Morphology of the Galactic Center Excess with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Descriptions of the Galactic Center using Fermi gamma-ray data have so far modeled the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) as a template with fixed spatial morphology or as a linear combination of such templates. Although these templates are informed by various physical expectations, the morphology of the excess is a priori unknown. For the first time, we describe the GCE using a flexible, non-parametric machine learning model -- the Gaussian process (GP). We assess our model's performance on synthetic data, demonstrating that the model can recover the templates used to generate the data. We then fit the \Fermi data with our model in a single energy bin from 2-20 GeV (leaving a spectral GP analysis of the GCE for future work) using a variety of template models of diffuse gamma-ray emission to quantify our fits' systematic uncertainties associated with diffuse emission modeling. We interpret our best-fit GP in terms of GCE templates consisting of an NFW squared template and a bulge component to determine which bulge models can best describe the fitted GP and to what extent the best-fit GP is described better by an NFW squared template versus a bulge template. The best-fit GP contains morphological features that are typically not associated with traditional GCE studies. These include a localized bright source at around $(\ell,b) = (20^{\circ}, 0^{\circ})$ and a diagonal arm extending Northwest from the Galactic Center. In spite of these novel features, the fitted GP is explained best by a template-based model consisting of the bulge presented in Coleman et al. (2020) and a squared NFW component. Our results suggest that the physical interpretation of the GCE in terms of stellar bulge and NFW-like components is highly sensitive to the assumed morphologies, background models, and the region of the sky used for inference.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-squares lower bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis</title>

Abstract: Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) is the statistical task of finding a non-Gaussian direction in a high-dimensional dataset. Specifically, given i.i.d.\ samples from a distribution $P^A_{v}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that behaves like a known distribution $A$ in a hidden direction $v$ and like a standard Gaussian in the orthogonal complement, the goal is to approximate the hidden direction. The standard formulation posits that the first $k-1$ moments of $A$ match those of the standard Gaussian and the $k$-th moment differs. Under mild assumptions, this problem has sample complexity $O(n)$. On the other hand, all known efficient algorithms require $\Omega(n^{k/2})$ samples. Prior work developed sharp Statistical Query and low-degree testing lower bounds suggesting an information-computation tradeoff for this problem.
  Here we study the complexity of NGCA in the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) framework. Our main contribution is the first super-constant degree SoS lower bound for NGCA. Specifically, we show that if the non-Gaussian distribution $A$ matches the first $(k-1)$ moments of $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and satisfies other mild conditions, then with fewer than $n^{(1 - \varepsilon)k/2}$ many samples from the normal distribution, with high probability, degree $(\log n)^{{1\over 2}-o_n(1)}$ SoS fails to refute the existence of such a direction $v$. Our result significantly strengthens prior work by establishing a super-polynomial information-computation tradeoff against a broader family of algorithms. As corollaries, we obtain SoS lower bounds for several problems in robust statistics and the learning of mixture models.
  Our SoS lower bound proof introduces a novel technique, that we believe may be of broader interest, and a number of refinements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>L3Ms -- Lagrange Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment of large language models (LLMs) are key steps in providing a good user experience. However, the concept of an appropriate alignment is inherently application-dependent, and current methods often rely on heuristic choices to drive the optimization. In this work, we formulate SFT and alignment as a constrained optimization problem, where the LLM is trained on a task while being required to meet application-specific requirements, without resorting to heuristics. To solve this, we propose Lagrange Large Language Models (L3Ms), which employ logarithmic barriers to enforce the constraints. This approach allows for the customization of L3Ms across diverse applications while avoiding heuristic-driven processes. We demonstrate experimentally the versatility and efficacy of L3Ms in achieving tailored alignments for various applications.</description>

      <title>ATLAS: Adapting Trajectory Lengths and Step-Size for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC) and its auto-tuned variant, the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) can struggle to accurately sample distributions with complex geometries, e.g., varying curvature, due to their constant step size for leapfrog integration and fixed mass matrix. In this work, we develop a strategy to locally adapt the step size parameter of HMC at every iteration by evaluating a low-rank approximation of the local Hessian and estimating its largest eigenvalue. We combine it with a strategy to similarly adapt the trajectory length by monitoring the no U-turn condition, resulting in an adaptive sampler, ATLAS: adapting trajectory length and step-size. We further use a delayed rejection framework for making multiple proposals that improves the computational efficiency of ATLAS, and develop an approach for automatically tuning its hyperparameters during warmup. We compare ATLAS with state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS on a suite of synthetic and real world examples, and show that i) unlike NUTS, ATLAS is able to accurately sample difficult distributions with complex geometries, ii) it is computationally competitive to NUTS for simpler distributions, and iii) it is more robust to the tuning of hyperparamters.</description>

      <title>Sequential choice in ordered bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experience goods such as sporting and artistic events, songs, videos, news stories, podcasts, and television series, are often packaged and consumed in bundles. Many such bundles are ordered in the sense that the individual items are consumed sequentially, one at a time. We examine if an individual's decision to consume the next item in an ordered bundle can be predicted based on his/her consumption pattern for the preceding items. We evaluate several predictive models, including two custom Transformers using decoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures, fine-tuned GPT-3, a custom LSTM model, a reinforcement learning model, two Markov models, and a zero-order model. Using data from Spotify, we find that the custom Transformer with a decoder-only architecture provides the most accurate predictions, both for individual choices and aggregate demand. This model captures a general form of state dependence. Analysis of Transformer attention weights suggests that the consumption of the next item in a bundle is based on approximately equal weighting of all preceding choices. Our results indicate that the Transformer can assist in queuing the next item that an individual is likely to consume from an ordered bundle, predicting the demand for individual items, and personalizing promotions to increase demand.</description>

      <title>How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size, concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control on factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Depth and Looping for In-Context Learning with Task Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intriguing in-context learning (ICL) abilities of deep Transformer models have lately garnered significant attention. By studying in-context linear regression on unimodal Gaussian data, recent empirical and theoretical works have argued that ICL emerges from Transformers' abilities to simulate learning algorithms like gradient descent. However, these works fail to capture the remarkable ability of Transformers to learn multiple tasks in context. To this end, we study in-context learning for linear regression with diverse tasks, characterized by data covariance matrices with condition numbers ranging from $[1, \kappa]$, and highlight the importance of depth in this setting. More specifically, (a) we show theoretical lower bounds of $\log(\kappa)$ (or $\sqrt{\kappa}$) linear attention layers in the unrestricted (or restricted) attention setting and, (b) we show that multilayer Transformers can indeed solve such tasks with a number of layers that matches the lower bounds. However, we show that this expressivity of multilayer Transformer comes at the price of robustness. In particular, multilayer Transformers are not robust to even distributional shifts as small as $O(e^{-L})$ in Wasserstein distance, where $L$ is the depth of the network. We then demonstrate that Looped Transformers -- a special class of multilayer Transformers with weight-sharing -- not only exhibit similar expressive power but are also provably robust under mild assumptions. Besides out-of-distribution generalization, we also show that Looped Transformers are the only models that exhibit a monotonic behavior of loss with respect to depth.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric kernel-based estimator of cross-sectional conditional mean and covariance matrices for large unbalanced panels. We show its consistency and provide finite-sample guarantees. In an empirical application, we estimate conditional mean and covariance matrices for a large unbalanced panel of monthly stock excess returns given macroeconomic and firm-specific covariates from 1962 to 2021.The estimator performs well with respect to statistical measures. It is informative for empirical asset pricing, generating conditional mean-variance efficient portfolios with substantial out-of-sample Sharpe ratios far beyond equal-weighted benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Cross-Entropy Is All You Need To Invert the Data Generating Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, yet a comprehensive theory explaining its effectiveness remains elusive. Empirical phenomena, such as neural analogy-making and the linear representation hypothesis, suggest that supervised models can learn interpretable factors of variation in a linear fashion. Recent advances in self-supervised learning, particularly nonlinear Independent Component Analysis, have shown that these methods can recover latent structures by inverting the data generating process. We extend these identifiability results to parametric instance discrimination, then show how insights transfer to the ubiquitous setting of supervised learning with cross-entropy minimization. We prove that even in standard classification tasks, models learn representations of ground-truth factors of variation up to a linear transformation. We corroborate our theoretical contribution with a series of empirical studies. First, using simulated data matching our theoretical assumptions, we demonstrate successful disentanglement of latent factors. Second, we show that on DisLib, a widely-used disentanglement benchmark, simple classification tasks recover latent structures up to linear transformations. Finally, we reveal that models trained on ImageNet encode representations that permit linear decoding of proxy factors of variation. Together, our theoretical findings and experiments offer a compelling explanation for recent observations of linear representations, such as superposition in neural networks. This work takes a significant step toward a cohesive theory that accounts for the unreasonable effectiveness of supervised deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias of the general family of steepest descent algorithms, which includes gradient descent, sign descent and coordinate descent, in deep homogeneous neural networks. We prove that an algorithm-dependent geometric margin starts increasing once the networks reach perfect training accuracy and characterize the late-stage bias of the algorithms. In particular, we define a generalized notion of stationarity for optimization problems and show that the algorithms progressively reduce a (generalized) Bregman divergence, which quantifies proximity to such stationary points of a margin-maximization problem. We then experimentally zoom into the trajectories of neural networks optimized with various steepest descent algorithms, highlighting connections to the implicit bias of Adam.</description>

      <title>Where Do Large Learning Rates Lead Us?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally accepted that starting neural networks training with large learning rates (LRs) improves generalization. Following a line of research devoted to understanding this effect, we conduct an empirical study in a controlled setting focusing on two questions: 1) how large an initial LR is required for obtaining optimal quality, and 2) what are the key differences between models trained with different LRs? We discover that only a narrow range of initial LRs slightly above the convergence threshold lead to optimal results after fine-tuning with a small LR or weight averaging. By studying the local geometry of reached minima, we observe that using LRs from this optimal range allows for the optimization to locate a basin that only contains high-quality minima. Additionally, we show that these initial LRs result in a sparse set of learned features, with a clear focus on those most relevant for the task. In contrast, starting training with too small LRs leads to unstable minima and attempts to learn all features simultaneously, resulting in poor generalization. Conversely, using initial LRs that are too large fails to detect a basin with good solutions and extract meaningful patterns from the data.</description>

      <title>$r$Age-$k$: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Using Age Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative approach where multiple clients, coordinated by a parameter server (PS), train a unified machine-learning model. The approach, however, suffers from two key challenges: data heterogeneity and communication overhead. Data heterogeneity refers to inconsistencies in model training arising from heterogeneous data at different clients. Communication overhead arises from the large volumes of parameter updates exchanged between the PS and clients. Existing solutions typically address these challenges separately. This paper introduces a new communication-efficient algorithm that uses the age of information metric to simultaneously tackle both limitations of FL. We introduce age vectors at the PS, which keep track of how often the different model parameters are updated from the clients. The PS uses this to selectively request updates for specific gradient indices from each client. Further, the PS employs age vectors to identify clients with statistically similar data and group them into clusters. The PS combines the age vectors of the clustered clients to efficiently coordinate gradient index updates among clients within a cluster. We evaluate our approach using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets in highly non-i.i.d. settings. The experimental results show that our proposed method can expedite training, surpassing other communication-efficient strategies in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Abrupt Learning in Transformers: A Case Study on Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis on the training dynamics of Transformers has unveiled an interesting characteristic: the training loss plateaus for a significant number of training steps, and then suddenly (and sharply) drops to near--optimal values. To understand this phenomenon in depth, we formulate the low-rank matrix completion problem as a masked language modeling (MLM) task, and show that it is possible to train a BERT model to solve this task to low error. Furthermore, the loss curve shows a plateau early in training followed by a sudden drop to near-optimal values, despite no changes in the training procedure or hyper-parameters. To gain interpretability insights into this sudden drop, we examine the model's predictions, attention heads, and hidden states before and after this transition. Concretely, we observe that (a) the model transitions from simply copying the masked input to accurately predicting the masked entries; (b) the attention heads transition to interpretable patterns relevant to the task; and (c) the embeddings and hidden states encode information relevant to the problem. We also analyze the training dynamics of individual model components to understand the sudden drop in loss.</description>

      <title>Model-free Estimation of Latent Structure via Multiscale Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate distributions often carry latent structures that are difficult to identify and estimate, and which better reflect the data generating mechanism than extrinsic structures exhibited simply by the raw data. In this paper, we propose a model-free approach for estimating such latent structures whenever they are present, without assuming they exist a priori. Given an arbitrary density $p_0$, we construct a multiscale representation of the density and propose data-driven methods for selecting representative models that capture meaningful discrete structure. Our approach uses a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the latent structure at different scales and we further characterize their asymptotic limits. By carrying out such a multiscale analysis, we obtain coarseto-fine structures inherent in the original distribution, which are integrated via a model selection procedure to yield an interpretable discrete representation of it. As an application, we design a clustering algorithm based on the proposed procedure and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing a wide range of latent structures.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel layer-wise parameterization for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that includes built-in robustness guarantees by enforcing a prescribed Lipschitz bound. Each layer in our parameterization is designed to satisfy a linear matrix inequality (LMI), which in turn implies dissipativity with respect to a specific supply rate. Collectively, these layer-wise LMIs ensure Lipschitz boundedness for the input-output mapping of the neural network, yielding a more expressive parameterization than through spectral bounds or orthogonal layers. Our new method LipKernel directly parameterizes dissipative convolution kernels using a 2-D Roesser-type state space model. This means that the convolutional layers are given in standard form after training and can be evaluated without computational overhead. In numerical experiments, we show that the run-time using our method is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art Lipschitz-bounded networks that parameterize convolutions in the Fourier domain, making our approach particularly attractive for improving robustness of learning-based real-time perception or control in robotics, autonomous vehicles, or automation systems. We focus on CNNs, and in contrast to previous works, our approach accommodates a wide variety of layers typically used in CNNs, including 1-D and 2-D convolutional layers, maximum and average pooling layers, as well as strided and dilated convolutions and zero padding. However, our approach naturally extends beyond CNNs as we can incorporate any layer that is incrementally dissipative.</description>

      <title>Fourier Head: Helping Large Language Models Learn Complex Probability Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the quality of large language models has improved, there has been increased interest in using them to model non-linguistic tokens. For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns by 46% on the Atari Seaquest game, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</description>

      <title>Shuffling Gradient-Based Methods for Nonconvex-Concave Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at developing novel shuffling gradient-based methods for tackling two classes of minimax problems: nonconvex-linear and nonconvex-strongly concave settings. The first algorithm addresses the nonconvex-linear minimax model and achieves the state-of-the-art oracle complexity typically observed in nonconvex optimization. It also employs a new shuffling estimator for the "hyper-gradient", departing from standard shuffling techniques in optimization. The second method consists of two variants: semi-shuffling and full-shuffling schemes. These variants tackle the nonconvex-strongly concave minimax setting. We establish their oracle complexity bounds under standard assumptions, which, to our best knowledge, are the best-known for this specific setting. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare them with two other methods. Our results show that the new methods achieve comparable performance with SGD, supporting the potential of incorporating shuffling strategies into minimax algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Posterior Samples for Bayesian Optimization via Rootfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior samples, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploitation and exploration. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions. For posterior sample-based acquisition functions such as Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS) and variants of entropy search, we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. We also propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/UQUH/TSRoots .</description>

Abstract: Adapting machine learning algorithms to better handle the presence of clusters or batch effects within training datasets is important across a wide variety of biological applications. This article considers the effect of ensembling Random Forest learners trained on clusters within a single dataset with heterogeneity in the distribution of the features. We find that constructing ensembles of forests trained on clusters determined by algorithms such as k-means results in significant improvements in accuracy and generalizability over the traditional Random Forest algorithm. We begin with a theoretical exploration of the benefits of our novel approach, denoted as the Cross-Cluster Weighted Forest, and subsequently empirically examine its robustness to various data-generating scenarios and outcome models. Furthermore, we explore the influence of the data-partitioning and ensemble weighting strategies the benefits of our method over the existing paradigm. Finally, we apply our approach to cancer molecular profiling and gene expression datasets that are naturally divisible into clusters and illustrate that our approach outperforms the classic Random Forest.

      <title>On the potential benefits of entropic regularization for smoothing Wasserstein estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the study of entropic regularization in optimal transport as a smoothing method for Wasserstein estimators, through the prism of the classical tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in statistics. Wasserstein estimators are defined as solutions of variational problems whose objective function involves the use of an optimal transport cost between probability measures. Such estimators can be regularized by replacing the optimal transport cost by its regularized version using an entropy penalty on the transport plan. The use of such a regularization has a potentially significant smoothing effect on the resulting estimators. In this work, we investigate its potential benefits on the approximation and estimation properties of regularized Wasserstein estimators. Our main contribution is to discuss how entropic regularization may reach, at a lower computational cost, statistical performances that are comparable to those of un-regularized Wasserstein estimators in statistical learning problems involving distributional data analysis. To this end, we present new theoretical results on the convergence of regularized Wasserstein estimators. We also study their numerical performances using simulated and real data in the supervised learning problem of proportions estimation in mixture models using optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Efficient Convex Algorithms for Universal Kernel Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy and complexity of machine learning algorithms based on kernel optimization are determined by the set of kernels over which they are able to optimize. An ideal set of kernels should: admit a linear parameterization (for tractability); be dense in the set of all kernels (for robustness); be universal (for accuracy). Recently, a framework was proposed for using positive matrices to parameterize a class of positive semi-separable kernels. Although this class can be shown to meet all three criteria, previous algorithms for optimization of such kernels were limited to classification and furthermore relied on computationally complex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) algorithms. In this paper, we pose the problem of learning semiseparable kernels as a minimax optimization problem and propose a SVD-QCQP primal-dual algorithm which dramatically reduces the computational complexity as compared with previous SDP-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide an efficient implementation of this algorithm for both classification and regression -- an implementation which enables us to solve problems with 100 features and up to 30,000 datums. Finally, when applied to benchmark data, the algorithm demonstrates the potential for significant improvement in accuracy over typical (but non-convex) approaches such as Neural Nets and Random Forest with similar or better computation time.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws of Absorbing Phase Transitions in Artificial Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that conventional artificial deep neural networks operating near the phase boundary of the signal propagation dynamics, also known as the edge of chaos, exhibit universal scaling laws of absorbing phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our numerical results indicate that the multilayer perceptrons and the convolutional neural networks belong to the mean-field and the directed percolation universality classes, respectively. Also, the finite-size scaling is successfully applied, suggesting a potential connection to the depth-width trade-off in deep learning. Furthermore, our analysis of the training dynamics under gradient descent reveals that hyperparameter tuning to the phase boundary is necessary but insufficient for achieving optimal generalization in deep networks. Remarkably, nonuniversal metric factors associated with the scaling laws are shown to play a significant role in concretizing the above observations. These findings highlight the usefulness of the notion of criticality for analyzing the behavior of artificial deep neural networks and offer new insights toward a unified understanding of an essential relationship between criticality and intelligence.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Optimality of Invariant Risk Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often inherit spurious correlations embedded in training data and hence may fail to generalize to unseen domains, which have different distributions from the domain to provide training data. M. Arjovsky et al. (2019) introduced the concept out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) risk, which is the maximum risk among all domains, and formulated the issue caused by spurious correlations as a minimization problem of the o.o.d. risk. Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) is considered to be a promising approach to minimize the o.o.d. risk: IRM estimates a minimum of the o.o.d. risk by solving a bi-level optimization problem. While IRM has attracted considerable attention with empirical success, it comes with few theoretical guarantees. Especially, a solid theoretical guarantee that the bi-level optimization problem gives the minimum of the o.o.d. risk has not yet been established. Aiming at providing a theoretical justification for IRM, this paper rigorously proves that a solution to the bi-level optimization problem minimizes the o.o.d. risk under certain conditions. The result also provides sufficient conditions on distributions providing training data and on a dimension of feature space for the bi-leveled optimization problem to minimize the o.o.d. risk.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of model selection in a high-dimensional sparse linear regression model under privacy constraints. We propose a differentially private (DP) best subset selection method with strong statistical utility properties by adopting the well-known exponential mechanism for selecting the best model. To achieve computational expediency, we propose an efficient Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and under certain regularity conditions, we establish that it enjoys polynomial mixing time to its stationary distribution. As a result, we also establish both approximate differential privacy and statistical utility for the estimates of the mixed Metropolis-Hastings chain. Finally, we perform some illustrative experiments on simulated data showing that our algorithm can quickly identify active features under reasonable privacy budget constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference methods that feature correct conditional coverage of confidence sets based on observations that have been compressed to a scalar test statistic require accurate modeling of either the p-value function or the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the test statistic. If the model of the cdf, which is typically a deep neural network, is a function of the test statistic then the derivative of the neural network with respect to the test statistic furnishes an approximation of the sampling distribution of the test statistic. We explore whether this approach to modeling conditional 1-dimensional sampling distributions is a viable alternative to the probability density-ratio method, also known as the likelihood-ratio trick. Relatively simple, yet effective, neural network models are used whose predictive uncertainty is quantified through a variety of methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High dimensional sparse linear bandits serve as an efficient model for sequential decision-making problems (e.g. personalized medicine), where high dimensional features (e.g. genomic data) on the users are available, but only a small subset of them are relevant. Motivated by data privacy concerns in these applications, we study the joint differentially private high dimensional sparse linear bandits, where both rewards and contexts are considered as private data. First, to quantify the cost of privacy, we derive a lower bound on the regret achievable in this setting. To further address the problem, we design a computationally efficient bandit algorithm, \textbf{F}orgetfu\textbf{L} \textbf{I}terative \textbf{P}rivate \textbf{HA}rd \textbf{T}hresholding (FLIPHAT). Along with doubling of episodes and episodic forgetting, FLIPHAT deploys a variant of Noisy Iterative Hard Thresholding (N-IHT) algorithm as a sparse linear regression oracle to ensure both privacy and regret-optimality. We show that FLIPHAT achieves optimal regret in terms of privacy parameters $\epsilon, \delta$, context dimension $d$, and time horizon $T$ up to a linear factor in model sparsity and logarithmic factor in $d$. We analyze the regret by providing a novel refined analysis of the estimation error of N-IHT, which is of parallel interest.</description>

      <title>Rough Transformers: Lightweight Continuous-Time Sequence Modelling with Path Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose multi-view signature attention, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expectation propagation (EP) is a family of algorithms for performing approximate inference in probabilistic models. The updates of EP involve the evaluation of moments -- expectations of certain functions -- which can be estimated from Monte Carlo (MC) samples. However, the updates are not robust to MC noise when performed naively, and various prior works have attempted to address this issue in different ways. In this work, we provide a novel perspective on the moment-matching updates of EP; namely, that they perform natural-gradient-based optimisation of a variational objective. We use this insight to motivate two new EP variants, with updates that are particularly well-suited to MC estimation. They remain stable and are most sample-efficient when estimated with just a single sample. These new variants combine the benefits of their predecessors and address key weaknesses. In particular, they are easier to tune, offer an improved speed-accuracy trade-off, and do not rely on the use of debiasing estimators. We demonstrate their efficacy on a variety of probabilistic inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Decomposed Linear Dynamical Systems for Robust Discovery of Latent Neural Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying linear state-space models are powerful tools for obtaining mathematically interpretable representations of neural signals. For example, switching and decomposed models describe complex systems using latent variables that evolve according to simple locally linear dynamics. However, existing methods for latent variable estimation are not robust to dynamical noise and system nonlinearity due to noise-sensitive inference procedures and limited model formulations. This can lead to inconsistent results on signals with similar dynamics, limiting the model's ability to provide scientific insight. In this work, we address these limitations and propose a probabilistic approach to latent variable estimation in decomposed models that improves robustness against dynamical noise. Additionally, we introduce an extended latent dynamics model to improve robustness against system nonlinearities. We evaluate our approach on several synthetic dynamical systems, including an empirically-derived brain-computer interface experiment, and demonstrate more accurate latent variable inference in nonlinear systems with diverse noise conditions. Furthermore, we apply our method to a real-world clinical neurophysiology dataset, illustrating the ability to identify interpretable and coherent structure where previous models cannot.</description>

      <title>Stream-level flow matching from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocate the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocity of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Bayesian Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider Bayesian inference associated to deep neural networks (DNNs) and in particular, trace-class neural network (TNN) priors which can be preferable to traditional DNNs as (a) they are identifiable and (b) they possess desirable convergence properties. TNN priors are defined on functions with infinitely many hidden units, and have strongly convergent Karhunen-Loeve-type approximations with finitely many hidden units. A practical hurdle is that the Bayesian solution is computationally demanding, requiring simulation methods, so approaches to drive down the complexity are needed. In this paper, we leverage the strong convergence of TNN in order to apply Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) to these models. In particular, an MLMC method that was introduced is used to approximate posterior expectations of Bayesian TNN models with optimal computational complexity, and this is mathematically proved. The results are verified with several numerical experiments on model problems arising in machine learning, including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Federated Averaging under Partial Participation for Over-parameterized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely employed distributed paradigm for collaboratively training machine learning models from multiple clients without sharing local data. In practice, FL encounters challenges in dealing with partial client participation due to the limited bandwidth, intermittent connection and strict synchronized delay. Simultaneously, there exist few theoretical convergence guarantees in this practical setting, especially when associated with the non-convex optimization of neural networks. To bridge this gap, we focus on the training problem of federated averaging (FedAvg) method for two canonical models: a deep linear network and a two-layer ReLU network. Under the over-parameterized assumption, we provably show that FedAvg converges to a global minimum at a linear rate $\mathcal{O}\left((1-\frac{min_{i \in [t]}|S_i|}{N^2})^t\right)$ after $t$ iterations, where $N$ is the number of clients and $|S_i|$ is the number of the participated clients in the $i$-th iteration. Experimental evaluations confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Externally Valid Policy Evaluation Combining Trial and Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized trials are widely considered as the gold standard for evaluating the effects of decision policies. Trial data is, however, drawn from a population which may differ from the intended target population and this raises a problem of external validity (aka. generalizability). In this paper we seek to use trial data to draw valid inferences about the outcome of a policy on the target population. Additional covariate data from the target population is used to model the sampling of individuals in the trial study. We develop a method that yields certifiably valid trial-based policy evaluations under any specified range of model miscalibrations. The method is nonparametric and the validity is assured even with finite samples. The certified policy evaluations are illustrated using both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware multi-fidelity surrogate modeling with noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emulating high-accuracy computationally expensive models is crucial for tasks requiring numerous model evaluations, such as uncertainty quantification and optimization. When lower-fidelity models are available, they can be used to improve the predictions of high-fidelity models. Multi-fidelity surrogate models combine information from sources of varying fidelities to construct an efficient surrogate model. However, in real-world applications, uncertainty is present in both high- and low-fidelity models due to measurement or numerical noise, as well as lack of knowledge due to the limited experimental design budget. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling that handles noise-contaminated data and is able to estimate the underlying noise-free high-fidelity model. Our methodology quantitatively incorporates the different types of uncertainty affecting the problem and emphasizes on delivering precise estimates of the uncertainty in its predictions both with respect to the underlying high-fidelity model and unseen noise-contaminated high-fidelity observations, presented through confidence and prediction intervals, respectively. Additionally, the proposed framework offers a natural approach to combining physical experiments and computational models by treating noisy experimental data as high-fidelity sources and white-box computational models as their low-fidelity counterparts. The effectiveness of our methodology is showcased through synthetic examples and a wind turbine application.</description>

      <title>OptEx: Expediting First-Order Optimization with Approximately Parallelized Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order optimization (FOO) algorithms are pivotal in numerous computational domains such as machine learning and signal denoising. However, their application to complex tasks like neural network training often entails significant inefficiencies due to the need for many sequential iterations for convergence. In response, we introduce first-order optimization expedited with approximately parallelized iterations (OptEx), the first framework that enhances the efficiency of FOO by leveraging parallel computing to mitigate its iterative bottleneck. OptEx employs kernelized gradient estimation to make use of gradient history for future gradient prediction, enabling parallelization of iterations -- a strategy once considered impractical because of the inherent iterative dependency in FOO. We provide theoretical guarantees for the reliability of our kernelized gradient estimation and the iteration complexity of SGD-based OptEx, confirming that estimation errors diminish to zero as historical gradients accumulate and that SGD-based OptEx enjoys an effective acceleration rate of $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ over standard SGD given parallelism of N. We also use extensive empirical studies, including synthetic functions, reinforcement learning tasks, and neural network training across various datasets, to underscore the substantial efficiency improvements achieved by OptEx.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces a new estimator of average treatment effects under unobserved confounding in modern data-rich environments featuring large numbers of units and outcomes. The proposed estimator is doubly robust, combining outcome imputation, inverse probability weighting, and a novel cross-fitting procedure for matrix completion. We derive finite-sample and asymptotic guarantees, and show that the error of the new estimator converges to a mean-zero Gaussian distribution at a parametric rate. Simulation results demonstrate the relevance of the formal properties of the estimators analyzed in this article.</description>

      <title>Propensity Score Alignment of Unpaired Multimodal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning techniques typically rely on paired samples to learn common representations, but paired samples are challenging to collect in fields such as biology where measurement devices often destroy the samples. This paper presents an approach to address the challenge of aligning unpaired samples across disparate modalities in multimodal representation learning. We draw an analogy between potential outcomes in causal inference and potential views in multimodal observations, which allows us to use Rubin's framework to estimate a common space in which to match samples. Our approach assumes we collect samples that are experimentally perturbed by treatments, and uses this to estimate a propensity score from each modality, which encapsulates all shared information between a latent state and treatment and can be used to define a distance between samples. We experiment with two alignment techniques that leverage this distance -- shared nearest neighbours (SNN) and optimal transport (OT) matching -- and find that OT matching results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art alignment approaches in both a synthetic multi-modal setting and in real-world data from NeurIPS Multimodal Single-Cell Integration Challenge.</description>

      <title>Causal Effect Identification in a Sub-Population with Latent Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The s-ID problem seeks to compute a causal effect in a specific sub-population from the observational data pertaining to the same sub population (Abouei et al., 2023). This problem has been addressed when all the variables in the system are observable. In this paper, we consider an extension of the s-ID problem that allows for the presence of latent variables. To tackle the challenges induced by the presence of latent variables in a sub-population, we first extend the classical relevant graphical definitions, such as c-components and Hedges, initially defined for the so-called ID problem (Pearl, 1995; Tian &amp; Pearl, 2002), to their new counterparts. Subsequently, we propose a sound algorithm for the s-ID problem with latent variables.</description>

      <title>PaGoDA: Progressive Growing of a One-Step Generator from a Low-Resolution Diffusion Teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion model performs remarkable in generating high-dimensional content but is computationally intensive, especially during training. We propose Progressive Growing of Diffusion Autoencoder (PaGoDA), a novel pipeline that reduces the training costs through three stages: training diffusion on downsampled data, distilling the pretrained diffusion, and progressive super-resolution. With the proposed pipeline, PaGoDA achieves a $64\times$ reduced cost in training its diffusion model on 8x downsampled data; while at the inference, with the single-step, it performs state-of-the-art on ImageNet across all resolutions from 64x64 to 512x512, and text-to-image. PaGoDA's pipeline can be applied directly in the latent space, adding compression alongside the pre-trained autoencoder in Latent Diffusion Models (e.g., Stable Diffusion). The code is available at https://github.com/sony/pagoda.</description>

      <title>Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</description>

      <title>The Poisson Midpoint Method for Langevin Dynamics: Provably Efficient Discretization for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langevin Dynamics is a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) central to sampling and generative modeling and is implemented via time discretization. Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.</description>

      <title>Single-Loop Stochastic Algorithms for Difference of Max-Structured Weakly Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of non-smooth non-convex problems in the form of $\min_{x}[\max_{y\in Y}\phi(x, y) - \max_{z\in Z}\psi(x, z)]$, where both $\Phi(x) = \max_{y\in Y}\phi(x, y)$ and $\Psi(x)=\max_{z\in Z}\psi(x, z)$ are weakly convex functions, and $\phi(x, y), \psi(x, z)$ are strongly concave functions in terms of $y$ and $z$, respectively. It covers two families of problems that have been studied but are missing single-loop stochastic algorithms, i.e., difference of weakly convex functions and weakly convex strongly-concave min-max problems. We propose a stochastic Moreau envelope approximate gradient method dubbed SMAG, the first single-loop algorithm for solving these problems, and provide a state-of-the-art non-asymptotic convergence rate. The key idea of the design is to compute an approximate gradient of the Moreau envelopes of $\Phi, \Psi$ using only one step of stochastic gradient update of the primal and dual variables. Empirically, we conduct experiments on positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and partial area under ROC curve (pAUC) optimization with an adversarial fairness regularizer to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayesian Active Learning for Preference Modeling in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging human preferences for steering the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated notable success in recent years. Nonetheless, data selection and labeling are still a bottleneck for these systems, particularly at large scale. Hence, selecting the most informative points for acquiring human feedback may considerably reduce the cost of preference labeling and unleash the further development of LLMs. Bayesian Active Learning provides a principled framework for addressing this challenge and has demonstrated remarkable success in diverse settings. However, previous attempts to employ it for Preference Modeling did not meet such expectations. In this work, we identify that naive epistemic uncertainty estimation leads to the acquisition of redundant samples. We address this by proposing the Bayesian Active Learner for Preference Modeling (BAL-PM), a novel stochastic acquisition policy that not only targets points of high epistemic uncertainty according to the preference model but also seeks to maximize the entropy of the acquired prompt distribution in the feature space spanned by the employed LLM. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that BAL-PM requires 33% to 68% fewer preference labels in two popular human preference datasets and exceeds previous stochastic Bayesian acquisition policies.</description>

      <title>ROTI-GCV: Generalized Cross-Validation for right-ROTationally Invariant Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two key tasks in high-dimensional regularized regression are tuning the regularization strength for accurate predictions and estimating the out-of-sample risk. It is known that the standard approach -- $k$-fold cross-validation -- is inconsistent in modern high-dimensional settings. While leave-one-out and generalized cross-validation remain consistent in some high-dimensional cases, they become inconsistent when samples are dependent or contain heavy-tailed covariates. As a first step towards modeling structured sample dependence and heavy tails, we use right-rotationally invariant covariate distributions -- a crucial concept from compressed sensing. In the proportional asymptotics regime where the number of features and samples grow comparably, which is known to better reflect the empirical behavior in moderately sized datasets, we introduce a new framework, ROTI-GCV, for reliably performing cross-validation under these challenging conditions. Along the way, we propose new estimators for the signal-to-noise ratio and noise variance. We conduct experiments that demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in a variety of synthetic and semi-synthetic settings.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how ESG rating disagreement (Dis) affects corporate total factor productivity (TFP) in China based on data of A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2022. We find that Dis reduces TFP, especially in state-owned, non-capital-intensive, and low-pollution firms. Mechanism analysis shows that green innovation strengthens the dampening effect of Dis on TFP, and that Dis lowers corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints. Furthermore, XGBoost regression demonstrates that Dis plays a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP showing that the dampening effect of ESG rating disagreement on TFP is still pronounced in firms with large Dis values.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Supervised and Reinforcement Learning in the Non-Linear Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of a brain or a neural network to efficiently learn depends crucially on both the task structure and the learning rule. Previous works have analyzed the dynamical equations describing learning in the relatively simplified context of the perceptron under assumptions of a student-teacher framework or a linearized output. While these assumptions have facilitated theoretical understanding, they have precluded a detailed understanding of the roles of the nonlinearity and input-data distribution in determining the learning dynamics, limiting the applicability of the theories to real biological or artificial neural networks. Here, we use a stochastic-process approach to derive flow equations describing learning, applying this framework to the case of a nonlinear perceptron performing binary classification. We characterize the effects of the learning rule (supervised or reinforcement learning, SL/RL) and input-data distribution on the perceptron's learning curve and the forgetting curve as subsequent tasks are learned. In particular, we find that the input-data noise differently affects the learning speed under SL vs. RL, as well as determines how quickly learning of a task is overwritten by subsequent learning. Additionally, we verify our approach with real data using the MNIST dataset. This approach points a way toward analyzing learning dynamics for more-complex circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive preference learning systems present humans with queries as pairs of options; humans then select their preferred choice, allowing the system to infer preferences from these binary choices. While binary choice feedback is simple and widely used, it offers limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which inversely correlate with preference strength, as complementary information. We introduce a computationally efficient method based on the EZ-diffusion model, combining choices and response times to estimate the underlying human utility function. Theoretical and empirical comparisons with traditional choice-only estimators show that for queries where humans have strong preferences (i.e., "easy" queries), response times provide valuable complementary information and enhance utility estimates. We integrate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating response times significantly accelerates preference learning.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Viewpoint on Differential Privacy: Hypothesis Testing, Representation and Blackwell's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy is widely considered the formal privacy for privacy-preserving data analysis due to its robust and rigorous guarantees, with increasingly broad adoption in public services, academia, and industry. Despite originating in the cryptographic context, in this review paper we argue that, fundamentally, differential privacy can be considered a \textit{pure} statistical concept. By leveraging David Blackwell's informativeness theorem, our focus is to demonstrate based on prior work that all definitions of differential privacy can be formally motivated from a hypothesis testing perspective, thereby showing that hypothesis testing is not merely convenient but also the right language for reasoning about differential privacy. This insight leads to the definition of $f$-differential privacy, which extends other differential privacy definitions through a representation theorem. We review techniques that render $f$-differential privacy a unified framework for analyzing privacy bounds in data analysis and machine learning. Applications of this differential privacy definition to private deep learning, private convex optimization, shuffled mechanisms, and U.S.\ Census data are discussed to highlight the benefits of analyzing privacy bounds under this framework compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Generalize on Low Complexity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d. data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number, and more. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d. sample of $\Theta(N^{\delta}\ln N)$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$, where $\delta\in (0,1)$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then with high probability, the MDL network fitted to this data accurately answers whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not, with test error $\leq O(N^{-\delta})$. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so.</description>

      <title>Does Worst-Performing Agent Lead the Pack? Analyzing Agent Dynamics in Unified Distributed SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning is essential to train machine learning algorithms across heterogeneous agents while maintaining data privacy. We conduct an asymptotic analysis of Unified Distributed SGD (UD-SGD), exploring a variety of communication patterns, including decentralized SGD and local SGD within Federated Learning (FL), as well as the increasing communication interval in the FL setting. In this study, we assess how different sampling strategies, such as i.i.d. sampling, shuffling, and Markovian sampling, affect the convergence speed of UD-SGD by considering the impact of agent dynamics on the limiting covariance matrix as described in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Our findings not only support existing theories on linear speedup and asymptotic network independence, but also theoretically and empirically show how efficient sampling strategies employed by individual agents contribute to overall convergence in UD-SGD. Simulations reveal that a few agents using highly efficient sampling can achieve or surpass the performance of the majority employing moderately improved strategies, providing new insights beyond traditional analyses focusing on the worst-performing agent.</description>

      <title>A Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine with Mixture of Wasserstein Balls Ambiguity Set for Distributed Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training of classification models for fault diagnosis tasks using geographically dispersed data is a crucial task for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) seeking to provide long-term service contracts (LTSCs) to their customers. Due to privacy and bandwidth constraints, such models must be trained in a federated fashion. Moreover, due to harsh industrial settings the data often suffers from feature and label uncertainty. Therefore, we study the problem of training a distributionally robust (DR) support vector machine (SVM) in a federated fashion over a network comprised of a central server and $G$ clients without sharing data. We consider the setting where the local data of each client $g$ is sampled from a unique true distribution $\mathbb{P}_g$, and the clients can only communicate with the central server. We propose a novel Mixture of Wasserstein Balls (MoWB) ambiguity set that relies on local Wasserstein balls centered at the empirical distribution of the data at each client. We study theoretical aspects of the proposed ambiguity set, deriving its out-of-sample performance guarantees and demonstrating that it naturally allows for the separability of the DR problem. Subsequently, we propose two distributed optimization algorithms for training the global FDR-SVM: i) a subgradient method-based algorithm, and ii) an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. We derive the optimization problems to be solved by each client and provide closed-form expressions for the computations performed by the central server during each iteration for both algorithms. Finally, we thoroughly examine the performance of the proposed algorithms in a series of numerical experiments utilizing both simulation data and popular real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Variational Language Concepts for Interpreting Foundation Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation Language Models (FLMs) such as BERT and its variants have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. To date, the interpretability of FLMs has primarily relied on the attention weights in their self-attention layers. However, these attention weights only provide word-level interpretations, failing to capture higher-level structures, and are therefore lacking in readability and intuitiveness. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of conceptual interpretation and then propose a variational Bayesian framework, dubbed VAriational Language Concept (VALC), to go beyond word-level interpretations and provide concept-level interpretations. Our theoretical analysis shows that our VALC finds the optimal language concepts to interpret FLM predictions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that our method can successfully provide conceptual interpretation for FLMs.</description>

      <title>Understanding Warmup-Stable-Decay Learning Rates: A River Valley Loss Landscape Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training language models currently requires pre-determining a fixed compute budget because the typical cosine learning rate schedule depends on the total number of steps. In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a constant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in principle continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then, given any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper at any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model. Empirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains elevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase. Towards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss exhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river at its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the iterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it progresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly dropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer to the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained high learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress in the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical. Our analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and shows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram dataset. Inspired by the theory, we introduce WSD-S, a variant of WSD that reuses previous checkpoints' decay phases and keeps only one main branch, where we resume from a decayed checkpoint. WSD-S empirically outperforms WSD and Cyclic-Cosine in obtaining multiple language model checkpoints across various compute budgets in a single run for parameters scaling from 0.1B to 1.2B.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of classifying graphs is ubiquitous in machine learning. While it is standard to apply graph neural networks or graph kernel methods, Gaussian processes can be employed by transforming spatial features from the graph domain into spectral features in the Euclidean domain, and using them as input points. However, this approach only takes into account features on vertices, whereas some graph datasets also support features on edges. In this work, we present a Gaussian process-based classification algorithm that can leverage one or both vertex and edges features. Furthermore, we take advantage of the Hodge decomposition to better capture the intricate richness of vertex and edge features, which can be beneficial on diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality across many applications, but their ability to capture rare or extreme events in heavy-tailed distributions remains unclear. In this work, we show that traditional diffusion and flow-matching models with standard Gaussian priors fail to capture heavy-tailed behavior. We address this by repurposing the diffusion framework for heavy-tail estimation using multivariate Student-t distributions. We develop a tailored perturbation kernel and derive the denoising posterior based on the conditional Student-t distribution for the backward process. Inspired by $\gamma$-divergence for heavy-tailed distributions, we derive a training objective for heavy-tailed denoisers. The resulting framework introduces controllable tail generation using only a single scalar hyperparameter, making it easily tunable for diverse real-world distributions. As specific instantiations of our framework, we introduce t-EDM and t-Flow, extensions of existing diffusion and flow models that employ a Student-t prior. Remarkably, our approach is readily compatible with standard Gaussian diffusion models and requires only minimal code changes. Empirically, we show that our t-EDM and t-Flow outperform standard diffusion models in heavy-tail estimation on high-resolution weather datasets in which generating rare and extreme events is crucial.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Network Training via Subset Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In training neural networks, it is common practice to use partial gradients computed over batches, mostly very small subsets of the training set. This approach is motivated by the argument that such a partial gradient is close to the true one, with precision growing only with the square root of the batch size. A theoretical justification is with the help of stochastic approximation theory. However, the conditions for the validity of this theory are not satisfied in the usual learning rate schedules. Batch processing is also difficult to combine with efficient second-order optimization methods. This proposal is based on another hypothesis: the loss minimum of the training set can be expected to be well-approximated by the minima of its subsets. Such subset minima can be computed in a fraction of the time necessary for optimizing over the whole training set. This hypothesis has been tested with the help of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks, optionally extended by training data augmentation. The experiments have confirmed that results equivalent to conventional training can be reached. In summary, even small subsets are representative if the overdetermination ratio for the given model parameter set sufficiently exceeds unity. The computing expense can be reduced to a tenth or less.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models may capture and amplify biases present in data, leading to disparate test performance across social groups. To better understand, evaluate, and mitigate these possible biases, a deeper theoretical understanding of how model design choices and data distribution properties could contribute to bias is needed. In this work, we contribute a precise analytical theory in the context of ridge regression, both with and without random projections, where the former models neural networks in a simplified regime. Our theory offers a unified and rigorous explanation of machine learning bias, providing insights into phenomena such as bias amplification and minority-group bias in various feature and parameter regimes. For example, we demonstrate that there may be an optimal regularization penalty or training time to avoid bias amplification, and there can be fundamental differences in test error between groups that do not vanish with increased parameterization. Importantly, our theoretical predictions align with several empirical observations reported in the literature. We extensively empirically validate our theory on diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Globally Attracting Fixed Points in Deep Neural Networks With Nonlinear Activations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural networks transform input data across layers is fundamental to unraveling their learning and generalization capabilities. Although prior work has used insights from kernel methods to study neural networks, a global analysis of how the similarity between hidden representations evolves across layers remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for the evolution of the kernel sequence, which measures the similarity between the hidden representation for two different inputs. Operating under the mean-field regime, we show that the kernel sequence evolves deterministically via a kernel map, which only depends on the activation function. By expanding activation using Hermite polynomials and using their algebraic properties, we derive an explicit form for kernel map and fully characterize its fixed points. Our analysis reveals that for nonlinear activations, the kernel sequence converges globally to a unique fixed point, which can correspond to orthogonal or similar representations depending on the activation and network architecture. We further extend our results to networks with residual connections and normalization layers, demonstrating similar convergence behaviors. This work provides new insights into the implicit biases of deep neural networks and how architectural choices influence the evolution of representations across layers.</description>

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in networks is an important step in modelling relationships and interactions between entities. We consider the challenge of bootstrapping an inhomogeneous random graph when only a single observation of the network is made and the underlying data generating function is unknown. We utilise an exchangeable network test that can empirically validate bootstrap samples generated by any method, by testing if the observed and bootstrapped networks are statistically distinguishable. We find that existing methods fail this test. To address this, we propose a principled, novel, distribution-free network bootstrap using k-nearest neighbour smoothing, that can regularly pass this exchangeable network test in both synthetic and real-data scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of this work in combination with the popular data visualisation method t-SNE, where uncertainty estimates from bootstrapping are used to explain whether visible structures represent real statistically sound structures.</description>
