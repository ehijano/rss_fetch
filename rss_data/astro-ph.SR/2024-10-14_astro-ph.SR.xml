      <title>Near-Infrared Spectroscopy of the Sun and Solar Analog Star HD 76151: Compiling an Extensive Line List in Y-, J-, H-, and K-Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the physical nature of a star requires precise knowledge of its stellar atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. This study presents a new atomic line list covering a broad spectral range (1-2.5 $\mu$m; $YJHK$-bands) for iron (Fe) and $\alpha$-elements (Ca, Mg, Ti, Si) to improve stellar parameter determination using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. We highlight the limitations of existing line lists, stemming primarily from inconsistencies in oscillator strengths for ionized iron lines within the APOGEE DR17. The line list was validated using the high-resolution and high-quality disc-center NIR spectra of the Sun and its solar analog HD 76151. As a result of the spectroscopic analyses, the effective temperature of HD 76151 was calculated as 5790$\pm$170 K, surface gravity as 4.35$\pm$0.18 cgs, metal abundance as 0.24$\pm$0.09 dex, and microturbulence velocity of 0.30$^{\rm +0.5}_{\rm -0.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ by combining the optical and NIR line lists. A comparison of the model atmospheric parameters calculated for HD 76151 with the PARSEC isochrones resulted in a stellar mass of $1.053_{-0.068}^{+0.056} M_{\odot}$, radius $1.125_{-0.011}^{+0.035} R_{\odot}$, and an age of 5.5$^{\rm +2.5}_{\rm -2.1}$ Gyr. For the first time, kinematic and dynamical orbital analyses of HD 76151 using a combination of Gaia astrometric and spectroscopic data showed that the star was born in a metal-rich region within the Solar circle and is a member of the thin disc population. Thus, the slightly metal-rich nature of the star, as reflected in its spectroscopic analysis, was confirmed by dynamical orbital analysis.</description>

      <title>Connecting integrated RGB mass loss from asteroseismology and globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Asteroseismic investigations of solar-like oscillations in giant stars enable the derivation of their masses and radii. For mono-age mono-metallicity populations of stars this allows the integrated red giant branch (RGB) mass loss to be estimated by comparing the median mass of the low-luminosity RGB stars to that of the helium-core-burning stars (HeCB). Aims. We aim to exploit quasi mono-age mono-metallicity populations of field stars in the $\alpha$-rich sequence of the Milky Way (MW) to derive the integrated mass loss and its dependence on metallicity. By comparing to metal-rich globular clusters (GCs), we wish to determine whether the RGB mass loss differs in the two environments. Methods. Catalogues of asteroseismic parameters based on time-series photometry from the Kepler and K2 missions cross-matched to spectroscopic information from APOGEE-DR17, photometry from 2MASS, parallaxes from Gaia DR3 and reddening maps are utilised. The RGB mass loss is determined by comparing mass distributions of RGB and HeCB stars in three metallicity bins. For two GCs, the mass loss is derived from colour-magnitude diagrams. Results. Integrated RGB mass loss is found to increase with decreasing metallicity and/or mass in the [Fe/H] range from -0.9 to +0.0. At [Fe/H]=-0.50 the RGB mass loss of MW $\alpha$-rich field stars is compatible with that in GCs of the same metallicity. Conclusions. We provide novel empirical determinations of the integrated mass loss connecting field stars and GC stars at comparable metallicities. These show that mass loss cannot be accurately described by a Reimers mass-loss law with a single value of $\eta$. This should encourage further theoretical developments aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the processes involved in mass loss.</description>

      <title>Shear-driven magnetic buoyancy in the solar tachocline: Dependence of the mean electromotive force on diffusivity and latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The details of the dynamo process that is responsible for driving the solar magnetic activity cycle are still not fully understood. In particular, whilst differential rotation provides a plausible mechanism for the regeneration of the toroidal (azimuthal) component of the large-scale magnetic field, there is ongoing debate regarding the process that is responsible for regenerating the Sun's large-scale poloidal field. Our aim is to demonstrate that magnetic buoyancy, in the presence of rotation, is capable of producing the necessary regenerative effect. Building upon our previous work, we carry out numerical simulations of a local Cartesian model of the tachocline, consisting of a rotating, fully compressible, electrically conducting fluid with a forced shear flow. An initially weak, vertical magnetic field is sheared into a strong, horizontal magnetic layer that becomes subject to magnetic buoyancy instability. By increasing the Prandtl number we lessen the back reaction of the Lorentz force onto the shear flow, maintaining stronger shear and a more intense magnetic layer. This in turn leads to a more vigorous instability and a much stronger mean electromotive force, which has the potential to significantly influence the evolution of the mean magnetic field. These results are only weakly dependent upon the inclination of the rotation vector, i.e. the latitude of the local Cartesian model. Although further work is needed to confirm this, these results suggest that magnetic buoyancy in the tachocline is a viable poloidal field regeneration mechanism for the solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Particle Events and Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) and radio bursts are indicators of particle acceleration on the Sun and in the heliosphere. The accelerated particles have energies significantly higher than thermal particles up to several orders of magnitude. SEPs are detected directly by particle detectors on Earth and in space. Understanding SEPs is important from both science and application points of view because they are poorly understood and present space weather hazard to humans and their technology in space. SEPs accompany energetic flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and intense radio bursts, which help us understand particle properties such as intensity, spectra, and time evolution. This paper summarizes how SEP properties are closely related to solar eruptions and the associated solar radio bursts.</description>

      <title>The evolutionary history of GD1400, a white dwarf-brown dwarf binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GD1400AB was one of the first known white dwarf$+$brown dwarf binaries, and is the only one of these systems where the white dwarf is a ZZ Ceti pulsator. Here we present both radial velocity measurements and time series photometry, analysing both the white dwarf pulsations and the effects of irradiation on the brown dwarf. We find the brightness temperatures of 1760$/pm$10 K for the night side and 1860$/pm$10 K for the day side indicate the brown dwarf is hotter than spectra have previously suggested, although brightness temperatures calculated using a larger radius for the brown dwarf are consistent with previously determined spectral types. We also discuss the likely evolutionary pathway of this binary, and put its common envelope phase into context with the other known systems.</description>

      <title>TESS detections of pulsations in Of?p stars in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used TESS observations to search for pulsations in six known Of?p stars in the Magellanic Clouds. We find evidence for pulsational variability in three Of?p stars: UCAC4 115-008604, OGLE SMC-SC6 237339, and AzV 220. Two of them, UCAC4 115-008604 and OGLE SMC-SC6 237339, have been reported to possess kG-order magnetic fields. The obtained results are important to constrain and improve stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>The variability of Betelgeuse explained by surface convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant (RSG) that is known to vary semi-regularly on both short and long timescales. The origin of the short period of Betelgeuse has often been associated to radial pulsations but could also be due to the convection motions present at the surface of RSGs. Aims. We investigate the link between surface activity and the variability of the star. Methods. Linear polarization in Betelgeuse is a proxy of convection which is unrelated to pulsations. Using 10 years of spectropolarimetric data of Betelgeuse, we seek for periodicities in the least-squares deconvolution profiles of Stokes I, Q, U and the total linear polarization using Lomb-Scargle periodograms. Results. We find similar periods in linear polarization signals than in photometric variability. The 400 d period is too close to a peak of the window function of our data. But the two periods of 330 d and 200 d are present in the periodogram of Stokes Q and U, showing that the variability of Betelgeuse can be interpreted as due to surface convection. Conclusions. Since linear polarization in the spectrum of Betelgeuse is not known to vary with pulsations, but is linked to surface convection, and since similar periods are found in time series of photometric measurements and spectropolarimetry, we conclude that the photometric variability is due to the surface convective structures, and not to any pulsation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>BD+44 493: Chemo-Dynamical Analysis and Constraints on Companion Planetary Masses from WIYN/NEID Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present high-resolution (R~100,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N~800) spectroscopic observations for the well-known, bright, extremely metal-poor, carbon-enhanced star BD+44 493. We determined chemical abundances and upper limits for 17 elements from WIYN/NEID data, complemented with 11 abundances re-determined from Subaru and Hubble data, using the new, more accurate, stellar atmospheric parameters calculated in this work. Our analysis suggests that BD+44 493 is a low-mass (0.83Msun) old (12.1-13.2Gyr) second-generation star likely formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single metal-free 20.5Msun Population III star in the early Universe. With a disk-like orbit, BD+44 493 does not appear to be associated with any major merger event in the early history of the Milky Way. From the precision radial-velocity NEID measurements (median absolute deviation - MAD=16m/s), we were able to constrain companion planetary masses around BD+44 493 and rule out the presence of planets as small as msin(i)=2MJ out to periods of 100 days. This study opens a new avenue of exploration for the intersection between stellar archaeology and exoplanet science using NEID.</description>

      <title>Revised Point-Spread Functions for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present revised point-spread functions (PSFs) for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). These PSFs provide a robust estimate of the light diffracted by the meshes holding the entrance and focal plane filters and the light that is diffusely scattered over medium- to long-distance by the micro-roughness of the mirrors. We first calibrate the diffracted light using flare images. Our modeling of the diffracted light provides reliable determinations of the mesh parameters and finds that about 24 to 33% of the collected light is diffracted, depending on the AIA channel. Then, we fit for the diffuse scattered light using partially lunar occulted images. We find that the diffuse scattered light can be modeled as a superposition of two power law functions that scatter light over the entire length of the detector. The amount of diffuse scattered light ranges from 10 to 35 %, depending on the AIA channel. In total, AIA diffracts and scatters about 40 to 60 % of the collected light over medium to long distances. When correcting for this, bright image regions increase in intensity by about 30 %, dark image regions decrease in intensity by up to 90 %, and the associated differential emission measure analysis of solar features are affected accordingly. Finally, we compare the image reconstructions using our new PSFs to those using the AIA team PSFs and the PSFs of Poduval et al. (2013). We find that our PSFs outperform the others; our PSFs correct well for the flare diffraction pattern and predict accurately the long-distance scattered light in lunar occultations.</description>

Abstract: In this third installment of SETI in 20xx, we very briefly and subjectively review developments in SETI in 2022. Our primary focus is 80 papers and books published or made public in 2022, which we sort into six broad categories: results from actual searches, new search methods and instrumentation, target and frequency selection, the development of technosignatures, theory of ETIs, and social aspects of SETI.</description>

      <title>Eridanus III and DELVE 1: Carbon-rich Primordial Star Clusters or the Smallest Dwarf Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectroscopy of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellites Eridanus III (Eri III) and DELVE 1. We identify eight member stars in each satellite and place non-constraining upper limits on their velocity and metallicity dispersions. The brightest star in each object is very metal-poor, at [Fe/H] = -3.1 for Eri III and [Fe/H] = -2.8 for DELVE 1. Both of these stars exhibit large overabundances of carbon and very low abundances of the neutron-capture elements Ba and Sr, and we classify them as CEMP-no stars. Because their metallicities are well below those of the Milky Way globular cluster population, and because no CEMP-no stars have been identified in globular clusters, these chemical abundances could suggest that Eri III and DELVE 1 are dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, the two systems have half-light radii of 8 pc and 6 pc, respectively, which is more compact than any known ultra-faint dwarfs. We conclude that Eri III and DELVE 1 are either the smallest dwarf galaxies yet discovered, or they are representatives of a new class of star clusters that underwent chemical evolution distinct from that of ordinary globular clusters. In the latter scenario, such objects are likely the most primordial star clusters surviving today. These possibilities can be distinguished by future measurements of carbon and/or iron abundances for larger samples of stars or improved stellar kinematics for the two systems.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric escape in hot Jupiters under sub-Alfv\'enic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters might reside inside the Alfv\'en surface of their host star wind, where the stellar wind is dominated by magnetic energy. The implications of such a sub-Alfv\'enic environment for atmospheric escape are not fully understood. Here, we employ 3-D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations and Lyman-$\alpha$ transit calculations to investigate atmospheric escape properties of magnetised hot Jupiters. By varying the planetary magnetic field strength ($B_p$) and obliquity, we find that the structure of the outflowing atmosphere transitions from a magnetically unconfined regime, where a tail of material streams from the nightside of the planet, to a magnetically confined regime, where material escapes through the polar regions. Notably, we find an increase in the planet escape rate with $B_p$ in both regimes, with a local decrease when the planet transitions from the unconfined to the confined regime. Contrary to super-Alfv\'enic interactions, which predicted two polar outflows from the planet, our sub-Alfv\'enic models show only one significant polar outflow. In the opposing pole, the planetary field lines connect to the star. Finally, our synthetic Ly-$\alpha$ transits show that both the red-wing and blue-wing absorptions increase with $B_p$. Furthermore, there is a degeneracy between $B_p$ and the stellar wind mass-loss rate when considering absorption of individual Lyman-$\alpha$ wings. This degeneracy can be broken by considering the ratio between the blue-wing and the red-wing absorptions, as stronger stellar winds result in higher blue-to-red absorption ratios. We show that, by using the absorption ratios, Lyman-$\alpha$ transits can probe stellar wind properties and exoplanetary magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the continuum radiative transfer problem inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the continuum radiative transfer problem inside circumstellar envelopes is both a theoretical and numerical challenge, especially in the frequency-dependent and multi-dimensional case. While approximate methods are easier to handle numerically, they often fail to accurately describe the radiation field inside complex geometries. For these cases, it is necessary to directly solve numerically the radiative transfer equation. We investigate the accuracy of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM hereafter) applied to the frequency-dependent two dimensional radiative transfer equation, coupled with the radiative equilibrium equation, inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. The DGFEM is a variant of finite element methods. It employs discontinuous elements and flux integrals along their boundaries, ensuring local conservation. However, as opposed to the classical finite-element methods, the solution is discontinuous across element edges. We implemented the method in a code and tested its accuracy by comparing our results with the benchmarks from the literature. For all the tested cases, the temperature profile agrees within one percent. Additionally, the emerging spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images, obtained subsequently by ray-tracing techniques from the DGFEM solution, agree on average within $5~\mathrm{\%}$ and $10~\mathrm{\%}$, respectively. We show that the DGFEM can accurately describe the temperature profile inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. Consecutively the emerging SEDs and images are also well reproduced. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method provides an alternative method (other than Monte Carlo methods for instance) for solving the radiative transfer equation, and could be used in cases that are more difficult to handle with the other methods.</description>

Abstract: Learning about the chemical evolution of the universe is crucial to understanding the formation of the first stars and structure formation in the early universe. To find out how elements are produced via nucleosynthesis and how their relative amounts have evolved with time, abundance trends of stars with different metallicities can be established and compared. In this study, we present a spectrum of a very metal-poor star, HE 2315$-$4240, with [Fe/H] = $-$2.89 based on a Magellan/MIKE high-resolution visual light spectrum. The star has a radial velocity of +41.9 km s$^{-1}$, an effective temperature of 5181 K, a surface gravity of 2.24 dex, and a microturbulence of 1.61 km s$^{-1}$. The $\alpha$-elements and the iron peak elements agree well with the abundance trend. The low abundance of [Sr/Ba] and [C/Fe] suggests that HE 2315$-$4240 is accreted and formed in a dwarf galaxy. The value of [Ba/Eu] suggests the operation of a limited r-process. The abundance pattern of [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] in HE 2315$-$4240 and its metallicity indicated that the star is formed from the gas enriched by a Type II supernova of a massive Pop III star. The abundance pattern fits Population III supernova yields moderately. The star's kinematic behavior shows that the star has a retrograde orbit and is moving away from the galactic center and out of the galactic disk to the south, and although the star is located in the halo of the Milky Way, it didn't form in the Milky Way but was rather formed in a small dwarf galaxy that was later absorbed by the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>A network of cooler white dwarfs as infrared standards for flux calibration</title>

Abstract: The accurate flux calibration of observational data is vital for astrophysics and cosmology because absolute flux uncertainties of stellar standards propagate into scientific results. With the ever higher precision achieved by telescopic missions (e.g. JWST) in the infrared (IR), suitable calibrators are required for this regime. The basis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) flux scale is defined by model fits of three hot (Teff &gt; 30000 K) hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs, which achieve an accuracy better than 1 per cent at optical wavelengths but falls below this level in the IR range. We present a network of 17 cooler DA white dwarfs with Teff &lt; 20000 K as spectrophotometric flux standards that are equally, if not more, accurate at IR wavelengths. Cooler white dwarfs do not suffer from non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) effects in continuum flux or from UV metal line blanketing, have a larger sky density, are generally closer to Earth with little or negligible interstellar reddening, and have energy distributions peaking in the optical or near-IR. Using the latest grid of DA LTE atmosphere models with three-dimensional (3D) convection, the observed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS) and Wide Field Camera three (WFC3) fluxes of our network are accurate to 3 per cent over most of the range 1450 - 16000 AA, with a median standard deviation of 1.41 per cent. Fitting the HST STIS and WFC3 white dwarf SEDs and Balmer lines independently yields SEDs that agree within 3$\sigma$, which demonstrates the precision of the models for our network.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Prescriptions for Parameterized Water Cloud Formation on Ultra-cool Substellar Objects</title>

Abstract: Water must condense into ice clouds in the coldest brown dwarfs and exoplanets. When they form, these icy clouds change the emergent spectra, temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds and compare their properties with those from the widely-used EddySed cloud model (Ackerman &amp; Marley 2001) for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base. Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable $f_{sed}$ parameter allows spectra generated from the parameterized Eddysed model to better match those of the microphysical CARMA model. This work provides recommendations for efficiently generating microphysically-informed water clouds for future models of cold substellar objects with H/He atmospheres.</description>
