      <title>On the Boundedness of Generalized Fractional Integral Operators in Morrey Spaces and Camapanato Spaces associated with the Dunkl Operator on the Real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the Dunkl-type fractional integral operator $I_\beta$ $(0 &lt; \beta &lt; 2\alpha + 2 =d_\alpha)$ is bounded from $L^p(\R,d\mu_\alpha)$ to $L^q (\R, d\mu_\alpha)$ when $1 &lt; p &lt; \frac{d_\alpha}{\beta}$ and $\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{q} = \frac{\beta}{d_\alpha}$. In \cite{spsa} , the authors introduced the generalized Dunkl-type fractional integral operator $T_\rho^\alpha$ and it's modified version $\tilde{T}_\rho^\alpha$ and extended the above boundedness results to the generalized Dunkl-type Morrey spaces and Dunkl-type $BMO_\phi$ spaces. In this paper we investigate the boundedness of generalized Dunkl-type fractional integral operators and it's modified version mainly on the Dunkl-type Campanato space.</description>

      <title>Band-dominated and Fourier-band-dominated operators on locally compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By relating notions from quantum harmonic analysis and band-dominated operator theory, we prove that over any locally compact abelian group $G$, the operator algebra $\mathcal C_1$ from quantum harmonic analysis agrees with the intersection of band-dominated operators and Fourier band-dominated operators. As an application, we characterize the compactness of operators acting on $L^2(G)$ and compare it with previous results in the discrete case. In particular, our results can be seen as a generalization of the limit operator concept to the non-discrete world. Moreover, we briefly discuss property $A'$ for arbitrary locally compact abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Density of irreducible operators in the trace-class norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1968, Paul Halmos initiated the research on density of the set of irreducible operators on a separable Hilbert space. Through the research, a long-standing unsolved problem inquires: is the set of irreducible operators dense in $B(H)$ with respect to the trace-class norm topology? Precisely, for each operator $T $ in $B(H)$ and every $\varepsilon &gt;0$, is there a trace-class operator $K$ such that $T+K$ is irreducible and $\Vert K \Vert_1 &lt; \varepsilon$?
  For $p&gt;1$, to prove the $\Vert \cdot \Vert_p$-norm density of irreducible operators in $B(H)$, a type of Weyl-von Neumann theorem effects as a key technique. But the traditional method fails for the case $p=1$, where by $\Vert \cdot \Vert_p$-norm we denote the Schatten $p$-norm.
  In the current paper, for a large family of operators in $B(H)$, we give the above long-term problem an affirmative answer. The result is derived from a combination of techniques in both operator theory and operator algebras. Moreover, we discover that there is a strong connection between the problem and another related operator-theoretical problem related to type $\mathrm{II}_1$ von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of a Hessian-free inequality and Lipschitz continuous Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that if a twice differentiable function has a Lipschitz continuous Hessian, then its gradients satisfy a Jensen-type inequality. In particular, this inequality is Hessian-free in the sense that the Hessian does not actually appear in the inequality. In this paper, we show that the converse holds in a generalized setting: if a continuos function from a Hilbert space to a reflexive Banach space satisfies such an inequality, then it is Fr\'echet differentiable and its derivative is Lipschitz continuous. Our proof relies on the Baillon-Haddad theorem.</description>

      <title>Auerbach bases, projection constants, and the joint spectral radius of principal submatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that compact sets of complex matrices can always be brought, via similarity transformation, into a form where all matrix entries are bounded in absolute value by the joint spectral radius (JSR). The key tool for this is that every extremal norm of a matrix set admits an Auerbach basis; any such basis gives rise to a desired coordinate system. An immediate implication is that all diagonal entries - equivalently, all one-dimensional principal submatrices - are uniformly bounded above by the JSR. It is shown that the corresponding bounding property does not hold for higher dimensional principal submatrices. More precisely, we construct finite matrix sets for which, across the entire similarity orbit, the JSRs of all higher-dimensional principal submatrices exceed that of the original set. This shows that the bounding result does not extend to submatrices of dimension greater than one. The constructions rely on tools from the geometry of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, with projection constants of norms playing a key role. Additional bounds of the JSR of principal submatrices are obtained using John's ellipsoidal approximation and known estimates for projection constants.</description>

      <title>On the weak-fragmentability index of some Lipschitz-free spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of Lipschitz-free spaces verifying the Point of Continuity Property with arbitrarily high weak-fragmentability index. For this purpose, we use a generalized construction of the countably branching diamond graphs. As a consequence, we deduce that to be Lipschitz-universal for countable complete metric spaces, a separable complete metric space cannot be purely 1-unrectifiable. Another corollary is the existence of an uncountable family of pairwise non-isomorphic Lipschitz-free spaces over purely 1-unrectifiable metric spaces. Some results on compact reduction are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Composition Operators on the Little Lipschitz space of a rooted tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the composition operators on the little Lipschitz space ${\mathcal L}_0$ of a rooted tree $T$, defined as the subspace of the Lipschitz space ${\mathcal L}$ consisting of the complex-valued functions $f$ on $T$ such that $$\lim_{|v|\to\infty}|f(v)-f(v^-)|=0,$$ where $v^-$ is the vertex adjacent to the vertex $v$ in the path from the root to $v$ and $|v|$ denotes the number of edges from the root to $v$. Specifically, we give a complete characterization of the self-maps $\phi$ of $T$ for which the composition operator $C_\phi$ is bounded and we estimate its operator norm. In addition, we study the spectrum of $C_\phi$ and the hypercyclicity of the operators $\lambda C_\phi$ for $\lambda \in {\mathbb C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct canonical $p$-energy measures associated with strongly local $p$-energy forms without any assumptions of self-similarity, where $p$-energy forms are $L^p$-versions of Dirichlet forms, which have recently been studied mainly on fractals. Furthermore, we prove that the measures satisfy the chain and Leibniz rules, and that such a "good" energy measures are unique. As an application, we also prove the $p$-energy version of Mosco's domination principle. Moreover, we show a Korevaar--Schoen-type $p$-energies defined by Alonso-Ruiz and Baudoin coincide with our energy measures.</description>

      <title>Semigroups of self-similar actions and higher rank Baumslag-Solitar semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of higher rank Baumslag-Solitar semigroups and their related C*-algebras. We focus on two extreme, but interesting, classes - one is related to products of odometers and the other is related to Furstenberg's $\times p,, \times q$ conjecture. For the former class, whose C*-algebras are studied by H. Li and the second author, we here characterize the factoriality of the associated von Neumann algebras and further determine their types; for the latter, we obtain their canonical Cartan subalgebras. In the rank 1 case, we study a more general setting which encompasses (single-vertex) generalized Baumslag-Solitar semigroups. One of our main tools is from self-similar higher rank graphs and their C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>The tempered disk and the tempered cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-archimedean valuation ring V (K its fraction field, in mixed characteristic): inspired by some views presented by Scholze, we introduce a new point of view on the non-archimedean analytic setting in terms of derived analytic geometry (then associating a "spectrum" to each ind-Banach algebra). We want to look at the behaviour of this spectrum from a differential point of view. In such a spectrum, for example, there exist open subsets having functions with log-growth as sections for the structural sheaf. In this framework, a transfer theorem for the log-growth of solutions of p-adic differential equations can be interpreted as a continuity theorem (analogue to the transfer theorem for their radii of convergence in the Berkovich spaces). As a dividend of such a theory, we define a new cohomology theory in terms of the Hodge-completed derived de Rham cohomology of the ind-Banach derived analytic space associated to a smooth k-scheme, X_k (k residual field of V), via the use of "tempered tubes".
  We finally compare our tempered de Rham cohomology with crystalline cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise absolutely dilatable completely positive maps on the space of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are also bimodular over a given von Neumann algebra as rotations by a suitable unitary on a larger Hilbert space followed by slicing along the trace of an additional ancilla. We define the local, quantum and approximately quantum types of absolutely dilatable maps, according to the type of the admissible ancilla. We show that the local absolutely dilatable maps admit an exact factorisation through an abelian ancilla and show that they are limits in the point weak* topology of conjugations by unitaries in the commutant of the given von Neumann algebra. We show that the Connes Embedding Problem is equivalent to deciding if all absolutely dilatable maps are approximately quantum.</description>

      <title>Higher order error estimates for regularization of inverse problems under non-additive noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we derive higher order error estimates for inverse problems distorted by non-additive noise, in terms of Bregman distances. The results are obtained by means of a novel source condition, inspired by the dual problem. Specifically, we focus on variational regularization having the Kullback-Leibler divergence as data-fidelity, and a convex penalty term. In this framework, we provide an interpretation of the new source condition, and present error estimates also when a variational formulation of the source condition is employed. We show that this approach can be extended to variational regularization that incorporates more general convex data fidelities.</description>

      <title>A note on Arveson's hyperrigidity and non-degenerate C*-correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the results of Kim, and of Katsoulis and Ramsey concerning hyperrigidity for non-degenerate C*-correspondences. We show that the tensor algebra is hyperrigid, if and only if Katsura's ideal acts non-degenerately, if and only if Katsura's ideal acts non-degenerately under any representation. This gives a positive answer to the question of Katsoulis and Ramsey, showing that their necessary condition and their sufficient condition for hyperrigidity of the tensor algebra are equivalent. Non-degeneracy of the left action of Katsura's ideal was also shown by Kim to be equivalent to hyperrigidity for the selfadjoint operator space associated with the C*-correspondence, and our approach provides a simplified proof of this result as well. In the process we revisit Arveson's criterion connecting maximality with the unique extension property and hyperrigidity, in conjunction with the work of Salomon on generating sets.</description>

      <title>Quasitubal Tensor Algebra Over Separable Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tubal tensor framework provides a clean and effective algebraic setting for tensor computations, supporting matrix-mimetic features like Singular Value Decomposition and Eckart-Young-like optimality results. Underlying the tubal tensor framework is a view of a tensor as a matrix of finite sized tubes. In this work, we lay the mathematical and computational foundations for working with tensors with infinite size tubes: matrices whose elements are elements from a separable Hilbert space. A key challenge is that existence of important desired matrix-mimetic features of tubal tensors rely on the existence of a unit element in the ring of tubes. Such unit element cannot exist for tubes which are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We sidestep this issue by embedding the tubal space in a commutative unital C*-algebra of bounded operators. The resulting quasitubal algebra recovers the structural properties needed for decomposition and low-rank approximation. In addition to laying the theoretical groundwork for working with tubal tensors with infinite dimensional tubes, we discuss computational aspects of our construction, and provide a numerical illustration where we compute a finite dimensional approximation to a infinitely-sized synthetic tensor using our theory. We believe our theory opens new exciting avenues for applying matrix mimetic tensor framework in the context of inherently infinite dimensional problems.</description>
