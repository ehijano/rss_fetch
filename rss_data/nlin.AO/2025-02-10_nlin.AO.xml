      <title>Harnessing omnipresent oscillator networks as computational resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory behavior. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This reservoir computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. This work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence and evolution of information handling is essential for unraveling the origins of life. Traditional genetic-first and metabolism-first models fall short in explaining how instructional information control systems naturally arise from molecular dynamics. To address this gap, we adopt an information-first approach, integrating Hofmeyr's (F, A)-systems -- an extension of Rosen's (M, R)-systems -- with temporal parametrization and multiscale causality. These models, which embody closure to efficient causation while remaining open to formal causation, provide a robust framework for primitive autopoiesis, anticipation, and adaptation. We establish a formal equivalence between extended (F, A)-systems and communicating X-machines, resolving self-referential challenges and demonstrating the hypercomputational nature of life processes. Our stepwise model traces the evolution of information handling from simple reaction networks that recognize regular languages to self-replicating chemical systems with memory and anticipatory capabilities. This transition from analog to digital architectures enhances evolutionary robustness and aligns with experimental evidence suggesting that chemical computation does not require life-specific chemistry. Furthermore, we incorporate open-ended evolutionary dynamics driven by computational undecidability and irreducibility, reinforcing the necessity of unconventional computing frameworks. This computational enactivist perspective provides a cohesive theoretical basis for a recently proposed trialectic between autopoiesis, anticipation and adaptation in order to solve the problem of relevance. By highlighting the critical role of hypercomputational processes in life's emergence and evolution, our framework offers new insights into the fundamental principles underlying biological information processing.</description>

      <title>Predicting Steady-State Behavior in Complex Networks with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In complex systems, information propagation can be defined as diffused or delocalized, weakly localized, and strongly localized. This study investigates the application of graph neural network models to learn the behavior of a linear dynamical system on networks. A graph convolution and attention-based neural network framework has been developed to identify the steady-state behavior of the linear dynamical system. We reveal that our trained model distinguishes the different states with high accuracy. Furthermore, we have evaluated model performance with real-world data. In addition, to understand the explainability of our model, we provide an analytical derivation for the forward and backward propagation of our framework.</description>
