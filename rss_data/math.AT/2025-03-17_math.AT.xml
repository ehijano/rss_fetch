      <title>Positive Scalar Curvature and crystallographic fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine positive and negative results for the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg Conjecture within the class of crystallographic groups. We give necessary conditions within the class of split extensions of free abelian by cyclic groups to satisfy the unstable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg Conjecture. We also give necessary conditions within the same class of groups, producing an infinite number of counterexamples for the conjecture.</description>

      <title>The \'{e}tale sectional number is either 1 or infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the \'{e}tale sectional number (\text{\'{E}tale-sec$(-)$}), i.e., the sectional number in the category of topological spaces with the \'{e}tale quasi Grothendieck topology (as defined in arXiv:2410.22515), is either 1 or infinity. Specifically, given a continuous map $f:X\to Y$, we demonstrate that \[\text{\'{E}tale-sec$(f)$}=\begin{cases}
  1,&amp;\hbox{ if $f$ is locally sectionable,}
  \infty,&amp;\hbox{ if $f$ is not locally sectionable.}
  \end{cases} \] Additionally, for a path-connected space $X$, the \'{e}tale topological complexity satisfies \[\text{TC}_{\text{\'{e}tale}}(X)=\begin{cases}
  1,&amp;\hbox{ if $X$ is locally contractible,}
  \infty,&amp;\hbox{ if $X$ is not locally contractible.}
  \end{cases} \] These results provide a way to understand the \aspas{complexity} of maps and spaces within the context of the \'{e}tale quasi Grothendieck topology, a structure that considers local behavior of maps and spaces. The classification into values of 1 or infinity reflects a dichotomy in the local geometric structure of the map or space, with the presence or absence of local sections or contractibility significantly influencing the outcome.</description>

      <title>Torsion in Magnitude homology theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the structure and relationships between magnitude homology and Eulerian magnitude homology of finite graphs. Building on the work of Kaneta and Yoshinaga, Sazdanovic and Summers, and Asao and Izumihara, we provide two proofs of the existence of torsion in Eulerian magnitude homology, offer insights into the types and orders of torsion, and present explicit computations for various classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Tate-valued Characteristic Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a projective variant of classical complex orientation theory. Using this, we construct a map of spectra which lifts the total Chern class, providing an alternative answer to an old question of Segal \cite{segal}, previously answered by Lawson et al \cite{lawsonetal}. We also lift and generalize the ``sharp'' construction of Ando-French-Ganter \cite{afg} to an operation on arbitrary $\EE_\infty$-complex orientations, thereby providing a rich source of new $\EE_\infty$-orientations for commutative ring spectra. In particular we give an $\EE_\infty$-lift of the Jacobi orientation, a generalization of the much-studied two variable elliptic genus. Finally, we construct some new complex orientations of periodic ring spectra as requested in \cite{hahnyuan}.</description>

Abstract: We reconstruct (appropriately completed) categories of cellular motivic spectra over fields of small cohomological dimension in terms of only their absolute Galois groups. As our main application, we determine the motivic stable stems (away from the characteristic) of almost all fields.</description>

      <title>The topology of simple games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of simple games from the point of view of combinatorial topology. The starting premise is that the losing coalitions of a simple game can be identified with a simplicial complex. Various topological constructions and results from the theory of simplicial complexes then carry over to the setting of simple games. Examples are cone, join, and the Alexander dual, each of which have interpretations as familiar game-theoretic objects. We also provide some new topological results about simple games, most notably in applications of homology of simplicial complexes to weighted simple games. The exposition is introductory and largely self-contained, intended to inspire further work and point to what appears to be a wealth of potentially fruitful directions of investigation bridging game theory and topology.</description>

      <title>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $\Omega$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L\"{u}ck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian homology and homotopy colimit of classifying spaces for a diagram of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper considers non-Abelian homology groups for a diagram of groups introduced as homotopy groups of a simplicial replacement. It is proved that the non-Abelian homology groups of the group diagram are isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the homotopy colimit of the diagram of classifying spaces, with a dimension shift of 1. As an application, a method is developed for finding a nonzero homotopy group of least dimension for a homotopy colimit of classifying spaces. For a group diagram over a free category with a zero colimit, a criterion for the isomorphism of the first non-Abelian and first Abelian homology groups is obtained. It is established that the non-Abelian homology groups are isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of the colimit functor defined on the category of group diagrams.</description>

      <title>Higher holonomy for curved L${}_\infty$-algebras 1: simplicial methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a natural morphism $\rho$ from the nerve $\text{MC}_\bullet(L) = \text{MC}(\Omega_\bullet \widehat{\otimes} L)$ of a pronilpotent curved L${}_\infty$-algebra $L$ to the simplicial subset $\gamma_\bullet(L) = \text{MC}(\Omega_\bullet \widehat{\otimes} L,s_\bullet)$ of Maurer--Cartan element satisfying the Dupont gauge condition. This morphism equals the identity on the image of the inclusion $\gamma_\bullet(L) \hookrightarrow \text{MC}_\bullet(L)$. The proof uses the extension of Berglund's homotopical perturbation theory for L${}_\infty$-algebras to curved L${}_\infty$-algebras. The morphism $\rho$ equals the holonomy for nilpotent Lie algebras. In a sequel to this paper, we use a cubical analogue $\rho^\square$ of $\rho$ to identify $\rho$ with higher holonomy for semiabelian curved \Linf-algebras.</description>

      <title>Lifting category, Sectional category, Homotopic distance, All at once</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The `sectional category' of a map has been studied in two ways: on the one hand with open covers, and on the other hand with Ganea and Whitehead style constructions. For these approaches to be equivalent, the normality of the codomain is necessary. We show that this is the only condition. The `Lusternik-Schnirelmann category' of a space, as well as Farber's `topological complexity', are particular cases of sectional categories. In addition, Mac\'ias-Virg\'os and Mosquera-Lois introduced the notion of `homotopic distance' between two maps, showing that it is a distance on the homotopy class of maps with same domain and codomain provided the domain is normal. We introduce the notion of `lifting category' which unifies the notions of sectional category, topological complexity, and homotopic distance, all these notions being special cases of lifting category. A special attention is also paid to the difference between the pointed and unpointed cases.</description>

      <title>Steinhaus Filtration and Stable Paths in the Mapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.08256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new filtration called the Steinhaus filtration built from a single cover based on a generalized Steinhaus distance, a generalization of Jaccard distance. The homology persistence module of a Steinhaus filtration with infinitely many cover elements may not be $q$-tame, even when the covers are in a totally bounded space. While this may pose a challenge to derive stability results, we show that the Steinhaus filtration is stable when the cover is finite. We show that while the \v{C}ech and Steinhaus filtrations are not isomorphic in general, they are isomorphic for a finite point set in dimension one. Furthermore, the VR filtration completely determines the $1$-skeleton of the Steinhaus filtration in arbitrary dimension.
  We then develop a language and theory for stable paths within the Steinhaus filtration. We demonstrate how the framework can be applied to several applications where a standard metric may not be defined but a cover is readily available. We introduce a new perspective for modeling recommendation system datasets. As an example, we look at a movies dataset and we find the stable paths identified in our framework represent a sequence of movies constituting a gentle transition and ordering from one genre to another.
  For explainable machine learning, we apply the Mapper algorithm for model induction by building a filtration from a single Mapper complex, and provide explanations in the form of stable paths between subpopulations. For illustration, we build a Mapper complex from a supervised machine learning model trained on the FashionMNIST dataset. Stable paths in the Steinhaus filtration provide improved explanations of relationships between subpopulations of images.</description>

      <title>Proper morphisms of $\infty$-topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise proper morphisms of $\infty$-topoi in terms of a relativised notion of compactness: we show that a geometric morphism of $\infty$-topoi is proper if and only if it commutes with colimits indexed by filtered internal $\infty$-categories in the target. In particular, our result implies that for any $\infty$-topos, the global sections functor is proper if and only if it preserves filtered colimits. As an application, we show that every proper and separated map of topological spaces gives rise to a proper morphism between the associated sheaf $\infty$-topoi, generalising a result of Lurie. Along the way, we develop some aspects of the theory of localic higher topoi internal to an $\infty$-topos, which might be of independent interest.</description>
