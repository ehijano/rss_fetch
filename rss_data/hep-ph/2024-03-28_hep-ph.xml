      <title>Prospects for PIONEER</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pion $\beta$ decay, $\pi^+ \to\pi^0 e^+ \nu_e$, offers a pristine way to measure the CKM matrix element $V_{ud}$ in a purely mesonic system, with excellent control over the hadronic matrix elements. We review the physics goals and current status of the PIONEER experiment, which aims at major improvements in the branching fractions for the $\pi^+\to e^+ \nu_e$ decay in Phase I and for pion $\beta$ decay in Phases II and III of its experimental program, potentially leading to a measurement of $V_{ud}$ competitive with determinations from $\beta$ decays involving nucleons.</description>

      <title>Feedback in the dark: a critical examination of CMB bounds on primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If present in the early universe, primordial black holes (PBHs) will accrete matter and emit high-energy photons, altering the statistical properties of the {Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)}. This mechanism has been used to constrain the fraction of dark matter that is in the form of PBHs to be much smaller than unity for PBH masses well above one solar mass. Moreover, the presence of dense dark matter mini-halos around the PBHs has been used to set even more stringent constraints, as these would boost the accretion rates. In this work, we critically revisit CMB constraints on PBHs taking into account the role of the local ionization of the gas around them. We discuss how the local increase in temperature around PBHs can prevent the dark matter mini-halos from strongly enhancing the accretion process, in some cases significantly weakening previously derived CMB constraints. We explore in detail the key ingredients of the CMB bound and derive a conservative limit on the cosmological abundance of massive PBHs.</description>

      <title>Stau pairs from natural SUSY at high luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural supersymmetry (SUSY) with light higgsinos is perhaps the most plausible of all weak scale SUSY models while a variety of motivations point to (right) tau sleptons as the lightest of all the sleptons. We examine a SUSY model line with rather light right-staus embedded within natural SUSY. For light stau_1 of a few hundred GeV, then the decays stau_1 -&gt; \tau\tchi_{1,2}^0 and \nu_\tau\tchi_1^- occur at comparable rates where the (higgsino-like) \tchi_1^\pm and \tchi_2^0 release only small visible energy: in this case, the expected \tau^+\tau^- +\eslt signature is diminished from usual expectations due to the presence of the nearly invisible decay mode \ttau_1 -&gt; \nu_\tau\tchi_1^-. However, once m_{\ttau_1}&gt; ~m(bino), then decays to binos such as \ttau_1 -&gt; \tau\tchi_3^0 open up where \tchi_3^0 decays to higgsinos plus W^\pm, Z^0 and h at comparable rates. For these heavier staus, then stau pair production gives rise to diboson+\eslt events which may contain 0, 1 or 2 additional hard \tau leptons. From these considerations, we examine the potential for future discovery of tau-slepton pair production at high-luminosity LHC. While we do not find a 5\sigma HL-LHC discovery reach for 3000 fb^{-1}, we do find a 95\% CL exclusion reach, ranging between m_{\ttau_1}:100-450 GeV for m_{\tchi_1^0}~ 100 GeV. This latter reach disappears for m_{\tchi_1^0}&gt;~ 200 GeV.</description>

      <title>Analysis of data on $B$ decays into two light vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important experimental effort has been accomplished in recent years in the measurement of rates, polarization and CP observables in $B$ decays into two light vector mesons. On the theoretical side, after a very consistent effort done within the framework of QCD Factorization, the comparison of the theory with the present experimental data has not been updated, to our knowledge. In the present paper we compare this wealth of data to the theory, in tree color-allowed, tree color-suppressed and pure penguin decays, and present predictions for the observables that have not yet been measured in these decays. In our fits we find acceptable values of $\chi^2$ for the branching ratios and for the direct CP asymmetries. However, this is not the case for the longitudinal polarization fractions, essentially due to disagreement between theory and experiment for the modes $B_{d,s}\to K^{*0}\overline{K}^{*0}$ and $B_d \to \rho^+ \rho^-$. Although we rely on previous work by other authors, we summarize the formalism so that the paper is self-contained and its results can be checked.</description>

      <title>Note on Klein-Nishina effect in strong-field QED: the case of nonlinear Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suitably normalized differential probabilities of one-photon emission in external electromagnetic fields are compared to quantify the transit of nonlinear Compton scattering to linear Compton scattering, described by the Klein-Nishina formula, and to constant crossed field treatment. The known Klein-Nishina suppression at large energies is further enforced by increasing field intensity. In view of the Ritus-Narozhny conjecture, we demonstrate that different paths in the field intensity vs. energy plane towards large values of the quantum non-linearity parameter $\chi$ facilitate significantly different asymptotic dependencies, both in the Klein-Nishina regime and the constant crossed field regime and in between.</description>

      <title>Introducing scalar leptoquarks into a 3-3-1 model to solve the $(g-2)_\mu $ puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce scalar leptoquarks into the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos with the aim of solving the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ puzzle. We show that besides the model supports leptoquarks in the octet, sextet, triplet and singlet representations, we identified that only one specif leptoquark in the singlet representation leads to flip of chirality as required to generate positive and robust contribution to the $(g-2)_\mu$. Then we calculate its contributions to $(g-2)_\mu$ and to the decay process $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ and discuss the results.</description>

      <title>Running Coupling and Running Quark Mass Effects on the Elastic Form Factors of Nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the elastic electric and magnetic form factors of the proton, neutron and the charged roper resonance ($G_E^p$, $G_M^p$, $G_E^n$, $G_M^n$, $G_E^R$ and $G_M^R$) systematically in a constituent quark model. Three ingredients are crucial in this study: i) the mixing of the $|70, ^{2}8,2,0,(\frac{1}{2})^{\textmd{+}}\rangle$ and the $|56, ^{2}8,0,0,(\frac{1}{2})^{\textmd{+}}\rangle$ which produces a nonzero neutron electric form factor. ii) a running coupling constant that soften the form factors. iii) the running quark mass function, $M_q(p^2)$, which is responsible for the decreasing of the $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ as $Q^2$ increases. The produced elastic form factors of the proton and neutron match the corresponding experiment values fairly well. Our study shows that $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2) \approx M_q(Q^2/9)/M_q(0)$ upto $Q^2 \approx 4 \text{GeV}^2$. We give predictions on the elactic form factors of the roper resonance, the charge and magnetic radius of the roper resonance compared with proton are $r^R_{E}/r^p_{E} \approx r^R_{M}/r^p_{M} \approx 1.5$.</description>

      <title>Impact of JLab data on the determination of GPDs at zero skewness and new insights from transition form factors $ N\rightarrow \Delta $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established now that the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness are playing important roles in some physical process such as elastic electron-nucleon scattering, elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering, and wide-angle Compton scattering (WACS) via various types of form factors (FFs). In this study, we are going to utilize the recent JLab measurements of the elastic electron-nucleon scattering reduced cross-section, namely GMp12, as a touchstone to unravel the tension observed between the measurements of the WACS cross-section and the data of the proton magnetic FF $ G_M^p $. We also investigate the impact of GMp12 data on valence unpolarized GPDs $ H_v^q $ and $ E_v^q $ at zero skewness by performing some $ \chi^2 $ analyses of the related experimental data. By calculating the electric and scalar quadrupole ratios, $ R_{EM} $ and $ R_{SM} $, and magnetic transition FF $ G^*_M/3G_D $ related to the nucleon-to-delta ($ N\rightarrow \Delta $) transition using the extracted GPDs and comparing the results with corresponding experimental measurements, we show that our results are in an excellent consistency with experiments, indicating the universality property of GPDs. We emphasize that the inclusion of these data in the future analysis of GPDs can significantly the extracted GPDs especially their uncertainties at smaller values of $ Q^2 $.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Formalism: Concrete Realization of Joint Measurement for Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation for Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error, disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes trivial, $0=0$, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability, provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in agreement with Heisenberg's value.</description>

      <title>A partitioned dipole-antenna shower with improved transverse recoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of a new final-state parton-shower algorithm in the Pythia event generator is described. The shower algorithm, dubbed Apollo, combines central aspects of the Vincia antenna shower with the global transverse-recoil scheme of the Alaric framework in order to achieve formal consistency with next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) resummation. The shower algorithm is constructed in such a way that it facilitates a straightforward combination with fixed-order calculations. As an explicit proof of concept, a general scheme for matrix-element corrections (MECs) and two separate multiplicative next-to-leading order (NLO) matching schemes are outlined. It is argued that both matching schemes retain the logarithmic accuracy of the shower. The improved modelling of radiation is examined by contrasting the new algorithm with existing leading-logarithmic parton showers in Pythia.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Do near-threshold molecular states mix with neighboring $\bar QQ$ states?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I comment on a paper by Christoph Hanhart and Alexey Nefediev, published in Phys. Rev. D 106, 114003 (2022). The authors discuss the interpretation of mesons close to their lowest decay threshold and present a mechanism for the formation of molecular states. The proposed formalism is then applied to the axial-vector mesons $D_{s1}(2536)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, presenting two scenarios for the lighter meson, namely a $D^\star K$ molecule or a compact $c\bar{s}$ state. The authors argue that the latter hypothesis requires a fine-tuning of the mixing angle between the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ and $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ $C$-parity eigenstates.
  In this Comment I show that no such fine-tuning is needed, as demonstrated in an article published in Phys. Rev. D 84, 094020 (2011), where a unitarized quark model was applied to the two $C$-parity eigenstates, coupled to several two-meson channels including $D^\star K$. The coupled-channel dynamics naturally leads to a mixing angle very close to the required one. Moreover, I argue that the $D_1(2420)$ and $D_1(2430)$ axial-vectors, not considered by the authors, as well as a lattice simulation in Phys. Rev. D 90, 034510 (2014), also not mentioned by the authors, do not lend support to a molecular interpretation of the $D_{s1}(2460)$. I conclude with some more general remarks about mesons coupling to $S$-wave thresholds.</description>

      <title>Implications of purity constraints on light higgsinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lightest supersymmetric particles could be higgsinos that have a small mixing with gauginos. If the lightest higgsino-like state makes up some or all of the dark matter with a thermal freezeout density, then its mass must be between about 100 and 1150 GeV, and dark matter searches put bounds on the amount of gaugino contamination that it can have. Motivated by the generally good agreement of flavor- and CP-violating observables with Standard Model predictions, I consider models in which the scalar particles of minimal supersymmetry are heavy enough to be essentially decoupled, except for the 125 GeV Higgs boson. I survey the resulting purity constraints as lower bounds on the gaugino masses and upper bounds on the higgsino mass splittings. I also discuss the mild excesses in recent soft lepton searches for charginos and neutralinos at the LHC, and show that they can be accommodated in these models if $\tan\beta$ is small and $\mu$ is negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the angular dependence of the recently proposed transverse momentum dependent quark and gluon diffractive parton distributions at small-$x$. We introduce the difractive versions of the Sivers function and the elliptic gluon Wigner distribution and evaluate them in simple models with gluon saturation and study their geometric scaling properties. We also show that the diffractive version of the linearly polarized gluon distribution identically vanishes to leading order. These distributions enrich the physics opportunities for measuring semi-inclsuive diffractive DIS processes at the future electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams as Computational Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a computational graph representation of high-order Feynman diagrams in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), applicable to any combination of spatial, temporal, momentum, and frequency domains. Utilizing the Dyson-Schwinger and parquet equations, our approach effectively organizes these diagrams into a fractal structure of tensor operations, significantly reducing computational redundancy. This approach not only streamlines the evaluation of complex diagrams but also facilitates an efficient implementation of the field-theoretic renormalization scheme, crucial for enhancing perturbative QFT calculations. Key to this advancement is the integration of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation, a key technique employed in machine learning packages to compute higher-order derivatives efficiently on computational graphs. To operationalize these concepts, we develop a Feynman diagram compiler that optimizes diagrams for various computational platforms, utilizing machine learning frameworks. Demonstrating this methodology's effectiveness, we apply it to the three-dimensional uniform electron gas problem, achieving unprecedented accuracy in calculating the quasiparticle effective mass at metal density. Our work demonstrates the synergy between QFT and machine learning, establishing a new avenue for applying AI techniques to complex quantum many-body problems.</description>

      <title>Exact evaluation of large-charge correlation functions in non-relativistic conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-charge master field which generates all n-point correlation functions with an insertion of large charge Q in non-relativistic conformal field theory is obtained. This field is used to compute Schr\"odinger-invariant n-point correlation functions of large-charge operators via a direct evaluation of the path integral. Conformal dimensions are found to agree with calculations based on the state-operator correspondence. The master field solution exhibits an emergent harmonic trap whose frequency is a function of the Euclidean time. The large-charge effective action with operator insertions describes a droplet of superfluid matter whose spatial size scales with the time separation of sources. The solution is used to compute Schr\"odinger symmetry breaking corrections in the large-charge effective field theory (EFT) due to a finite scattering length in the fundamental theory of fermions near unitarity. The scaling of these effects in the large-charge power counting scheme is established, and the size of the effects is quantified using input from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the near-unitary gas, as well as from the large-N expansion at large charge.</description>

Abstract: The tidal disruption of old, compact stellar structures provides strong constraints on macroscopic dark matter candidates such as primordial black holes. In view of recent, new observational data on the Eridanus II dwarf galaxy and on its central stellar cluster, we employ, for the first time, $N$-body simulations to assess the impact of compact massive dark matter candidates on the gravitational stability of the cluster. We find evidence that such candidates must be lighter than about one solar mass if they constitute the totality of the dark matter. We additionally derive robust constraints on the fraction of the dark matter in macroscopic objects as a function of mass, by suitably modeling the remainder of the dark matter as standard fluid-like cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Neutrino Decoupling and its Observable Imprints: Insights from Entropic-Dual Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very different processes characterize the decoupling of neutrinos to form the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) and the much later decoupling of photons from thermal equilibrium to form the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The C$\nu$B emerges from the fuzzy, energy-dependent neutrinosphere and encodes the physics operating in the early universe in the temperature range $T\sim 10\,{\rm MeV}$ to $T\sim10\,{\rm keV}$. This is the epoch where beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics may be influential in setting the light element abundances and the necessarily distorted fossil neutrino energy spectra. Here we use techniques honed in extensive CMB studies to analyze the C$\nu$B as calculated in detailed neutrino energy transport and nuclear reaction simulations. Our moment method, relative entropy, and differential visibility approach can leverage future high precision CMB and primordial abundance measurements to provide new insights into the C$\nu$B and any BSM physics it encodes. We demonstrate that the evolution of the energy spectrum of the C$\nu$B throughout the weak decoupling epoch is accurately captured in the Standard Model by only three parameters per species, a non-trivial conclusion given the deviation from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we can interpret each of the three parameters as physical characteristics of a non-equilibrium system. The success of our compact description within the Standard Model motivates its use also in BSM scenarios. We demonstrate how observations of primordial light element abundances can be used to place constraints on the C$\nu$B energy spectrum, deriving response functions that can be applied for general C$\nu$B spectral distortions. Combined with the description of those deviations that we develop here, our methods provide a convenient and powerful framework to constrain the impact of BSM physics on the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>An extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quark and nuclear matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to one capable of exploring quark and nuclear matter consistently. With an extra term standing for quark-nucleon interactions, nucleons could automatically emerge as color-singlet three-quark entities by following a process similar to mesons. Besides the quark part in mean field approximation, both mesons and nucleons could contribute to the thermodynamic potential thus possibly give rise to quarkyonic matter beyond mean field. In the study, two kinds of "confining" couplings are adopted for the new interaction term and two different quark masses are considered for comparison. It turns out that only confined nuclear matter or deconfined quark matter is possible for all the cases at zero temperature, thus quarkyonic matter is not favored at all. Even more strictly, only the case with stronger confinement effect and a smaller quark mass admits a physical first-order phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter around twice saturation density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) provide a phenomenological approach beyond the Standard Model, intended to capture tentative nonperturbative quantum gravity effects. Here, we show how to constrain a large class of MDRs by deriving the explicit corrections they induce upon the fermion spin coupling with an external magnetic field in the Pauli equation, the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation. We complete the general theoretical analysis with explicit phenomenological examples for which the physical free parameters can be bounded by high-precision tests, in particular the ones based on the measurement of the electron anomalous magnetic moment in a Penning trap.</description>

      <title>A search for super-imposed oscillations to the primordial power spectrum in Planck and SPT-3G 2018 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for super-imposed oscillations linearly or logarithmically spaced in Fourier wavenumbers in Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) 2018 temperature and polarization data. The SPT-3G temperature and polarization data provide a new window to test these oscillations at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. We consider both models with a constant and a Gaussian modulated amplitude, which correspond to three and four additional parameters beyond power-law primordial power spectrum for the templates considered, respectively. We find that each of the four models considered can provide an improved fit to Planck data, consistently with previous findings, and to SPT-3G data, always compared to $\Lambda$CDM. For a constant amplitude of the superimposed oscillations, we find tighter constraints on the amplitude of the oscillations from the combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. When the ranges of parameters which provide a better fit to Planck and SPT-3G data overlap, as in the case of Gaussian modulated oscillations, we find a larger $\Delta \chi^2$ - $- 17 \, (-16)$ for logarithmic (linear) oscillations - in a combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. These findings will be further tested with upcoming CMB temperature and polarization measurements at high multipoles provided by ongoing ground experiments.</description>

      <title>More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Analysis of $B\to K^{(*)}$ and $B_s\to \phi$ Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a stronger formulation of the dispersive (or unitarity) bounds \`a la Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL), which are commonly applied in analyses of the hadronic form factors for $B$ decays. In our approach, the existing bounds are split into several new bounds, thereby disentangling form factors that are jointly bounded in the common approach. This leads to stronger constraints for these objects, to a significant simplification of our numerical analysis, and to the removal of spurious correlations among the form factors. We apply these novel bounds to $\bar{B}\to \bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $\bar{B}_s\to \phi$ form factors by fitting them to purely theoretical constraints. Using a suitable parametrization, we take into account the form factors' below-threshold branch cuts arising from on-shell $\bar{B}_s \pi^0$ and $\bar{B}_s \pi^0 \pi^0$ states, which so-far have been ignored in the literature. In this way, we eliminate a source of hard-to-quantify systematic uncertainties. We provide machine readable files to obtain the full set of the $\bar{B}\to \bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $\bar{B}_s\to \phi$ form factors in and beyond the entire semileptonic phase space.</description>

Abstract: The total and differential cross sections of the elastic proton-neutron and antiproton-neutron scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime. Taking into account the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, which are described by the Reggeized spin-2 glueball and vector meson propagator respectively, those cross sections are obtained. It is presented that the currently available experimental data of the total cross sections can be well described within the model. Once a single adjustable parameter is determined with the total cross section data, the differential cross sections can be calculated without any additional parameters. Although the available differential cross section data are limited, it is found that our predictions are consistent with those.</description>

Abstract: We present a calculation of the master integrals (MI's) required for the calculation of the Electroweak corrections to $gg\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ production in which the process contains a light quark loop. The integrals can be broken down into five categories based on the flow of the heavy vector bosons throughout the loop. Three of the families are planar, and two are non-planar. We determine a canonical basis for each family which allows an efficient solution of the resulting differential equations via iterated integrals. We calculate the families in relevant physical kinematics and obtain an efficient numerical evaluation based on an implementation of Chen-iterated integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for renormalization group improvement of thermally resummed effective potential. In our method, $\beta$-functions are temperature dependent as a consequence of the divergence structure in resummed perturbation theory. In contrast to the ordinary $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme, the renormalization group invariance of the resummed finite-temperature effective potential holds order by order, which significantly mitigates a notorious renormalization scale dependence of phase transition quantities such as a critical temperature even at the one-loop order. We also devise a tractable method that enables one to incorporate temperature-dependent higher-order corrections by fully exploiting the renormalization group invariance.</description>

      <title>$(g-2)_\mu$ and Stau coannihilation : Dark Matter and Collider Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slepton coannihilation is one of the most promising scenarios that can bring the predicted Dark Matter (DM) abundance in the the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) into agreement with the experimental observation. In this scenario, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), usually assumed to be the lightest neutralino, can serve as a Dark Matter (DM) candidate while the sleptons as the next-to-LSPs (NLSPs) lie close in mass. In our previous studies analyzing the electroweak (EW) sector of MSSM, a degeneracy between the three generations of sleptons was assumed for the sake of simplicity. In case of slepton coannihilation this directly links the smuons involved in the explanation for $(g-2)_\mu$ to the coannihilating NLSPs required to explain the DM content of the universe. On the other hand, in well-motivated top-down models such degeneracy does not hold, and often the lighter stau turns out to be the NLSP at the EW scale, with the smuons (and selectrons) somewhat heavier. In this paper we analyze a non-universal slepton mass scenario at the EW scale where the first two generations of sleptons are taken to be mass-degenerate and heavier than the staus, enforcing stau coannihilation. We analyze the parameter space of the MSSM in the light of a variety of experimental data namely, the DM relic density and direct detection (DD) limits, LHC data and especially, the discrepancy between the experimental result for $(g-2)_\mu$, and its Standard Model (SM) prediction. We find an upper limit on the LSP and NLSP masses of about ~ 550 GeV. In contrast to the scenario with full degeneracy among the three families of sleptons, the upper limit on the light smuon/selectron mass moves up by ~ 200 GeV. We analyze the DD prospects as well as the physics potential of the HL-LHC and a future high-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider to investigate this scenario further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indirect detection is one of the most powerful methods to search for annihilating dark matter. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-perturbative effects in the indirect detection of dark matter. For this purpose we utilize a minimal model consisting of a fermionic dark matter candidate in the TeV mass range that interacts via scalar- and pseudo-scalar interactions with a massive scalar mediator mixing with the Higgs. The scalar interaction induces an attractive Yukawa potential between dark matter particles, such that annihilations are Sommerfeld enhanced, and bound states can form. These non-perturbative effects are systematically dealt with (potential) non-relativistic effective field theories and we derive the relevant cross sections for dark matter. We discuss their impact on the relic density and indirect detection. Annihilations in dwarf galaxies and the Galactic Center require special care and we derive generalized $J$-factors for these objects that account for the non-trivial velocity dependence of the cross sections in our model. We use limits on the gamma-ray flux based on Fermi-LAT observations and limits on the rate of exotic energy injection from Planck to derive bounds on the parameter space of the model. Finally, we estimate the impact that future limits from the Cherenkov Telescope Array are expected to have on the model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient approach for the general reduction of one-loop integrals. Our method employs the introduction of an auxiliary vector and the identification of the tensor structure as an auxiliary propagator. This key insight allows us to express a wide range of one-loop integrals, encompassing both tensor structures and higher poles, in the Baikov representation. By establishing an integral-by-parts (IBP) relation, we derive a recursive formula that systematically solves the one-loop reduction problem, even in the presence of various degenerate cases. Our proposed strategy is characterized by its simplicity and effectiveness, offering a significant advancement in the field of one-loop calculations.</description>

Abstract: We study the decays $\bar B^0 \to \bar K^0 \, X$, $B^- \to K^- \, X$, $\bar B^0_s \to \eta (\eta')\, X$, $\bar B^0 \to \bar K^{*0} \, X$, $B^- \to K^{*-} \, X$ , $\bar B_s^0 \to \phi \, X$, with $X \equiv X(3872)$, from the perspective of the $X(3872)$ being a molecular state made from the interaction of the $D^{*+} D^-, D^{*0} \bar D^0$ and $c.c.$ components. We consider both the external and internal emission decay mechanisms and find an explanation for the $\bar K^0 \, X$ and $K^- \, X$ production rates, based on the mass difference of the charged and neutral $D^* \bar D$ components. We also find that the internal and external emission mechanisms add constructively in the $\bar B^0 \to \bar K^0 \, X$, $B^- \to K^- \, X$ reactions, while they add destructively in the case of $\bar B^0 \to \bar K^{*0} \, X$, $B^- \to K^{*-} \, X$ reactions. This feature explains the decay widths of the present measurements and allows us to make predictions for the unmeasured modes of $\bar B^0_s \to \eta (\eta')\, X(3872)$ and $B^- \to K^{*-} \, X(3872)$. The future measurement of these decay modes will help us get a better perspective on the nature of the $X(3872)$ and the mechanisms present in production reactions of that state.</description>

      <title>Precise Estimate of Charged Higgsino/Wino Decay Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higgsinos and Winos in the supersymmetric Standard Model are prime candidates for dark matter due to their weakly interacting nature. The mass differences between their charged components (charginos) and neutral components (neutralinos) become degenerate when other superparticles are heavy, resulting in long-lived charginos. In the case of the Winos, the mass difference is approximately 160 MeV across a wide range of the parameter space. Consequently, the chargino decays into the lightest neutralino, emitting a single charged pion. For Higgsinos, however, mass differences ranging from O(0.1) GeV to O(1) GeV are possible, leading to a variety of decay channels. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis of Wino decay to the chargino with a larger mass difference. We emphasize characterizing its decay signatures through leptonic and hadronic modes. By utilizing the latest experimental data, we perform a comprehensive study of the decay rate calculations incorporating these hadronic modes to determine the impact on the predicted chargino lifetime. Additionally, we conduct next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations for the leptonic decay modes. Our NLO results can be applied to the case of more general fermionic electroweak multiplets, e.g., quintuplet dark matter.</description>

Abstract: The lepton flavor violating decays $h\to e_b^\pm e_a^\mp $, $Z\to e_b^\pm e_a^\mp$, and $e_b\to e_a \gamma$ will be discussed in the framework of the Two Higgs doublet model with presence of new inverse seesaw neutrinos and a singly charged Higgs boson that accommodate both $1\sigma$ experimental data of $(g-2)$ anomalies of the muon and electron. Numerical results indicate that there exist regions of the parameter space supporting all experimental data of $(g-2)_{e,\mu}$ as well as the promising LFV signals corresponding to the future experimental sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Interference Effects in $\mathbf{gg \to H \to Z \gamma}$ Beyond Leading Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC have recently announced evidence for the rare Higgs boson decay into a $Z$ boson and a photon. We analyze the interference between the process $gg\! \to \! H \! \to \! Z \gamma$ induced by loops of heavy particles, which is by far the dominant contribution to the signal, and the continuum $gg \to Z \gamma$ QCD background process mediated by light quark loops. This interference modifies the event yield, the resonance line-shape and the apparent mass of the Higgs boson. We calculate the radiative corrections to this interference beyond the leading-order approximation in perturbative QCD and find that, while differing numerically from the corresponding effects on the more studied $gg \! \to \! \gamma \gamma$ signal, they are generally rather small. As such, they do not impact significantly the interpretation of the present measurements of the $H \to Z \gamma$ decay mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the pressure from first principles within perturbative QCD at finite baryon density and very high magnetic fields up to two-loops and with physical quark masses. The region of validity for our framework is given by $m_s \ll \mu_q \ll \sqrt{eB}$, where $m_s$ is the strange quark mass, $\mu_q$ is the quark chemical potential, $e$ is the fundamental electric charge, and $B$ is the magnetic field strength. We include the effects of the renormalization scale in the running coupling, $\alpha_s (\mu_q,\sqrt{eB})$, and running strange quark mass. We also discuss the simplifications that come about in the chiral limit. The effectively negligible contribution of the exchange diagram allows for building a simple analytic model for the equation of state for pure quark magnetars and computing their mass and radius at very large values of $B$. These results provide constraints on the behavior of the maximum mass and associated radius from perturbative QCD. We also discuss the magnetic bag model for extreme magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how grand unification can be probed with experiments at low energies using quantum sensors. Specifically, we show that scalar multiplets coupled to the gauge sector of a grand unified theory provide a mechanism for a time-varying unified coupling which has low-energy consequences which can be probed with quantum sensors. We then assume that the multiplets represent ultra light dark matter. Constraints on ultra light dark matter couplings to regular matter are extracted using atomic clock comparisons, pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav) and MICROSCOPE.</description>

      <title>Correlation function and the inverse problem in the $BD$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the correlation functions of the $B^0 D^+, B^+ D^0$ system, which develops a bound state of approximately $40$ MeV, using inputs consistent with the $T_{cc}(3875)$ state. Then we address the inverse problem starting from these correlation functions to determine the scattering observables related to the system, including the existence of the bound state and its molecular nature. The important output of the approach is the uncertainty with which these observables can be obtained, considering errors in the $B^0 D^+, B^+ D^0$ correlation functions typical of current values in present correlation functions. We find that it is possible to obtain scattering lengths and effective ranges with relative high precision and the existence of a bound state. Although the pole position is obtained with errors of the order of $50 \%$ of the binding energy, the molecular probability of the state is obtained with a very small error of the order of $6\%$. All these findings can serve as motivation to perform such measurements in future runs of high energy hadron collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Ultra)light spin-$1$ particles -- dark photons -- can constitute all of dark matter (DM) and have beyond Standard Model couplings. This can lead to a coherent, oscillatory signature in terrestrial detectors that depends on the coupling strength. We provide a signal analysis and statistical framework for inferring the properties of such DM by taking into account (i) the stochastic and (ii) the vector nature of the underlying field, along with (iii) the effects due to the Earth's rotation. Owing to equipartition, on time scales shorter than the coherence time the DM field vector typically traces out a fixed ellipse. Taking this ellipse and the rotation of the Earth into account, we highlight a distinctive three-peak signal in Fourier space that can be used to constrain DM coupling strengths. Accounting for all three peaks, we derive latitude-independent constraints on such DM couplings, unlike those stemming from single-peak studies. We apply our framework to the search for ultralight $B - L$ DM using optomechanical sensors, demonstrating the ability to delve into previously unprobed regions of this DM candidate's parameter space.</description>

      <title>Revisit the heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the masses of heavy quarkonium double-gluon hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ in the framework of the QCD sum rules. Considering the double-gluon hybrid meson operators in the octet-octet color structure, we have constructed two independent interpolating currents with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and five independent currents with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$. For the interpolating currents with antisymmetric glueball operator, there exist non-local divergences in one kind of additional Feynman diagrams of tri-gluon condensate, which will give important contributions to the sum rule stabilities and mass predictions. We use the diagrammatic operator renormalization to cancel out such divergences. At the leading order of $\alpha_s$, the two-point correlation functions and spectral densities can be expressed in the analytic form of the generalized hypergeometric functions and Meijer's G-functions. After performing the numerical analysis, we predict the masses of the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ charmonium double-gluon hybrid mesons to be around $6.1-7.2$ GeV and $6.3-6.4$ GeV, respectively. For the bottomonium systems, their masses are predicted to be $13.7-14.3$ GeV and $12.6-13.3$ GeV for the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ channels, respectively. Besides, it is possible to hunt for these charmonium hybrids in the radiative decays of bottomonium mesons in BelleII experiment. Further investigations on these hybrid states in various theoretical and phenomenological methods are also anticipated in the future.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the matching of black hole tidal responses: a systematic study of relativistic and logarithmic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The worldline effective field theory (EFT) gives a gauge-invariant definition of black hole conservative tidal responses (Love numbers), dissipation numbers, and their spin-0 and spin-1 analogs. In the first part of this paper we show how the EFT allows us to circumvent the source/response ambiguity without having to use the analytic continuation prescription. The source/response ambiguity appears if Post-Newtonian (PN)corrections to external sources overlap with the response. However, these PN corrections can be clearly identified and isolated using the EFT. We illustrate that by computing static one-point functions of various external fields perturbing the four-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry. Upon resumming all relevant Feynman diagrams, we find that the PN terms that may mimic the response actually vanish for static black holes. Thus, the extraction of Love numbers from matching the EFT and general relativity (GR) calculations is completely unambiguous, and it implies that the Love numbers vanish identically for all types of perturbations. We also study in detail another type of fine tuning in the EFT, the absence of Love numbers' running. We show that logarithmic corrections to Love numbers do stem from individual loop diagrams in generic gauges, but cancel after all diagrams are summed over. In the particular cases of spin-0 and spin-2 fields the logarithms are completely absent if one uses the Kaluza-Klein metric decomposition. In the second part of the paper we compute frequency-dependent dissipative response contributions to the one-point functions using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We extract black hole dissipation numbers by comparing the one-point functions in the EFT and GR. Our results are in perfect agreement with those obtained from a manifestly gauge-invariant matching of absorption cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Novel high-frequency gravitational waves detection with split cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can generate electromagnetic effects inside a strong electric or magnetic field within the Standard Model and general relativity. Here we propose using a quarterly split cavity and LC(inductor and capacitor)-resonance circuit to detect a high-frequency gravitational wave from 0.1 MHz to GHz. We perform a full 3D simulation of the cavity's signal for sensitivity estimate. Our sensitivity depends on the coherence time scale of the high-frequency gravitational wave sources and the volume size of the split cavity. We discuss the resonant measurement schemes for narrow-band gravitational wave sources and also a non-resonance scheme for broadband signals. For a meter-sized split cavity under a 14 Tesla magnetic field, the LC resonance enhanced sensitivity to the gravitational wave strain is expected to reach $h\sim 10^{-20}$ around $10$ MHz.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tidal Response of Kerr Black Holes from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We match scattering amplitudes in point particle effective field theory (EFT) and general relativity to extract low frequency dynamical tidal responses of rotating (Kerr) black holes to all orders in spin. In the conservative sector, we study local worldline couplings that correspond to the time-derivative expansion of the black hole tidal response function. These are dynamical (frequency-dependent) generalizations of the static Love numbers. We identify and extract couplings of three types of subleading local worldline operators: the curvature time derivative terms, the spin - curvature time derivative couplings, and quadrupole - octupole mixing operators that arise due to the violation of spherical symmetry. The first two subleading couplings are non-zero and exhibit a classical renormalization group running; we explicitly present their scheme-independent beta functions. The conservative mixing terms, however, vanish as a consequence of vanishing static Love numbers. In the non-conservative sector, we match the dissipation numbers at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to leading orders in frequency. In passing, we identify terms in the general relativity absorption probabilities that originate from tails and short-scale logarithmic corrections to the lowest order dissipation contributions.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Invariance Violation Limits from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been long conjectured that a signature of Quantum Gravity will be Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) that could be observed at energies much lower than the Planck scale. One possible signature of LIV is an energy-dependent speed of photons. This can be tested with a distant transient source of very high-energy photons. We explore time-of-flight limits on LIV derived from LHAASO's observations of tens of thousands of TeV photons from GRB 221009A, the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time. For a linear ($n=1$) dependence of the photon velocity on energy, we find a lower limit on the subluminal (superluminal) LIV scale of ${5.9} (6.2) mpl$. These are comparable to the stringent limits obtained so far and, as an independent bound obtained from a different redshift, confirm their robustness. For a quadratic model ($n=2$, corresponding to $d=6$ SME operators), the limits, which are currently the best available with the time-of-flight method, are $5.8 (4.6) \times 10^{-8} mpl$. Our analysis uses the publicly available LHAASO data, which is only in the $0.2-7$ TeV range. Higher energy data would enable us to improve these limits by a factor of 3 for $n=1$ and by an order of magnitude for $n=2$.</description>

      <title>First demonstration of a liquid argon time projection chamber based search for intranuclear neutron-antineutron transitions and annihilation in $^{40}$Ar using the MicroBooNE detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology to search for intranuclear neutron-antineutron transition ($n\rightarrow\bar{n}$) followed by $\bar{n}$-nucleon annihilation within an $^{40}$Ar nucleus, using the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector. A discovery of $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ transition or a new best limit on the lifetime of this process would either constitute physics beyond the Standard Model or greatly constrain theories of baryogenesis, respectively. The approach presented in this paper makes use of deep learning methods to select $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ events based on their unique features and differentiate them from cosmogenic backgrounds. The achieved signal and background efficiencies are (70.22$\pm$6.04)\% and (0.0020$\pm$0.0003)\%, respectively. A demonstration of a search is performed with a data set corresponding to an exposure of $3.32 \times10^{26}\,$neutron-years, and where the background rate is constrained through direct measurement, assuming the presence of a negligible signal. With this approach, no excess of events over the background prediction is observed, setting a demonstrative lower bound on the $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ lifetime in $^{40}$Ar of $\tau_{\textrm{m}} \gtrsim 1.1\times10^{26}\,$years, and on the free $n\rightarrow\bar{n}$ transition time of $\tau_{\textrm{\nnbar}} \gtrsim 2.6\times10^{5}\,$s, each at the $90\%$ confidence level. This analysis represents a first-ever proof-of-principle demonstration of the ability to search for this rare process in LArTPCs with high efficiency and low background.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we study the possible production of the heavy neutral dark gauge boson (A$^{\prime}$) candidates, which originated from a simplified model based on the Einstein-Cartan gravity, in association with dark matter. This study has been performed by studying events with dimuon plus missing transverse energy produced in the simulated proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, at 13.6 TeV center of mass energy and integrated luminosity of 52 fb$^{-1}$ corresponding to the LHC RUN III circumstances. We provide upper limits, in case no new physics has been discovered, on the masses for various particles in the model as, spin-1 (A$^{\prime}$), as well as the heavy mediator (torsion field).</description>

      <title>Higher-form symmetry and chiral transport in real-time lattice $U(1)$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical lattice simulations of theories of electrodynamics coupled to charged matter at finite temperature, interpreting them using the higher-form symmetry formulation of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We compute transport coefficients using classical Kubo formulas on the lattice and show that the properties of the simulated plasma are in complete agreement with the predictions from effective field theories. In particular, the higher-form formulation allows us to understand from hydrodynamic considerations the relaxation rate of axial charge in the chiral plasma observed in previous simulations. A key point is that the resistivity of the plasma -- defined in terms of Kubo formulas for the electric field in the 1-form formulation of MHD -- remains a well-defined and predictive quantity at strong electromagnetic coupling. However, the Kubo formulas used to define the conventional conductivity vanish at low frequencies due to electrodynamic fluctuations, and thus the concept of the conductivity of a gauged electric current must be interpreted with care.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of vector mesons by second-order hydrodynamic gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting with the polarization dependent Wigner function of vector mesons, we derive an expression for the 00-component ($\rho_{00}$) of spin density matrix in terms of the second order gradients of the vector meson distribution functions. We further apply a thermal model to analyze the transverse momentum and the azimuthal angle dependence of $\rho_{00}$ for $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ mesons resulting from distribution gradients in Au-Au collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=130$ GeV at mid-rapidity. Our results for the transverse momentum dependence indicate that the deviations of $\rho_{00}$ from $1/3$ as the signal for spin alignment are greatly enhanced at large transverse momenta and have a strong centrality dependence while analysis of the azimuthal angle ($\phi_q$) dependence suggest that such deviations have a $\cos(2\phi_q)$ structure with opposite sign for $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$. Our finding may be considered as a baseline for probing spin-alignment mechanisms beyond hydrodynamic gradients.</description>

      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study Wilsonian momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms of the cutoff. We show that already at order $\left(4-d\right)^{1}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the $\phi^{4}$ theory, there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor $\phi^{4}$ model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed if the different flavors have different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG). In future works we will study Wilsonian RG to order $\left(4-d\right)^{2}$ and find non-universal critical exponents that depend on the cutoff.</description>
