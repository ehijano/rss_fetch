      <title>Local structure of centred tangent cones in the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the geometric tangent cone to a probability measure with finite second moment. It is known that the tangent elements induced by a map belong to the $L^2_{\mu}$ closure of smooth gradients. We show that at the opposite, the elements that have barycenter 0 are characterized by a local condition, i.e. as the barycenter-free measures that are concentrated on a family of vector subspaces attached to any point. Our results rely on a decomposition of a measure into $d+1$ components, each allowing optimal plans to split mass in a fixed number of directions. We conclude by giving some links with Preiss tangent measures and illustrating the difference with Alberti and Marchese's decomposability bundle.</description>

      <title>Conic Formulations of Transport Metrics for Unbalanced Measure Networks and Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) variant of optimal transport, designed to compare probability densities defined over distinct metric spaces, has emerged as an important tool for the analysis of data with complex structure, such as ensembles of point clouds or networks. To overcome certain limitations, such as the restriction to comparisons of measures of equal mass and sensitivity to outliers, several unbalanced or partial transport relaxations of the GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. This paper is concerned with the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance introduced by S\'{e}journ\'{e}, Vialard, and Peyr\'{e}. We provide a novel formulation in terms of semi-couplings, and extend the framework beyond the metric measure space setting, to compare more general network and hypernetwork structures. With this new formulation, we establish several fundamental properties of the CGW metric, including its scaling behavior under dilation, variational convergence in the limit of volume growth constraints, and comparison bounds with established optimal transport metrics. We further derive quantitative bounds that characterize the robustness of the CGW metric to perturbations in the underlying measures. The hypernetwork formulation of CGW admits a simple and provably convergent block coordinate ascent algorithm for its estimation, and we demonstrate the computational tractability and scalability of our approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world high-dimensional and structured datasets.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ over Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to study isometries of the $1$-Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ over Carnot groups endowed with horizontally strictly convex norms. Well-known examples of horizontally strictly convex norms on Carnot groups are the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ endowed with the Heisenberg-Kor\'anyi norm, or with the Naor-Lee norm; and $H$-type Iwasawa groups endowed with a Kor\'anyi-type norm. We prove that on a general Carnot group there always exists a horizontally strictly convex norm. The main result of the paper says that if $(\mathbf{G},N_{\mathbf{G}})$ is a Carnot group where $N_{\mathbf{G}}$ is a horizontally strictly convex norm on $\mathbf{G}$, then the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ is isometrically rigid. That is, for every isometry $\Phi:\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})\to\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ there exists an isometry $\psi:\mathbf{G}\to \mathbf{G}$ such that $\Phi=\psi_{\#}$.</description>

      <title>Curtain Model for CAT(0) Spaces and Isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the dynamics of isometries in the curtain model, which is used to capture the hyperbolicity in a fixed CAT(0) space. We establish several fundamental properties, fully classify the behavior of semisimple isometries of a CAT(0) space in the associated curtain model, and prove that an isometry is contracting in a CAT(0) space if and only if it becomes loxodromic in the curtain model. Additionally, we exclude the presence of parabolic actions in most cases of interest, allowing the use of ping-pong like techniques on the curtain model to provide insights into the study of CAT(0) groups.</description>
