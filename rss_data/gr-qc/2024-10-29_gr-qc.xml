      <title>Reconstructions of Einstein-Aether Gravity from Barrow Agegraphic and New Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy models: Examinations and Observational Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation exploring the theoretical framework of Einstein-Aether gravity theory when combined with two novel cosmological paradigms: the Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy (BADE) and its newer variant, the New Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy (NBADE). Our study focuses on deriving the functional relationships within Einstein-Aether gravity as they emerge from these dark energy formulations. The parameter space of our theoretical models is rigorously constrained through statistical analysis employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology, utilizing multiple observational datasets, incorporating measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the combined Pantheon+SH0ES compilation. Based on our optimized parameter sets, we conduct an extensive analysis of fundamental cosmological indicators, including cosmographic parameter evolution, dark energy equation of state parameter ($\omega_{DE}$), evolution of the density parameter $\Omega(z)$, dynamical characteristics in the $\omega'_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ space, behavior of statefinder diagnostic pairs $(r,s^*)$ and $(r,q)$, and Om(z) diagnostic trajectories. Our analysis demonstrates that the current cosmic expansion exhibits accelerated behavior, with the dark energy component manifesting quintessence-like properties in the present epoch while trending toward phantom behavior in future evolution. We additionally evaluate the viability of both BADE and NBADE frameworks through an examination of the squared sound speed ($v_s^2$) stability criterion. The cumulative evidence suggests that these models effectively characterize contemporary cosmic evolution while offering novel perspectives on dark energy phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Local coordinates and motion of a test particle in the McVittie spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the orbital motion of a test particle in the gravitational field of a massive body (that might be a black hole) with mass $m$ placed on the expanding cosmological manifold described by the McVittie metric. We introduce the local coordinates attached to the massive body to eliminate nonphysical, coordinates-dependent effects associated with Hubble expansion. The resultant equation of motion of the test particle are analyzed by the method of osculating elements with application of time-averaging technique. We demonstrate that the orbit of the test particle is not subject to the cosmological expansion up to the terms of the second order in the Hubble parameter. However, the cosmological expansion causes the precession of the orbit of the test particle with time and changes the frequency of the mean orbital motion. We show that the direction of motion of the orbital precession depends on the Hubble parameter as well as the deceleration parameter of the universe. We give numeric estimates for the rate of the orbital precession with respect to time due to the cosmological expansion in case of several astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for Gravitational Wave Memory Detection in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we derive two computationally efficient frequentist detection statistics that can be used in searches for gravitational-wave bursts with memory in pulsar timing data. By maximizing the likelihood ratio in two different ways we construct a coherent statistic and an incoherent statistic, which are analogs of the $\pazocal{F}_e$ and $\pazocal{F}_p$ statistics commonly used for continuous-wave searches in pulsar timing data. We show that both statistics are $\chi^2$-distributed with varying degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameters given by the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the signal present in our data. The statistics can also be used to compute the maximum likelihood estimators of amplitude parameters of a possible gravitational-wave memory signal in pulsar timing data. We find that in the low-signal regime ($\mathrm{SNR} \lesssim 5$), the estimators are inaccurate. However, in intermediate- to high-signal regimes, we show that these estimators can accurately determine the correct signal parameters.</description>

      <title>Verification of the First Law of Horizon Thermodynamics for Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman Black Holes in Four-Dimensional f(R) Gravity with Dual Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the validity of the first law of horizon thermodynamics for Schwarzschild, RN, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman (KN) black holes within the framework of four-dimensional f(R) gravity coupled with dual scalar fields. Starting from a five-dimensional membrane world scenario, we derive the four-dimensional effective f(R) gravity action and obtain the corresponding black hole solutions. We then verify that these solutions satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics by explicitly calculating the variations of thermodynamic quantities. The analysis confirms the robustness of the horizon thermodynamics framework in extended gravitational theories, providing insights into the interplay between higher-dimensional theories and four-dimensional black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Search for exotic gravitational wave signals beyond general relativity using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves by LIGO has confirmed general relativity (GR) and sparked rapid growth in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, subtle post-Newtonian (PN) deviations observed during the analysis of high signal-to-noise ratio events from the observational runs suggest that standard waveform templates, which assume strict adherence to GR, might overlook signals from alternative theories of gravity. Incorporating these exotic signals into traditional search algorithms is computationally infeasible due to the vast template space required. This paper introduces a deep learning framework for detecting exotic GW signals, leveraging neural networks trained on GR-based templates. Through their generalization ability, neural networks learn intricate features from the data, enabling the detection of signals that deviate from GR. We present the first study evaluating the capability of deep learning to detect beyond-GR signals, including a variety of PN orders. Our model achieves rapid and accurate identification of exotic GW signals across different luminosity distances, with performance comparable to GR-based detections. Applying the model to the GW150914 event demonstrates excellent performance, highlighting the potential of AI-driven methods for detecting previously overlooked signals beyond GR. This work paves the way for new discoveries in gravitational wave astronomy, enabling the detection of signals that might escape traditional search pipelines.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in $f(R,T)=R+\lambda T+\lambda_1 T^2$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores asymptotically flat wormhole solutions within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. We analyze $f(R,T)$ expressed as $f(R,T)=R+\lambda T+\lambda_1 T^2$. A linear equation of state is employed for both radial and lateral pressures, resulting in a power-law shape function. The investigation encompasses solutions characterized by both negative and positive energy densities. It has been determined that solutions with positive energy density comply with all energy conditions, specifically the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. Additionally, we identify constraints on the parameters $\lambda$, $\lambda_1$, and the parameters associated with the equation of state and shape function.</description>

      <title>The maximum radiated energy and final spin of high speed collision of two black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a series of 739 full numerical simulations of high energy collision of black holes to search for the maximum gravitational energy emitted $E_{rad}$, during their merger. We consider equal mass binaries with spins pointing along their orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ and perform a search over impact parameters $b$ and initial linear momenta $p/m=\gamma v$ to find the maximum $E_{rad}$ for a given spin $\vec{S}$. The total radiated energy proves to have a weak dependence on the intrinsic spin $s$ of the holes, for the sequence $s=+0.8, 0.0, -0.8$ studied here. We thus estimate the maximum $E_{rad}^{max}/M_{ADM}\approx25\%\pm2\%$ for these direct merger encounters. We also explore the radiated angular momentum and the maximum spin of the merger remnant (within these configurations), finding $\alpha_f^{max}=0.987$. We then use the zero frequency limit expansion to analytically model the radiated energy in the small impact parameter and large initial linear momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning based Glitch Veto for inspiral binary merger signals using Linear Chirp Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unphysical templates for inspiral binary merger signals have emerged as an effective way to veto signals (rule out false positives) identified as glitches. These templates help reduce the parameters needed to distinguish glitches from real gravitational wave signals. Glitches are short, transient noise artifacts which often mimic the true signals, complicating gravitational wave detection. In this study, we apply the chirp transform -- a modification of the Fourier transform incorporating a linear chirp rate, denoted as $\gamma$. This method better tracks signals with varying frequencies, essential for analyzing inspiral merger events. By applying the chirp transform to gravitational wave strain time series, we generate 3D spectrograms with time,frequency and chirp axes, providing a richer dataset for analysis.These spectrograms reveal subtle features ideal for classification tasks. We leverage the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance the accuracy. CNNs are well suited for image based data like these, and we have optimized them to differentiate glitches from true merger signals. Our approach achieves high accuracy on both training and validation datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of combining the chirp transform with deep learning for signal classification. Ultimately we offer a refined efficient classification process by overlapping machine learning and Chirp transform, which will enhance accuracy of glitch detection from observations from detectors like LIGO, VIRGO and upcoming observatories.</description>

      <title>Accretion Phenomena of Different Kinds of Chaplygin Gas Models onto Kehagias-Sfetsos Black Hole in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Horava Lifshitz gravity scenario, we have described the mass accretion process of a 4 dimensional Kehagias Sfetsos black hole caused by some candidates of dark energy in detail. Firstly, we have obtained the equation of mass for the black hole with respect to the cosmic scale parameter a in the Horava Lifshitz gravity framework. Then, one by one, we have considered dark energies like Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin gas, Variable Modified Chaplygin gas, New Variable Modified Chaplygin gas, Modified Chaplygin Jacobi gas, and Modified Chaplygin Abel gas, respectively, and established their equation of mass in terms of the redshift function z. In addition, we have presented the results with graphical representations of the mass and redshift functions. Finally, we came to the conclusion that, due to the accretion of all of the dark energy candidates mentioned above, the mass of a 4-dimensional Kehagias-Sfetsos Black Hole will increase gradually in correspondence to the evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Formation of nonsingular spherical black holes with holonomy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a canonical model of spherical gravity with covariant corrections motivated by loop quantum gravity. The effective Hamiltonian defines univocally a family of geometries that generalizes the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes, and they can be matched to the vacuum of the theory across a timelike hypersurface comoving with the flow of matter. Such is precisely the complete spacetime picture of a spherical star subject to its own gravitational pull. The singularity gets replaced with a spacelike boundary in the trapped region of spacetime, where the curvature remains finite, and the area of the orbits of the spherical symmetry group attains its infimum. Observers falling into the black hole are doomed to travel forever towards this boundary without ever reaching it. The theory also predicts the formation of stable black-hole remnants of Planckian mass.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal coupling of scalar fields in the dark sector and generalization of the top-hat collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new way to handle interactions between two scalar fields in the cosmological backdrop where one scalar field oscillates rapidly in the cosmological time scale while the other does not show any periodic behavior in the same time scale. We have interpreted the rapidly oscillating scalar field as the dark matter candidate while the other scalar field is supposed to be the canonical quintessence field or the non-canonical phantom field. A model of a generalized top-hat-like collapse is developed where the dark sector is composed of the aforementioned scalar fields. We show how the non-minimal coupling in the dark sector affects the gravitational collapse of a slightly overdense spherical patch of the universe. The results show that one can have both unclustered and clustered dark energy in such collapses, the result depends upon the magnitude of the non-minimal coupling strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson stars are of significant interest in both gravity theory and particle physics, with sizes ranging from super-galaxy scale to black holes for gravitational wave events. Recently, an intriguing parity-odd rotating boson star has been proposed. We investigate the lensing effects of these parity-odd rotating boson stars, studying their images in detail. Our analysis demonstrates the distinct gravitational distortions around these stars, clearly differentiating them from their parity-even counterparts. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which chaotic behavior appears in the images of ultra-compact stars.</description>

      <title>Screen chaotic motion by Shannon entropy in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a novel characteristic for chaotic motion by introducing Shannon entropy for periodic orbits, quasiperiodic orbits, and chaotic orbits.We compare our approach with the previous methods including Poincar\'{e} Section, Lyapunov exponent, Fast Lyapunov Indicator, Recurrence plots(Rps), and Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) for orbits around black hole immersed in magnetic fields, and show that they agree with each other quite well. The approach of Shannon entropy is intuitively clear, and theoretically reasonable since it becomes larger and larger form a periodic orbit to chaotic orbit. We demonstrate that Shannon entropy can be a powerful probe to distinguish between chaotic and regular orbits in different spacetimes, and reversely may lead to a new road to define the entropy for a single orbit in phase space, and to find more fundamental relations between thermodynamics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effective Action and Gravitational Pair Production in (A)dS Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the effective action for a massive scalar field in (A)dS spacetime using the Euclidean heat kernel method. We highlight that in even-dimensional dS spacetimes, the effective action exhibits a non-trivial imaginary part, reminiscent of the Schwinger effect in quantum electrodynamics. We find consistency between the results obtained from the Euclidean heat kernel method with those from the Green's function approach in Lorentzian signature. Additionally, we compare our results with the perturbative calculations and find that the perturbation theory almost fails to capture the correct non-perturbative imaginary part of the effective action. This discrepancy presents a challenge to computing the gravitational pair production using the perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Kinetic dynamics of neutral spin particles in a spacetime with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kinetic model for the dynamics of collisionless spin neutral particles in a spacetime with torsion is proposed. The fundamental matter field is the kinetic density $f(x,u,s)$ of particles with four-velocity $u$ and four-spin $s$. The stress-energy tensor and the spin current of the particles distribution are defined as suitable integral moments of $f$ in the $(u,s)$ variables. By requiring compatibility with the contracted Bianchi identity in Einstein-Cartan theory, we derive a transport equation on the kinetic density $f$ that generalizes the well-known Vlasov equation for spinless particles. The total number of particles in the new model is not conserved. To restore this important property we assume the existence in spacetime of a second species of particles with the same mass and spin magnitude. The Vlasov equation on the kinetic density $\overline{f}$ of the new particles is derived by requiring that the sum of total numbers of particles of the two species should be conserved.</description>

      <title>Equivalence in virtual transitions between uniformly accelerated and static atoms: from a bird's eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prospect of equivalence principle at the quantum regime by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector in different scenarios. In particular, two specific set-ups are considered. ($i$) {\it Without a boundary}: In one scenario the atom is in uniform acceleration and interacting with Minkowski field modes. While in the other the atom is static and in interaction with Rindler field modes. ($ii$) {\it With a reflecting boundary}: In one scenario the atom is uniformly accelerated and the mirror is static, and in the other scenario the atom is static and the mirror is in uniform acceleration. In these cases the atom is interacting with the field modes, defined in mirror's frame. For both the set-ups, the focus is on the excitation and de-excitation probabilities in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$ spacetime dimensions. Our observations affirm that in $(1+1)$ dimensions, for both set-ups the transition probabilities from different scenarios become the same when the atomic and the field frequencies are equal. In contrast, in $(3+1)$ dimensions this equivalence is not observed in general, inspiring us to look for a deeper physical interpretation. Our findings suggest that when the equivalence between different scenarios is concerned, the excitation to de-excitation ratio provides a more consistent measure even in $(3+1)$ dimensions. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Minisuperspace model of quantum geometrodynamics in the Madelung-Bohm formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analogy between non-relativistic quantum mechanics in the Madelung formulation and quantum geometrodynamics in the case of the maximally symmetric space is drawn. The equations equivalent to the continuity equation and the hydrodynamic Euler equation describing the evolution of the velocity introduced for the case of hypothetical fluid flow characterizing the cosmological system are obtained. It is shown that the perfect nature of the fluid is broken by the quantum Bohm potential. The quantum potential is calculated in semi-classical approximation for different forces acting in the system both in standard quantum mechanics and in minisuperspace model of quantum geometrodynamics. The explicit dependences of the cosmic scale factor on the conformal time, which take into account the quantum additive, are found for empty space with spatial curvature and for a spatially flat universe with dust and radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we prove the Riemannian analog of black hole mode stability for Hermitian, non-self-dual gravitational instantons which are either asymptotically locally flat (ALF) and Ricci-flat, or compact and Einstein with positive cosmological constant. We show that the Teukolsky equation on any such manifold is a positive definite operator. We also discuss the compatibility of the results with the existence of negative modes associated to variational instabilities.</description>

      <title>Hidden Conformal Symmetry of the Discrete Series Scalars in dS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $D$ dimensional de Sitter space, a scalar field has an infinite tower of special tachyonic mass values at which enhanced shift symmetries appear. After modding out by these shift symmetries, these fields correspond to the unitary irreducible representations of the de Sitter group known as the discrete series. We show that in $D=2$ these theories have global conformal symmetry. In all but the massless case, these theories have no stress tensor and the conformal symmetry does not act in the usual way on the scalar field. We find the conformal symmetry by explicitly computing the correlators of the shift invariant local operators and showing that they take conformally invariant forms. We also demonstrate how these fields are self dual in $D=2$, and dual to the shift invariant massive vector fields, which are therefore also conformally invariant.</description>

      <title>How to Escape from a Trap: Outcomes of Repeated Black Hole Mergers in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be major sources of astrophysical gravitational waves (GWs), contributing both to the observed LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA population of binary BH mergers and to future populations of LISA-band extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The ability of these BHs to pair up into binaries, inspiral, and produce GWs will be shaped by the existence of migration traps, regions in the AGN where hydrodynamic torques vanish. Previous works have studied the existence and location of migration traps in AGN disks. Here, we investigate how individual BHs may escape such traps as an outcome of mergers, potentially suppressing hierarchical growth. We find that while GW recoil kicks are strong enough to kick merged BHs onto inclined orbits, gas drag quickly realigns them into the AGN disk. A more robust escape mechanism is gap opening: once a BH grows above a critical mass, its gravity disturbs the AGN gas sufficiently to eliminate the trap. In low-mass AGN relevant for LISA, gaps open easily and the resulting ``wet EMRI'' masses are unlikely to reflect protracted hierarchical mergers. In combination with our previous work, we find that migration traps only exist in a relatively narrow range of AGN luminosities between [10^{43.5},10^{45.5}] erg/s. We identify an even narrower AGN luminosity range for which stellar mass BHs can grow into the pair instability mass gap and beyond. This characteristic luminosity scale may assist in indirect tests of the ``AGN channel'' for binary BH mergers.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation in non-Gaussian noise using Score-Based Likelihood Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) parameter estimation typically assumes that instrumental noise is Gaussian and stationary. Obvious departures from this idealization are typically handled on a case-by-case basis, e.g., through bespoke procedures to ``clean'' non-Gaussian noise transients (glitches), as was famously the case for the GW170817 neutron-star binary. Although effective, manipulating the data in this way can introduce biases in the inference of key astrophysical properties, like binary precession, and compound in unpredictable ways when combining multiple observations; alternative procedures free of the same biases, like joint inference of noise and signal properties, have so far proved too computationally expensive to execute at scale. Here we take a different approach: rather than explicitly modeling individual non-Gaussianities to then apply the traditional GW likelihood, we seek to learn the true distribution of instrumental noise without presuming Gaussianity and stationarity in the first place. Assuming only noise additivity, we employ score-based diffusion models to learn an empirical noise distribution directly from detector data and then combine it with a deterministic waveform model to provide an unbiased estimate of the likelihood function. We validate the method by performing inference on a subset of GW parameters from 400 mock observations, containing real LIGO noise from either the Livingston or Hanford detectors. We show that the proposed method can recover the true parameters even in the presence of loud glitches, and that the inference is unbiased over a population of signals without applying any cleaning to the data. This work provides a promising avenue for extracting unbiased source properties in future GW observations over the coming decade.</description>

Abstract: We perform the manifestly covariant quantization of $f(R)$ gravity in the de Donder gauge condition (or harmonic gauge condition) for general coordinate invariance. We explicitly calculate various equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs), in particlular, the ETCR between the metric and its time derivative, and show that it has a nonvanishing and nontrivial expression, whose situation should be contrasted to the previous result in the higher-derivative or quadratic gravity where the ETCR was found to be identically vanishing. We also clarify global symmetries, the physical content of $f(R)$ gravity, and clearly show that this theory is manifestly unitary and has a massive scalar and massless graviton as physical modes.</description>

      <title>Composite running vacuum in the Universe: implications on the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that the vacuum energy density (VED) could be time dependent in the expanding Universe is intuitively more reasonable than just a rigid cosmological constant for the entire cosmic history. The framework of the running vacuum model (RVM) is a salient example derived from QFT in curved spacetime, wherein the VED appears as a power series of the Hubble rate, $H(t)$, and its derivatives. The RVM contributes to alleviate the cosmological tensions and at a more fundamental level it also helps to smooth out certain hardcore aspects of the cosmological constant problem. Composite dark energy (DE) extensions of the RVM are possible, in which the DE is a mixed fluid made out of running vacuum and an entity X called ``phantom matter'' which, I should stress, is radically different from phantom DE, since the former produces positive pressure like ordinary matter (therein its name). The prototype is the old $\Lambda$XCDM model from 2006. Recently a simplified version of the latter, called the $w$XCDM, has proven capable to yield a truly outstanding fit to the cosmological data with dramatic implications for mitigating the cosmological tensions. The analysis is sensitive to the kind of BAO data used, transversal (2D) or anisotropic (3D). For both BAO types the overall fit quality is substantially better than for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, and the growth tension becomes alleviated. Nevertheless, only for 2D BAO the $H_0$-tension can be completely cut down. Most notably, this scenario favours (at $3.3\sigma$ c.l.) quintessence-like behavior around our time, as recently reported by the DESI Collaboration. In what follows I will summarize in very simple phenomenological terms the essentials of the RVM idea and its composite extensions, as well as the remarkable practical implications ensuing from such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We construct projection operators onto the subspace of fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift states via the replica trick. We find that the density of state for the length and the timeshift is finite. This implies that the spectrum of these quantities is discrete microscopically. Utilizing the projection operator, we construct the microscopic length operator and the timeshift operator. Using these non-perturbative geometric operators, we study the time evolution of the thermofield double state. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty of the length and the timeshift. In particular, the probability of obtaining the negative timeshift states, which have contracting interior geometry and thus correspond to a white hole, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>Non-metricity approach to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct 2d Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity based on a non-metricity tensor. In symmetric teleparallel gravity, we often use the scalar quantity $Q$ composed of the bilinear terms of the non-metricity tensor but $Q$ is not a unique scalar quantity from the viewpoint of covariance. However, other scalar quantities composed of the non-metricity tensor generate ghosts in general. In two dimensions, because a propagating gravitational mode does not exist, if we consider general scalar quantities, there might appear any propagating modes although these modes are often ghosts. We consider a general combination of the terms given by the bi-linear of the non-metricity tensors. After finding the condition that the conformal form of the metric is compatible with the coincident gauge, where connections vanish, we determine the combination so that a solution with constant curvature exists. The obtained model corresponds to 2d JT gravity in the framework of the symmetric teleparallel gravity. The conformal mode propagates as a scalar in this theory and we also consider the condition that the scalar mode is not a ghost.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter (DM) and quark matter on $f$-mode oscillation of DM admixed quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness for DMSQSs.</description>

      <title>Towards a uniqueness theorem for static black holes in Kaluza-Klein theory with small circle size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kaluza-Klein theory, by which we mean vacuum gravity in 5-dimensions, with asymptotics that are a product of a circle with Minkowski spacetime, has a variety of different static black hole solutions; localized black holes and the homogeneous and inhomogeneous black strings. There is currently no uniqueness theorem for the solutions, and for fixed circle size multiple solutions with the same mass co-exist. Intuitively for small circle sizes we might expect the theory truncates to become 4-dimensional, and correspondingly the only black holes are the homogeneous black strings. Thus we conjecture that for fixed mass and sufficiently small circle size, the only black holes are homogeneous ones. Here we give evidence that this is indeed the case. Firstly we introduce a toy scalar field model with a potential that allows tachyonic behaviour. Putting this theory on a product of Minkowski with a circle gives an analogous set of static homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions to that of the black holes. We prove that solutions must be homogeneous for small circle sizes, the analog of our conjecture for this toy model. A weaker statement that is straightforward to derive is a bound on how inhomogeneous a solution can be - putting this scalar theory in a large but finite cavity, a norm of the wavefunction of the Kaluza-Klein modes can be shown to vanish in the small circle limit. Turning to the full gravitational theory, we employ a metric ansatz that imposes static axisymmetry, encompasses the homogeneous and inhomogeneous black strings (but not the localized solutions) and allows us to measure inhomogeneity of a solution. Employing a finite cavity and imposing boundary conditions that are compatible with homogeneity we show a similar result; the norm of certain Kaluza-Klein modes is bounded by the circle size, providing evidence that our conjecture is true.</description>

      <title>State Swapping via Semiclassical Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of non-local phenomena is a key attribute of quantum mechanics that distinguishes it from classical theories. It was recently suggested that state swapping is one such effect that a fundamentally classical gravitational field cannot give rise to. The reasoning was that the phenomenology of classical fields is restricted to Local Operations and Classical Communication~(LOCC) whereas swapping is a non-LOCC effect, so gravity must not be a classical channel if it can give rise to such a phenomenon. Here, we show that the Hamiltonian of semiclassical gravity results in an evolution of coherent states that is virtually indistinguishable from swapping them, both theoretically and experimentally. Our results indicate that drawing a definitive conclusion about the nature of gravity based solely on its ability to swap a pair of coherent states would be premature. We discuss the implications of these results regarding proposed experimental tests for the quantum nature of gravity and clarify some conceptual issues.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection for gravitational waves with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an accelerated pipeline, based on high-performance computing techniques and normalizing flows, for joint Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection and demonstrate its efficiency in gravitational wave astrophysics. We integrate the Jim inference toolkit, a normalizing flow-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, with the learned harmonic mean estimator. Our Bayesian evidence estimates run on $1$ GPU are consistent with traditional nested sampling techniques run on $16$ CPU cores, while reducing the computation time by factors of $5\times$ and $15\times$ for $4$-dimensional and $11$-dimensional gravitational wave inference problems, respectively. Our code is available in well-tested and thoroughly documented open-source packages, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility for the wider research community.</description>

      <title>Off-equatorial deflections and gravitational lensing. I. In Kerr spacetime and effect of spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates off-equatorial plane deflections and gravitational lensing of both null and timelike signals in Kerr spacetime in the weak deflection limit, with the finite distance effect of the source and detector taken into account. This is the effect caused by the fact that both the source and detector are located at finite distances from the lens, while many researchers often use the deflection angle for infinite distances from sources and detectors. The deflection in both the $\phi$ and $\theta$ directions is computed as power series of $M/r_0$ and $r_0/r_{\mathrm{s,d}}$, where $M,\,r_{\mathrm{s,d}}$ are the spacetime mass and source and detector radii respectively, and $r_0$ is the minimal radial coordinate of the trajectory. The coefficients of these series are simple trigonometric functions of $\theta_\mathrm{e}$, the extreme value of the $\theta$ coordinate of the trajectory. A set of exact gravitational lensing equations is used to solve for $r_0$ and $\theta_\mathrm{e}$ for given deviation angles $\delta\theta$ and $\delta\phi$ of the source, and two lensed images are always obtained. The apparent angles and their magnifications of these images, and the time delays between them are solved and their dependence on various parameters, especially spacetime spin $\hat{a}$ are analyzed in great detail. It is found that there generally exist two critical spacetime spin values that separate the case of signals reaching the detector from different sides of the $z$ axis from the cases in which the images appear from the same side in the celestial plane. Three potential applications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Breaking black-hole uniqueness at supermassive scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, all vacuum black holes are described by the Kerr solution. Beyond general relativity, there is a prevailing expectation that deviations from the Kerr solution increase with the horizon curvature. We challenge this expectation by showing that, in a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, black holes scalarize in a finite, adjustable window of black-hole masses, bounded from above and below. In this theory, there is an interplay between curvature scales and compactness, which we expect to protect neutron stars and other less compact objects from scalarization. In addition, this theory is the first to avoid the catastrophic instability of early-universe cosmology that affects previous scalarization models. In this theory, black-hole uniqueness can be broken at supermassive black-hole scales, while stellar-mass black holes remain well-described by the Kerr solution. To probe this scenario, observations targeting supermassive black holes are necessary.</description>

      <title>Worldtube puncture scheme for first- and second-order self-force calculations in the Fourier domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order gravitational self-force theory has recently led to the breakthrough calculation of ``first post-adiabatic'' (1PA) compact-binary waveforms [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 241402 (2023)]. The computations underlying those waveforms depend on a method of solving the perturbative second-order Einstein equation on a Schwarzschild background in the Fourier domain. In this paper we present that method, which involves dividing the domain into several regions. Different regions utilize different time slicings and allow for the use of ``punctures'' to tame sources and enforce physical boundary conditions. We demonstrate the method for Lorenz-gauge and Teukolsky equations in the relatively simple case of calculating parametric derivatives (``slow time derivatives'') of first-order fields, which are an essential input at second order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by interaction of gravitational waves and dark matters, we study the Bondi-Sachs formalism for Einstein massless scalar field with zero cosmological constant. We provide asymptotic expansions for the Bondi-Sachs metrics as well as the scalar fields and prove the peeling property. We also prove the positivity of the Bondi energy-momentum under condition $c=d=0$ at some retarded time $u_0$. This condition ensures that asymptotically null hypersurfaces near $u=u_0$ are asymptotically null initial data sets of order 2 and the positive energy theorem for null infinity can be applied.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy) and seeing (via VLBI imaging) BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <title>Multi-domain spectral method for self-force calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order self-force calculations will be critical for modelling extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, and they are now known to have high accuracy even for binaries with mass ratios $\sim 1:10$. Many of the challenges facing these calculations are related to slow convergence of spherical-harmonic (or spheroidal harmonic) mode sums in a region containing the small companion. In this paper, we begin to develop a multi-domain framework that can evade those problems. Building on recent work by Osburn and Nishimura, in the problematic region of spacetime we use a puncture scheme and decompose the punctured field equations into a basis of Fourier and azimuthal $m$ modes, avoiding a harmonic decomposition in the $\theta$ direction. Outside the problematic region, we allow for a complete spherical- or spheroidal-harmonic decomposition. As a demonstration, we implement this framework in the simple context of a scalar charge in circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Our implementation utilizes several recent advances: a spectral method in each region, hyperboloidal compactification, and an extremely high-order puncture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the construction of Alcubierre-Nat\'{a}rio class of warp drives to an infinite class of spacetimes with similar properties. This is achieved by utilising the Martel-Poisson charts which closely resembles the Weak Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand form for various background metrics (Mink, AdS, dS). The highlight of this construction is the non-flat intrinsic metric which in three dimensional spacetimes introduce conical singularities at the origin and in higher dimensions generates non-zero Ricci scalar for the spatial hypersurfaces away from the origin. We analyse the expansion/contraction of space and the (NEC) violations associated with these warp drives and find interesting scalings due to the global imprints of the conical defects. Other properties like tilting of light cones, event horizons and several generalisations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Off-equatorial deflections and gravitational lensing. II. In general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a general perturbative procedure to find the off-equatorial plane deflections in the weak deflection limit in general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, allowing the existence of the generalized Carter constant. Deflections of both null and timelike rays, with the finite distance effect of the source and detector taken into account, are obtained as dual series of $M/r_0$ and $r_0/r_{s,d}$. These deflections allow a set of exact gravitational lensing equations from which the images' apparent angular positions are solved. The method and general results are then applied to the Kerr-Newmann, Kerr-Sen, and rotating Simpson-Visser spacetimes to study the effect of the spin and characteristic (effective) charge of the spacetimes and the source altitude on the deflection angles and image apparent angles. It is found that, in general, both the spacetime spin and charge only affect the deflections from the second non-trivial order, while the source altitude influences the deflection from the leading order. Because of this, it is found that, in gravitational lensing in realistic situations, it is hard to measure the effects of the spacetime spin and charge from the images' apparent locations. We also presented the off-equatorial deflections in the rotating Bardeen, Hayward, Ghosh, and Tinchev black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicate a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background (CMB), weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>A waveform model for the missing quadrupole mode from black hole coalescence: memory effect and ringdown of the $(\ell=2,m=0)$ spherical harmonic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a model for the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic mode of the gravitational wave signal emitted by the coalescence of binary black holes, in particular, spin-aligned systems. This mode can be viewed as consisting of two components, gravitational wave memory and quasi-normal ringdown, which are both included in our model. Depending on the parameters of the binary and the sensitivity curve of the detector, but in particular for high masses, the ringdown part can contribute significantly to the signal-to-noise ratio. The model is constructed using the methods of the phenomenological waveforms program, and is calibrated to public numerical relativity data from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) waveforms catalog, with the analytical results derived from the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) balance laws. The code has been implemented as an extension to the computationally efficient IMRPhenomTHM model, it can therefore be used for computationally expensive applications such as Bayesian parameter estimation. The region of validity of our model in the parameter space is given by: $q\leq10$ and $\chi_{1},\chi_{2}\in[-1,1]$, and no restrictions apply in terms of the length of the waveforms.</description>

      <title>The Tolman VII Space-time in the Presence of a Charge and a Cosmological Constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tolman VII space-time is one of the few physically acceptable exact solutions in general relativity. In this paper, we derive a generalised Tolman VII solution which includes a charge and a cosmological constant. We analyse the spatial geometry of the solution and present conditions for zero and non-zero spatial curvature. We show that for a particular value of the boundary, the Tolman VII space-time can be matched to the charged Nariai space-time. This represents a new class of solutions interior to Nariai. Matching with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter space-time, we derive analytic expressions for the metric functions and the pressure. Using this, we show that the solution allows for trapped null geodesics for a broad range of values for the charge and the cosmological constant. We investigate a few physical properties and derive an equation of state for the fluid. Performing numerical fitting, we show that the fluid can be considered a polytrope with, $\Gamma \sim 2.4$. Finally, we analyse the energy conditions and conclude that the solution follows the basic physical acceptability criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Bianchi I geometry coupled to several species of comoving barotropic perfect fluids with a linear equation of state in the context of general relativity. The solution of the dynamics can be reduced to a quadrature, which can be explicitly performed in certain cases. In particular, we obtain the explicit solution for one species, as well as for two species, given their barotropic indices obey a certain relation. These solutions include and generalize different models studied in the literature. For completeness, we analyze all the different possible signs of the matter energy densities, and we obtain a particularly interesting model in which an exotic species produces a bounce of the scale factor, providing a singularity-free cosmology, and then decays to leave a nonexotic component as the dominant fluid for large volumes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Bianchi IX under the presence of matter: approximate Kasner map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to analyze the effects of the matter fields in the evolution of the Bianchi IX cosmology close to the singularity. Although the dynamics of this model is very involved, asymptotically, as the singularity is approached, it can be well approximated as a succession of Bianchi I periods connected by quick bounces against potential walls. Moreover, in such limit, matter fields (excluding stiff matter) are known to be subdominant with respect to the anisotropies. Therefore, by performing an expansion around small volumes, and assuming that the dominant matter contribution in this regime can be described as a barotropic perfect fluid with a linear equation of state, we obtain an approximate analytic solution of the dynamics. Then, we explicitly compute the form of the transition (Kasner) map that relates the pre- and post-bounce Bianchi I periods including the leading matter effects. As an important conclusion, we observe that generically the presence of matter leads to a post-bounce velocity with a lower deflection angle than in the vacuum case, and thus effectively increases the convex curvature of the potential walls. This effect may have important consequences in the chaotic nature of general relativity near spacelike singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure and basic physical properties of non-rotating dark energy stars in Ho$\Check{\text{r}}$ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The interior of propsed stellar structure is made of isotropic matter obeys extended Chaplygin gas EoS. The structure equations representing the state of hydrostatic equilibrium i.e., generalize TOV equation in HL gravity is numerically solved by using chosen realistic EoS. Next, we investigate the deviation of physical features of dark energy stars in HL gravity as compared with general relativity (GR). Such investigation is depicted by varying a parameter $\omega$, whereas for $\omega\rightarrow \infty$ HL coincide with GR. As a results, we find that necessary features of our stellar structure are significantly affected by $\omega$ in HL gravity specifically on the estimation of the maximum mass and corresponding predicted radius of the star. In conclusion, we can predict the existence of heavior massive dark energy stars in the context of HL gravity as compared with GR with not collapsing into a black hole. Moreover, we investigate the stability of our proposed stellar system. By integrating the modified perturbations equations in support of suitable boundary conditions at the center and the surface of the stellar object, we evaluate the frequencies and eigenfunctions corresponding to six lowest excited modes. Finally, we find that physically viable and stable dark energy stars can be successfully discussed in HL gravity by this study.</description>

      <title>A generative adversarial network for stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rapid stellar core-collapse waveform emulator built using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The DCGAN was trained on the Richers \textit{et al.~}\cite{richers:2017} waveform catalogue to learn the structure of rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-wave signals and generate realistic waveforms. We show that the DCGAN learns the distribution of the training data reasonably well, and that the waveform emulator produces signals that appear to have the key features of core-collapse, bounce, early post-bounce, and ringdown oscillations of the early proto-neutron star. The pre-trained DCGAN can therefore be used as a phenomenological model for rotating stellar core-collapse gravitational-waves.</description>

      <title>Signatures from the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency for rotating black holes in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative efficiency and jet power in the spacetime of a rotating black hole within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), which includes an additional LQG parameter. The results show that as the LQG parameter increases, the radiative efficiency decreases for slowly rotating black holes while it increases for rapidly rotating black holes. Furthermore, the jet power is found to increase for different black hole spins. With the observed data from the well-known sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS1915+105, we make some constraints on the black hole spin parameter and the LQG parameter. The presence of the LQG parameter broadens the allowed range of the black hole spin parameter for sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564 and GRO J1655-40. However, for the source GRS 1915+105, there is no overlap between the allowed parameter regions, which implies that the rotating LQG black hole cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency as in other black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We transcribe into the framework of the torsionful version of the {\epsilon}-formalism of Infeld and van der Waerden the world definition of the Weyl tensor for a curved spacetime that occurs in the realm of Einstein-Cartan's theory. The resulting expression shows us that it is not possible to attain any general condition for conformal flatness in such a spacetime even if wave functions for gravitons are eventually taken to vanish identically. A short discussion on the situation concerning the limiting case of general relativity is presented thereafter.</description>

      <title>Finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole and its perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole possesses nontrivial super-Lorentz charges compared with the standard one. This may impact the quasinormal modes of the black hole. Since the Einstein's equations are generally covariant, the quasinormal modes of a supertranslated black hole can be obtained by supertranslating the familiar results for a standard black hole. It turns out that the supertranslated quasinormal modes can be obtained by simply shifting the retarded time of the standard modes by an angle-dependent function parameterizing the supertranslation. Therefore, the supertranslated quasinormal modes oscillate at the same frequencies and decay at the same rates as the corresponding standard ones. The supertranslated metric is time translation invariant, but does not explicitly respect spherical symmetries, although it is implicitly rotationally symmetric. So the supertranslated perturbations can still be written as linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of the generalized angular momentum operators for the underlying rotational symmetry. With a suitably defined asymptotic parity transformation, any perturbation can be decomposed into the even and odd parity parts. Then, one may conclude that the isospectrality still holds. To detect such supertranslated quasinormal modes, one has to place multiple gravitational wave interferometers around the supertranslated black hole, and measure the differences in the time shifts between interferometers. Gravitational lensing may also be helpful in the same spirit.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of new general relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In this work, we focus on unveiling the degrees of freedom of the physically interesting types of NGR: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8, which contain the gravitational propagating degrees of freedom. First, we revisit the theory based on the gauge approach to gravity and reformulate the Lagrangian of the theory. Second, we review the irreducible decomposition of the theory while focusing on the Hamiltonian and the primary constraints in each type. Third, we perform the Dirac-Bergmann analysis to unveil the degrees of freedom of the theory in the case of Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. We find a novel new behavior of constraints in Type 8, which is classified as second-class but not to determine any Lagrange multipliers and to provide the gauge invariance of the theory under the satisfaction of a specific condition of the multipliers. The degrees of freedom of Type 2, Type 3, and Type 5 are unveiled as six, five, and seven, respectively. The degrees of freedom of Type 8 is either four under a specific condition to the Lagrange multipliers or six in the generic case. Finally, we conclude this work with several future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Noncanonical warm inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study extended noncanonical warm inflation to the nonminimal derivative coupling scenario. The fundamental equations, including the evolution equations and the slow roll equations of this new framework, were derived. The enlarged damping term, which encompasses both gravitationally enhanced friction and thermal damping, resulted in a well overdamped inflationary process, ensuring that the slow roll approximations can be satisfactorily satisfied. A linear stability analysis corroborated the viability of this approach, yielding significantly relaxed slow roll conditions within the context of noncanonical warm inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling. Subsequently, the density fluctuations in this new framework were analyzed, leading to approximately analytic results for the power spectrum, spectral index, and related quantities. Both the energy scale at horizon crossing and the tensor-to-scalar ratio decreased considerably because of the effects of thermal damping and nonminimal derivative coupling. The upper bound for field excursion remained safely sub-Planckian in this inflationary scenario. Thus we reached a successful and meaningful model to broad the scope of warm inflation.</description>

Abstract: This paper mainly aims to solve the Anti deSitter Black Holes (AdS BH) under the Barrow entropy under polytropic gas fluid, especially the Chaplygin Gas. First, we develop this last polytropic model in detail to then obtain the possible solutions and thermodynamic conditions on the Energy-Momentum and the Barrow Entropy for spacetimes of spatial dimension $D&gt;3$. Then, we focus on thermidynamic solutions and the different impacts on the Barrow entropy of the black hole, the temperature profile, the mass and the various physical quantities involved. Afterwards, we focus on the specific cases of the solutions of dimensions $D=4$ and $5$ in order to concretely test the models, especially from the point of view of the thermodynamic topology. Finally, we generalize everything by elaborating and testing the stability of the models to arrive at the thermal geometry of the AdS BH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a stellar-mass black hole around an intermediate-mass slowly rotating Kerr black hole in the presence of gravitational radiation and a dark matter halo. The stellar-mass companion will inspiral towards the central black hole while emitting gravitational waves. The evolution is affected by the dynamical friction force caused by the presence of dark matter surrounding the intermediate-mass black hole at the core. Previous studies have shown that the presence of dark matter can be deduced from the gravitational waveforms. We explore the combined effects of slow-rotation of the central black hole and the presence of the dark matter halo around it on the system's gravitational wave emission.</description>

Abstract: We question the existence of one-loop corrections to the large-scale power spectrum from small-scale modes in non-slow-roll dynamics which are not volume suppressed by the ratio of the short to long distance scales. One-loop contributions proportional to the long wavelength tree-level power spectrum, and not sharing this suppression, have appeared in studies involving interactions singled out by the non-slow-roll dynamics. In this context, we show the relevance of seemingly irrelevant interactions terms, such as the one provided by total derivative terms (boundary terms), and how they equally lead to non-volume suppressed contributions and exact cancellations.</description>

Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of solutions to a particular class of systems of linear wave equations, namely, of silent equations. We obtain asymptotic estimates of all orders for the solutions, and show that solutions are uniquely determined by the asymptotic data contained in the estimates. As an application, we then study solutions to the source free Maxwell's equations in Kasner spacetimes near the initial singularity. Our results allow us to obtain an asymptotic expansion for the potential of the electromagnetic field, and to show that the energy density of generic solutions blows up along generic timelike geodesics when approaching the singularity. The asymptotics we study correspond to the heuristics of the BKL conjecture, where the coefficients of the spatial derivative terms of the equations are expected to be small, and thus these terms are neglected in order to obtain the asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On the interacting dark energy scenarios $-$ the case for Hubble constant tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant $H_0$ is one of the important cosmological parameters measuring the expansion rate of our universe at present moment. Over the last couple of years, $H_0$ has created an enormous amount of debates interests in the astrophysical and cosmological communities for its different estimations at many standard deviations by different observational surveys. The recent estimation of $H_0$ from the cosmic microwave background observations by Planck within the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm is in tension with $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ confidence with SH0ES (Supernovae and $H_0$ for the Equation of State of dark energy) collaboration. As a result, revision of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has been suggested in various ways in order to examine whether such scenarios can solve this $H_0$ tension. Among the list of the proposed cosmological scenarios, in this chapter we focus on a generalized cosmological theory in which the dark components of the universe, namely, Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) are allowed to interact with each other in a non-gravitational way, widely known as the Interacting DE or Coupled DE scenarios. These interacting scenarios have received magnificent attention in the scientific community for their appealing consequences. Specifically, in the context of $H_0$ tension, it has been observed that the interacting DE scenarios can lead to higher values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) value, and consequently, the tension on $H_0$ can be either alleviated or solved. In this chapter we review various interacting DE scenarios and their roles in alleviating the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00129v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Integration-By-Parts (IBP) and differential equations methods to de Sitter correlators related to inflation. While massive correlators in de Sitter spacetime are usually regarded as highly intricate, we find they have remarkably hidden concise structures from the perspective of IBP. We find the factorization of the IBP relations of each vertex integral family corresponding to $\mathrm{d} \tau_i$ integration. Furthermore, with a smart construction of master integrals, the universal formulas for iterative reduction and $\mathrm{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary vertex integral family are presented and proved. These formulas dominate all tree-level de Sitter correlators and play a kernel role at the loop-level as well.</description>

Abstract: The physical phenomena seen by an observer are defined for a local inertial system that is subjective to the observer. Such a coordinate system is called a ``moving frame'' because it changes from time to time. However, unlike the Thomas precession, the Unruh-DeWitt detector has been discussed for a fixed frame. We discuss the Unruh-DeWitt detector by defining the vacuum for the moving frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the vierbeins and the exact WKB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window around 5 e-folds for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

      <title>General relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium disks around rotating neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modeling a relativistic disk around a compact object, the self-gravity of the disk is often neglected while it needs to be incorporated for more accurate descriptions in several circumstances. Extending the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu self-consistent field method, we present numerical models of a rapidly rotating neutron star with a self-gravitating disk in stationary equilibrium. In particular, our approach allows us to obtain numerical solutions involving a massive disk with the rest mass $O(10^{-1})-O(10^0) M_\odot$ closely attached to a rotating neutron star. We also assess the impact of self-gravity on the internal structure of the disk and the neutron star. These axisymmetric, stationary solutions can be employed for simulations involving the neutron star-disk system in the context of high-energy transients and gravitational wave emissions.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Signatures of Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes with Circumbinary Disks in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black holes may have circumbinary disks if formed through common-envelope evolution or within gaseous environments. Disks can drive binaries into wider and more eccentric orbits, while gravitational waves harden and circularise them. We combine cutting-edge evolution prescriptions for disk-driven binaries with well-known equations for gravitational-wave-driven evolution, and study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that binaries are driven by their disk to an equilibrium eccentricity, $0.2\lesssim e_\mathrm{eq} \lesssim0.5$, that dominates their evolution. Once they transition to the GW-dominated regime their eccentricity decreases rapidly; we find that stellar-mass binary black holes with long-lived disks will likely be observed in LISA with detectable eccentricities $\sim 10^{-2}$ at $0.01$ Hz, with the precise value closely correlating with the binary's initial mass ratio. This may lead stellar-mass binary black holes with CBDs observed in LISA to be confused with dynamically-formed binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Extremal Black Holes and the UV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been noted that deformations of extremal AdS black holes in four and higher dimensions are generically non-smooth or singular on the horizon. Further, it was found that certain deformations of asymptotically flat extremal black holes are marginal, causing the nature of the horizon to be strongly sensitive to UV corrections -- in particular, Wilson coefficients associated with consistent UV completions generically lead to worse behaviour on the horizon. In this work, we extend the discussion of deformed horizons in the presence of UV corrections to extremal charged black holes in AdS, where we find a tower of marginal perturbations for different black hole masses. We argue that the apparent UV sensitivity of marginal modes is, in fact, a feature of the UV theory which is correctly reproduced by the EFT, and illustrate this with explicit UV completions confirming the validity of the EFT. We demonstrate that the same holds for a scalar-Maxwell EFT with known UV completion. In the gravitational case, the sign of EFT corrections to marginal perturbations is generally connected with the signs implied by positivity bounds, with UV completions generically leading to worse behaviour on the horizon. We conjecture that this result is more generic, and use this to derive more general positivity bounds motivated by the weak gravity conjecture, which we illustrate with further evidence.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Dissipative $\Lambda$CDM model with causal sign-switching bulk viscous pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by considering dissipative effects within a causal viscous framework, and obtaining an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter remains a challenge in the literature. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by deriving a complete and original solution for the Hubble parameter by introducing a novel form for the bulk viscous coefficient associated with bulk viscous dark matter (vDM). A thorough analysis of the model is conducted by deriving theoretical constraints on the parameters and comparing the model with the latest observational data sets. Intriguingly, we find that the model predicts a sign-switching bulk viscous pressure, which facilitates both the early decelerated expansion and the late accelerated expansion of the universe. Also, the redshift at which the viscous pressure switches sign is found to be strongly correlated with the relaxation time parameter of the viscous fluid. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that, the model satisfies both the covariant and generalized second law of thermodynamics as well as the convexity condition for entropy. Additionally, we reconstructed the model by unifying viscous dark matter and dark energy into a single unified dark matter (UDM) component, and found that this unified model predicts identical dynamical evolution for the Universe, while satisfying the necessary near-equilibrium condition throughout that evolution (both in early and late phases).</description>

      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes: collisional dynamics, binaries, and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

      <title>Spectral energy distribution of radiation from star-like sources in the expanding Universe and once more about Olbers' paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of the expansion of the Universe on the formation of total spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium. Assuming the same proper thermal spectrum of sources, we show how the expansion of the Universe changes the nature of the energy distribution of the thermal spectrum: a decrease of the energy density in the Wien range and an increase in the Rayleigh--Jeans range with increasing the redshift of the bulk filled by sources. This is due to the cosmological redshift and the growing contribution of large number of distant sources. The numerical estimations also illustrate the main factors that resolve the Olbers' paradox in the expanding Universe: i) the particle horizon, ii) the finiteness of the volume filled by luminous objects, and iii) the cosmological redshift. Applying the obtained expressions to the epoch of reionization made it possible to estimate the concentration of objects of various classes (stars, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies) necessary for complete reionization of hydrogen at $z=6$. It is shown that even a small part of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies with a thermal spectrum of moderate temperature, from those predicted by Press-Schechter formalism and its improvements, is able to completely reionize hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at $z=6$.</description>

      <title>The primordial non-Gaussianities for non-singular Horndeski cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have acquired and analyzed the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and the corresponding non-Gaussianities in the particular model of the contracting Universe with strong gravity in the past within the framework of the Horndeski theory. The found shape function of the bispectrum did not correspond to the widely used local, equilateral, orthogonal or enfolded shapes. We also evaluate non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ for different wave numbers $\vec{k}_1$, $\vec{k}_2$, $\vec{k}_3$ configurations. The convenient ones in our case are: (i) $k_1=k_2$, $k_3\to 0$ (local configuration of wave numbers); (ii) $k_1=k_2=k_3$ (equilateral configuration); (iii) the enfolded one, where $k_1=k_2+k_3$, which is a linear combination of the equilateral and orthogonal configurations. For each separate configuration (local, equilateral, and enfolded) it is possible to satisfy the current observational bounds for non-linear parameter even under the restrictions of the applicability of regime, where the background evolution and perturbations are legitimately described within classical field theory and weakly coupled quantum theory at all times. However, one can not select the parameters of the model so that all three non-linear parameters $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{local}}$, $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{equil}}$, and $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{enfold}}$ would simultaneously satisfy the acceptable observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field can decrease radius of NS. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field increases the compactness and deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>IR finite correlation functions in de Sitter space, a smooth massless limit, and an autonomous equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore two-point and four-point correlation functions of a massive scalar field on the flat de Sitter background in the long-wavelength approximation. By employing the Yang-Feldman-type equation, we compute the two-point correlation function up to the three-loop level and the four-point correlation function up to the two-loop one. In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar field based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the vacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but results in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part. Our elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive scalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known two-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one. Remarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field coincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear physical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach, and the Hartree-Fock approximation. At last, we have constructed a renormalization group-inspired autonomous equation for the two-point correlation function. Integrating its approximate version, one obtains the non-analytic expression with respect to a self-interaction coupling constant $\lambda$. That solution reproduces the correct perturbative series up to the two-loop level. At the late-time limit, it almost coincides with the result of Starobinsky's stochastic approach in the whole interval of a new dimensionless parameter $0 \leq \tfrac{\pi^2 m^4}{3\lambda H^4} &lt; \infty$.</description>
