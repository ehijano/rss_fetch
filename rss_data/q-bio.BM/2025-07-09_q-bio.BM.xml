      <title>Predicting mutational effects on protein binding from folding energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of mutational effects on protein-protein binding energies is an open problem with applications in structural biology and therapeutic design. Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but, presumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform computationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited binding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical force-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up.</description>

      <title>Frustration, dynamics and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The controlled dissipation of chemical potentials is the fundamental way cells make a living. Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.</description>
