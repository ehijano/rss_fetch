      <title>Evaluating Supply Chain Resilience During Pandemic Using Agent-based Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent pandemics have highlighted vulnerabilities in our global economic systems, especially supply chains. Possible future pandemic raises a dilemma for businesses owners between short-term profitability and long-term supply chain resilience planning. In this study, we propose a novel agent-based simulation model integrating extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model and supply and demand economic model to evaluate supply chain resilience strategies during pandemics. Using this model, we explore a range of supply chain resilience strategies under pandemic scenarios using in silico experiments. We find that a balanced approach to supply chain resilience performs better in both pandemic and non-pandemic times compared to extreme strategies, highlighting the importance of preparedness in the form of a better supply chain resilience. However, our analysis shows that the exact supply chain resilience strategy is hard to obtain for each firm and is relatively sensitive to the exact profile of the pandemic and economic state at the beginning of the pandemic. As such, we used a machine learning model that uses the agent-based simulation to estimate a near-optimal supply chain resilience strategy for a firm. The proposed model offers insights for policymakers and businesses to enhance supply chain resilience in the face of future pandemics, contributing to understanding the trade-offs between short-term gains and long-term sustainability in supply chain management before and during pandemics.</description>

      <title>Feature-based Federated Transfer Learning: Communication Efficiency, Robustness and Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose feature-based federated transfer learning as a novel approach to improve communication efficiency by reducing the uplink payload by multiple orders of magnitude compared to that of existing approaches in federated learning and federated transfer learning. Specifically, in the proposed feature-based federated learning, we design the extracted features and outputs to be uploaded instead of parameter updates. For this distributed learning model, we determine the required payload and provide comparisons with the existing schemes. Subsequently, we analyze the robustness of feature-based federated transfer learning against packet loss, data insufficiency, and quantization. Finally, we address privacy considerations by defining and analyzing label privacy leakage and feature privacy leakage, and investigating mitigating approaches. For all aforementioned analyses, we evaluate the performance of the proposed learning scheme via experiments on an image classification task and a natural language processing task to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>BonnBot-I Plus: A Bio-diversity Aware Precise Weed Management Robotic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the critical tasks of plant protection in arable farms, addressing a modern challenge in agriculture: integrating ecological considerations into the operational strategy of precision weeding robots like \bbot. This article presents the recent advancements in weed management algorithms and the real-world performance of \bbot\ at the University of Bonn's Klein-Altendorf campus. We present a novel Rolling-view observation model for the BonnBot-Is weed monitoring section which leads to an average absolute weeding performance enhancement of $3.4\%$. Furthermore, for the first time, we show how precision weeding robots could consider bio-diversity-aware concerns in challenging weeding scenarios. We carried out comprehensive weeding experiments in sugar-beet fields, covering both weed-only and mixed crop-weed situations, and introduced a new dataset compatible with precision weeding. Our real-field experiments revealed that our weeding approach is capable of handling diverse weed distributions, with a minimal loss of only $11.66\%$ attributable to intervention planning and $14.7\%$ to vision system limitations highlighting required improvements of the vision system.</description>
