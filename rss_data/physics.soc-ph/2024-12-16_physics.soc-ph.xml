      <title>Correlation between transition probability and network structure in epidemic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In discrete-time dynamics, it is frequently assumed that the transition probabilities (e.g., the recovery probability) are independent of the network structure. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this claim in large time intervals. This paper presents the nonlinear relations between the rates (in continuous-time dynamics) and probabilities of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on annealed and static networks. It is shown that the transition probabilities are affected not only by the rates and the time interval, but also by the network structure. The correctness of the nonlinear relations on networks is verified based on theoretical calculation and Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Community Detection via Quasi-Stationary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral clustering is a widely used method for community detection in networks. We focus on a semi-supervised community detection scenario in the Partially Labeled Stochastic Block Model (PL-SBM) with two balanced communities, where a fixed portion of labels is known. Our approach leverages random walks in which the revealed nodes in each community act as absorbing states. By analyzing the quasi-stationary distributions associated with these random walks, we construct a classifier that distinguishes the two communities by examining differences in the associated eigenvectors. We establish upper and lower bounds on the error rate for a broad class of quasi-stationary algorithms, encompassing both spectral and voting-based approaches. In particular, we prove that this class of algorithms can achieve the optimal error rate in the connected regime. We further demonstrate empirically that our quasi-stationary approach improves performance on both real-world and simulated datasets.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity in Interbank Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted reciprocity between two agents can be defined as the minimum of sending and receiving value in their bilateral relationship. In financial networks, such reciprocity characterizes the importance of individual banks as both liquidity absorber and provider, a feature typically attributed to large, intermediating dealer banks. In this paper we develop an exponential random graph model that can account for reciprocal links of each node simultaneously on the topological as well as on the weighted level. We provide an exact expression for the normalizing constant and thus a closed-form solution for the graph probability distribution. Applying this statistical null model to Italian interbank data, we find that before the great financial crisis (i) banks displayed significantly more weighted reciprocity compared to what the lower-order network features (size and volume distributions) would predict (ii) with a disappearance of this deviation once the early periods of the crisis set in, (iii) a trend which can be attributed in particular to smaller banks (dis)engaging in bilateral high-value trading relationships. Moreover, we show that neglecting reciprocal links and weights can lead to spurious findings of triadic relationships. As the hierarchical structure in the network is found to be compatible with its transitive but not with its intransitive triadic sub-graphs, the interbank market seems to be well-characterized by a hierarchical core-periphery structure enhanced by non-hierarchical reciprocal trading relationships.</description>
