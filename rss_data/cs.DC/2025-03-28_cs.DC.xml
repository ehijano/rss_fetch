      <title>Advances in Semantic Patching for HPC-oriented Refactorings with Coccinelle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the most energy-efficient hardware platforms for floating point-intensive calculations (also known as High Performance Computing, or HPC) are graphical processing units (GPUs). However, porting existing scientific codes to GPUs can be far from trivial. This article summarizes our recent advances in enabling machine-assisted, HPC-oriented refactorings with reference to existing APIs and programming idioms available in C and C++. The tool we are extending and using for the purpose is called Coccinelle. An important workflow we aim to support is that of writing and maintaining tersely written application code, while deferring circumstantial, ad-hoc, performance-related changes to specific, separate rules called semantic patches. GPUs currently offer very limited debugging facilities. The approach we are developing aims at preserving intelligibility, longevity, and relatedly, debuggability of existing code on CPUs, while at the same time enabling HPC-oriented code evolutions such as introducing support for GPUs, in a scriptable and possibly parametric manner. This article sketches a number of self-contained use cases, including further HPC-oriented cases which are independent from GPUs.</description>

      <title>History-Independent Concurrent Hash Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A history-independent data structure does not reveal the history of operations applied to it, only its current logical state, even if its internal state is examined. This paper studies history-independent concurrent dictionaries, in particular, hash tables, and establishes inherent bounds on their space requirements.
  This paper shows that there is a lock-free history-independent concurrent hash table, in which each memory cell stores two elements and two bits, based on Robin Hood hashing. Our implementation is linearizable, and uses the shared memory primitive LL/SC. The expected amortized step complexity of the hash table is $O(c)$, where $c$ is an upper bound on the number of concurrent operations that access the same element, assuming the hash table is not overpopulated. We complement this positive result by showing that even if we have only two concurrent processes, no history-independent concurrent dictionary that supports sets of any size, with wait-free membership queries and obstruction-free insertions and deletions, can store only two elements of the set and a constant number of bits in each memory cell. This holds even if the step complexity of operations on the dictionary is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Scalability Evaluation of HPC Multi-GPU Training for ECG-based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models requires extensive processing, made possible by many high-performance computing resources. This study compares multi-node and multi-GPU environments for training large language models of electrocardiograms. It provides a detailed mapping of current frameworks for distributed deep learning in multinode and multi-GPU settings, including Horovod from Uber, DeepSpeed from Microsoft, and the built-in distributed capabilities of PyTorch and TensorFlow. We compare various multi-GPU setups for different dataset configurations, utilizing multiple HPC nodes independently and focusing on scalability, speedup, efficiency, and overhead. The analysis leverages HPC infrastructure with SLURM, Apptainer (Singularity) containers, CUDA, PyTorch, and shell scripts to support training workflows and automation. We achieved a sub-linear speedup when scaling the number of GPUs, with values of 1.6x for two and 1.9x for four.</description>

      <title>Cloud Resource Allocation with Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a convex optimization framework for overcoming the limitations of Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler by intelligently allocating diverse cloud resources while minimizing costs and fragmentation. Current Kubernetes scaling mechanisms are restricted to homogeneous scaling of existing node types, limiting cost-performance optimization possibilities. Our matrix-based model captures resource demands, costs, and capacity constraints in a unified mathematical framework. A key contribution is our logarithmic approximation to the indicator function, which enables dynamic node type selection while maintaining problem convexity. Our approach balances cost optimization with operational complexity through interior-point methods. Experiments with real-world Kubernetes workloads demonstrate reduced costs and improved resource utilization compared to conventional Cluster Autoscaler strategies that can only scale up or down existing node pools.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-DNN Inference on Mobile Devices through Heterogeneous Processor Co-Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across diverse industries, driving demand for mobile device support. However, existing mobile inference frameworks often rely on a single processor per model, limiting hardware utilization and causing suboptimal performance and energy efficiency. Expanding DNN accessibility on mobile platforms requires adaptive, resource-efficient solutions to meet rising computational needs without compromising functionality. Parallel inference of multiple DNNs on heterogeneous processors remains challenging. Some works partition DNN operations into subgraphs for parallel execution across processors, but these often create excessive subgraphs based only on hardware compatibility, increasing scheduling complexity and memory overhead.
  To address this, we propose an Advanced Multi-DNN Model Scheduling (ADMS) strategy for optimizing multi-DNN inference on mobile heterogeneous processors. ADMS constructs an optimal subgraph partitioning strategy offline, balancing hardware operation support and scheduling granularity, and uses a processor-state-aware algorithm to dynamically adjust workloads based on real-time conditions. This ensures efficient workload distribution and maximizes processor utilization. Experiments show ADMS reduces multi-DNN inference latency by 4.04 times compared to vanilla frameworks.</description>

      <title>PilotANN: Memory-Bounded GPU Acceleration for Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) has become fundamental to modern deep learning applications, having gained particular prominence through its integration into recent generative models that work with increasingly complex datasets and higher vector dimensions. Existing CPU-only solutions, even the most efficient graph-based ones, struggle to meet these growing computational demands, while GPU-only solutions face memory constraints. As a solution, we propose PilotANN, a hybrid CPU-GPU system for graph-based ANNS that utilizes both CPU's abundant RAM and GPU's parallel processing capabilities. Our approach decomposes the graph traversal process of top-$k$ search into three stages: GPU-accelerated subgraph traversal using SVD-reduced vectors, CPU refinement and precise search using complete vectors. Furthermore, we introduce fast entry selection to improve search starting points while maximizing GPU utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that PilotANN achieves $3.9 - 5.4 \times$ speedup in throughput on 100-million scale datasets, and is able to handle datasets up to $12 \times$ larger than the GPU memory. We offer a complete open-source implementation at https://github.com/ytgui/PilotANN.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous BFT Consensus Made Wireless</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols, known for their robustness in unpredictable environments without relying on timing assumptions, are becoming increasingly vital for wireless applications. While these protocols have proven effective in wired networks, their adaptation to wireless environments presents significant challenges. Asynchronous BFT consensus, characterized by its N parallel consensus components (e.g., asynchronous Byzantine agreement, reliable broadcast), suffers from high message complexity, leading to network congestion and inefficiency, especially in resource-constrained wireless networks. Asynchronous Byzantine agreement (ABA) protocols, a foundational component of asynchronous BFT, require careful balancing of message complexity and cryptographic overhead to achieve efficient implementation in wireless settings. Additionally, the absence of dedicated testbeds for asynchronous wireless BFT consensus protocols hinders development and performance evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a consensus batching protocol (ConsensusBatcher), which supports both vertical and horizontal batching of multiple parallel consensus components. We leverage ConsensusBatcher to adapt three asynchronous BFT consensus protocols (HoneyBadgerBFT, BEAT, and Dumbo) from wired networks to resource-constrained wireless networks. To evaluate the performance of ConsensusBatcher-enabled consensus protocols in wireless environments, we develop and open-source a testbed for deployment and performance assessment of these protocols. Using this testbed, we demonstrate that ConsensusBatcher-based consensus reduces latency by 48% to 59% and increases throughput by 48% to 62% compared to baseline consensus protocols.</description>

      <title>OCEP: An Ontology-Based Complex Event Processing Framework for Healthcare Decision Support in Big Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential expansion of real-time data streams across multiple domains needs the development of effective event detection, correlation, and decision-making systems. However, classic Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems struggle with semantic heterogeneity, data interoperability, and knowledge driven event reasoning in Big Data environments. To solve these challenges, this research work presents an Ontology based Complex Event Processing (OCEP) framework, which utilizes semantic reasoning and Big Data Analytics to improve event driven decision support. The proposed OCEP architecture utilizes ontologies to support reasoning to event streams. It ensures compatibility with different data sources and lets you find the events based on the context. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) organizes event data, and SPARQL query enables rapid event reasoning and retrieval. The approach is implemented within the Hadoop environment, which consists of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalable storage and Apache Kafka for real-time CEP based event execution. We perform a real-time healthcare analysis and case study to validate the model, utilizing IoT sensor data for illness monitoring and emergency responses. This OCEP framework successfully integrates several event streams, leading to improved early disease detection and aiding doctors in decision-making. The result shows that OCEP predicts event detection with an accuracy of 85%. This research work utilizes an OCEP to solve the problems with semantic interoperability and correlation of complex events in Big Data analytics. The proposed architecture presents an intelligent, scalable and knowledge driven event processing framework for healthcare based decision support.</description>

      <title>Robust DNN Partitioning and Resource Allocation Under Uncertain Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In edge intelligence systems, deep neural network (DNN) partitioning and data offloading can provide real-time task inference for resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot be precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively. The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning Against Poisoning Attacks: A GAN-Based Defense Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices without sharing raw data, but it remains vulnerable to poisoning attacks that compromise model integrity. Existing defenses often rely on external datasets or predefined heuristics (e.g. number of malicious clients), limiting their effectiveness and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a privacy-preserving defense framework that leverages a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic data at the server for authenticating client updates, eliminating the need for external datasets. Our framework is scalable, adaptive, and seamlessly integrates into FL workflows. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its robust performance against a variety of poisoning attacks, achieving high True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) of malicious and benign clients, respectively, while maintaining model accuracy. The proposed framework offers a practical and effective solution for securing federated learning systems.</description>

      <title>AllReduce Scheduling with Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AllReduce is a technique in distributed computing which saw use in many critical applications of deep learning. Existing methods of AllReduce scheduling oftentimes lack flexibility due to being topology-specific or relying on extensive handcrafted designs that require domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we aim to alleviate this inflexibility by proposing a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based pipeline that can generate AllReduce scheduling for various network topologies without topology-specific design features. The flow scheduling module of this pipeline consists of two hierarchically-structured DRL policies that work cooperatively to find optimal scheduling. We showcase the performance of our method compared to the baseline methods on three topologies: BCube, DCell, and Jellyfish. Finally, we contributed a Python-based simulation environment simulating AllReduce scheduling on these network topologies.</description>

      <title>MLDSE: Scaling Design Space Exploration Infrastructure for Multi-Level Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently support large-scale NNs, multi-level hardware, leveraging advanced integration and interconnection technologies, has emerged as a promising solution to counter the slowdown of Moore's law. However, the vast design space of such hardware, coupled with the complexity of their spatial hierarchies and organizations, introduces significant challenges for design space exploration (DSE). Existing DSE tools, which rely on predefined hardware templates to explore parameters for specific architectures, fall short in exploring diverse organizations, spatial hierarchies, and architectural polymorphisms inherent in multi-level hardware. To address these limitations, we present Multi-Level Design Space Exploror (MLDSE), a novel infrastructure for domain-specific DSE of multi-level hardware. MLDSE introduces three key innovations from three basic perspectives of DSE: 1) Modeling: MLDSE introduces a hardware intermediate representation (IR) that can recursively model diverse multi-level hardware with composable elements at various granularities. 2) Mapping: MLDSE provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal mapping IR and mapping primitives, facilitating the mapping strategy exploration on multi-level hardware, especially synchronization and cross-level communication; 3) Simulation: MLDSE supports universal simulator generation based on task-level event-driven simulation mechanism. It features a hardware-consistent scheduling algorithm that can handle general task-level resource contention. Through experiments on LLM workloads, we demonstrate MLDSE's unique capability to perform three-tier DSE spanning architecture, hardware parameter, and mapping.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Large Model Training through Overlapped Activation Recomputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large model training often uses recomputation to alleviate memory pressure and pipelines to exploit the parallelism of data, tensors, and devices. However, existing recomputation approaches may incur high overhead when training real-world models, as they are executed on demand in the critical training path. In this paper, we present Lynx, a new recomputation framework to reduce overhead by overlapping recomputation with communication in training pipelines. To reduce the large search space for recomputation strategies, we propose a heuristic-based recomputation scheduling algorithm, which is based on the observation that there are identical structures in large DNN models so that we can apply the same scheduling policy to all such structures. Additionally, we propose a recomputation-aware model partitioning method to balance each stage's execution time for improved training throughput. Our comprehensive evaluation using GPT models with 1.3B-23B parameters shows that Lynx outperforms existing recomputation approaches by up to 1.37x.</description>

      <title>Renaming in distributed certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local certification is the area of distributed network computing asking the following question: How to certify to the nodes of a network that a global property holds, if they are limited to a local verification?
  In this area, it is often essential to have identifiers, that is, unique integers assigned to the nodes. In this short paper, we show how to reduce the range of the identifiers, in three different settings. More precisely, we show how to rename identifiers in the classical local certification setting, when we can (resp.\ cannot) choose the new identifiers, and we show how a global certificate can help to encode very compactly a new identifier assignment that is not injective in general, but still useful in applications.
  We conclude with a number of applications of these results: For every $\ell$, there are local certification schemes for the properties of having clique number at most $\ell$, having diameter at most $\ell$, and having independence number at most~2, with certificates of size $O(n)$. We also show that there is a global certification scheme for bipartiteness with certificates of size $O(n)$. All these results are optimal.</description>

Abstract: The growing scale of data requires efficient memory subsystems with large memory capacity and high memory performance. Disaggregated architecture has become a promising solution for today's cloud and edge computing for its scalability and elasticity. As a critical part of disaggregation, disaggregated memory faces many design challenges in many dimensions, including hardware scalability, architecture structure, software system design, application programmability, resource allocation, power management, etc. These challenges inspire a number of novel solutions at different system levels to improve system efficiency. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of disaggregated memory, including the methodology and technologies of disaggregated memory system foundation, optimization, and management. We study the technical essentials of disaggregated memory systems and analyze them from the hardware, architecture, system, and application levels. Then, we compare the design details of typical cross-layer designs on disaggregated memory. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of future disaggregated memory works that serve better for next-generation elastic and efficient datacenters.</description>

      <title>TileLink: Generating Efficient Compute-Communication Overlapping Kernels using Tile-Centric Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks. These models often necessitate distributed systems for efficient training and inference. The fundamental building blocks for distributed model execution are intra-layer parallel operators. The most effective approach to enhancing the performance of intra-layer parallel operators involves overlapping computation with communication. The overlapping can be achieved through either operator decomposition or kernel fusion. While decomposing operators is straightforward to implement, it often results in suboptimal performance. On the other hand, fusing communication kernels with compute kernels demands significant expertise and is error-prone.
  In this paper, we propose TileLink to enable efficient compilation and generation of overlapped compute-communication kernels. TileLink is composed of frontend and backend. In the frontend, TileLink decouples the design space of communication and computation, linking these two parts via tile-centric primitives. In the backend, TileLink translates these primitives into low-level communication instructions, integrating the communication and computation components to achieve overlapped execution. In experiments, TileLink achieves from $1.17\times$ to $20.76\times$ speedup to non-overlapping baseline and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art overlapping libraries on GPUs.</description>

      <title>Unlearning during Learning: An Efficient Federated Machine Unlearning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has garnered significant attention as a distributed machine learning paradigm. To facilitate the implementation of the right to be forgotten, the concept of federated machine unlearning (FMU) has also emerged. However, current FMU approaches often involve additional time-consuming steps and may not offer comprehensive unlearning capabilities, which renders them less practical in real FL scenarios. In this paper, we introduce FedAU, an innovative and efficient FMU framework aimed at overcoming these limitations. Specifically, FedAU incorporates a lightweight auxiliary unlearning module into the learning process and employs a straightforward linear operation to facilitate unlearning. This approach eliminates the requirement for extra time-consuming steps, rendering it well-suited for FL. Furthermore, FedAU exhibits remarkable versatility. It not only enables multiple clients to carry out unlearning tasks concurrently but also supports unlearning at various levels of granularity, including individual data samples, specific classes, and even at the client level. We conducted extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets to evaluate the performance of FedAU. The results demonstrate that FedAU effectively achieves the desired unlearning effect while maintaining model accuracy. Our code is availiable at https://github.com/Liar-Mask/FedAU.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of DAI: A Logic-Based Approach to Stablecoin Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies. Despite their growing prominence, many stablecoins have struggled to consistently meet stability expectations, and their underlying mechanisms often remain opaque and challenging to analyze. This paper focuses on the DAI stablecoin, which combines crypto-collateralization and algorithmic mechanisms. We propose a formal logic-based framework for representing the policies and operations of DAI, implemented in Prolog and released as open-source software. Our framework enables detailed analysis and simulation of DAI's stability mechanisms, providing a foundation for understanding its robustness and identifying potential vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>A Selective Homomorphic Encryption Approach for Faster Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning method that supports training models on decentralized devices or servers, where each holds its local data, removing the need for data exchange. This approach is especially useful in healthcare, as it enables training on sensitive data without needing to share them. The nature of federated learning necessitates robust security precautions due to data leakage concerns during communication. To address this issue, we propose a new approach that employs selective encryption, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and bit-wise scrambling to minimize data leakage while achieving good execution performance. Our technique , FAS (fast and secure federated learning) is used to train deep learning models on medical imaging data. We implemented our technique using the Flower framework and compared with a state-of-the-art federated learning approach that also uses selective homomorphic encryption. Our experiments were run in a cluster of eleven physical machines to create a real-world federated learning scenario on different datasets. We observed that our approach is up to 90\% faster than applying fully homomorphic encryption on the model weights. In addition, we can avoid the pretraining step that is required by our competitor and can save up to 46% in terms of total execution time. While our approach was faster, it obtained similar security results as the competitor.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of the Impact of Federated Learning on Machine Learning Model Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed ML model training on private user data at the global scale. Despite the potential of FL demonstrated in many domains, an in-depth view of its impact on model accuracy remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate, systematically, how this learning paradigm can affect the accuracy of state-of-the-art ML models for a variety of ML tasks. We present an empirical study that involves various data types: text, image, audio, and video, and FL configuration knobs: data distribution, FL scale, client sampling, and local and global computations. Our experiments are conducted in a unified FL framework to achieve high fidelity, with substantial human efforts and resource investments. Based on the results, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of FL, and highlight challenging scenarios where applying FL degrades the accuracy of the model drastically and identify cases where the impact is negligible. The detailed and extensive findings can benefit practical deployments and future development of FL.</description>
