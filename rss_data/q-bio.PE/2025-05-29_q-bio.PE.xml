      <title>Phase transitions in the Prisoner's Dilemma game on the Barab\'asi-Albert graph with participation cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of the maintenance cost of social links on cooperative behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma game on the Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network with a pairwise stochastic imitation. We show by means of Monte Carlo simulations and pair approximation that the cooperation frequency changes abruptly from an almost full cooperation to a much smaller value when we increase the cost of maintaining links. In the critical region, the stationary distribution is bi-modal and the system oscillates between two states: the state with almost full cooperation and one with coexisting strategies. We show that the critical region shrinks with the increasing size of the population. However, the expected time the system spends in a metastable state before switching to the other one does not change as a function of the system's size, which precludes the existence of two stationary states in the thermodynamic limit of the infinite population.</description>

      <title>Effect of the degree of an initial mutant in Moran processes in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of the mutant's degree on the fixation probability, extinction and fixation times, in the Moran process on Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and Barab\'{a}si-Albert graphs. We performed stochastic simulations and use mean-field type approximations to obtain analytical formulas. We showed that the initial placement of a mutant has a significant impact on the fixation probability and extinction time, while it has no effect on the fixation time. In both types of graphs, an increase in the degree of a initial mutant results in a decreased fixation probability and a shorter time to extinction.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of phylogenetic systems and species of electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03431v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe new spaces and maps. Our graphical map is a visual and numerical correspondence between spaces of circular electrical networks and circular planar split systems. When restricted to the planar circular electrical case, this graphical map finds the split system uniquely associated with the Kalmanson resistance distance of the dual network, matching the induced split system familiar from phylogenetics. This correspondence is extended to compactifications of the respective spaces, taking cactus networks to the cactus split systems defined herein. The graphical map preserves both network components and cactus structure, allowing an elegant enumeration of induced phylogenetic split systems via combinatorial species. We introduce the global spaces of circular planar electrical networks and circular split systems. These new spaces are also CW complexes, but the 0-cells of each are counted by the Bell numbers as opposed to the Catalan numbers. As species, the two sorts of global cacti are seen to be compositions in complementary ways.</description>
