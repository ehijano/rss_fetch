      <title>Evolving the Loeb Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a differential formulation of the Loeb Scale that extends the original static framework into a radially evolving, real time classification scheme for interstellar objects. By promoting each anomaly metric to a function of heliocentric distance and introducing a relaxation equation for the effective score, our method incorporates memory, hysteresis and predictive capability. This allows us to have early, stable forecasts of an object's eventual Loeb level based on sparse data obtained at large distances, which is more helpful to quantify its true nature when near Earth.</description>

      <title>The next frontier in exoplanet science: Imaging our neighbouring planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission and eclipse spectroscopy have been invaluable tools for the characterisation of extrasolar planet atmospheres. While they will continue to provide many new insights and discoveries in the decade(s) to come, these methods are running up against sources of stellar noise from stellar surface inhomogeneities and variability. In this white paper we discuss how the next steps in the characterisation of small, temperate rocky planets requires high-contrast imaging, making the planetary systems around our closest neighbouring stars the new frontier in exoplanet science. The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) will be at the forefront of this quest. The Planetary Camera and Spectrograph (PCS) on ESO's ELT and GmagAO-X on the GMT are planned to become operational in the 2035-2040 time-frame, allowing the characterisation of up to dozen(s) of rocky planets around nearby red dwarf stars. We discuss what role there will be still to play for ground-based exoplanet characterisation in the era of the space-borne Habitable Worlds Observatory and LIFE missions.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging characterization of cool gaseous planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cool gas giant exoplanets, particularly those with properties similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn, remain poorly characterized due to current observational limitations. This white paper outlines the transformative science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to directly image and spectroscopically characterize a broad range of gaseous exoplanets with effective temperatures below 400 K. The study focuses on determining key atmospheric properties, including molecular composition, cloud and haze characteristics, and temperature structure, across planets of varying sizes and orbital separations. Leveraging reflected light spectroscopy and polarimetry, HWO will enable comparative planetology of cool gas giants orbiting both solar-type and M-dwarf stars, bridging the observational gap between hot exoplanets and Solar System giants. We present observational requirements and survey strategies necessary to uncover correlations between atmospheric properties and planetary or stellar parameters. This effort will establish critical constraints on planetary formation, cloud microphysics, and the role of photochemistry under diverse irradiation conditions. The unique capabilities of HWO will make it the first facility capable of characterizing true exo-Jupiters in reflected light, thus offering an unprecedented opportunity to place the Solar System in a broader galactic context.</description>

      <title>How Mass Flows Through Accretion Discs: A Spectral-Timing Vision for the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how mass and angular momentum flow through accretion discs remains a fundamental unsolved problem in astrophysics. Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wavelength Observations of the Active Sun: Unveiling the Origins of Space Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Societal dependence on space-based services demands major advances in predicting the impacts of eruptive solar events. Millimeter-wavelength observations offer uniquely direct access to the time-dependent physical conditions in the atmospheric layers of the Sun where these events originate. A facility capable of full-disk, high-cadence, multi-frequency imaging would provide a transformative view of the Sun and its influence on the heliosphere. AtLAST is ideally suited to deliver this capability, and to establish a European leadership role in advancing the scientific foundations that will enable reliable, operational space-weather forecasting for the first time.</description>

      <title>The search for dark matter axions from neutron stars in the inner parsecs of the Milky Way with AtLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetospheres of neutron stars in the Galactic Center provide an exceptional environment to search for dark matter axions through their resonant conversion into photons. The combination of extreme magnetic fields and high dark matter density in this region creates ideal conditions for axion-photon conversion across the centimetre-to-submillimetre wavelength range. Detecting the cumulative emission from these neutron star populations demands a facility with unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution, and broad frequency coverage in the submillimetre domain, capabilities essential to explore a previously inaccessible region of axion parameter space.</description>

      <title>Atangana-Baleanu Regularized Wavelet Compression For Astronomical Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical light curves are noisy and irregular, so compression must reduce size without erasing weak transients. We propose a fractional wavelet compression method where wavelet coefficients are regularized via an Atangana Baleanu Caputo derivative with a nonsingular Mittag Leffler kernel. The induced long memory smoothing suppresses noise while preserving coherent transits, flares and oscillations. We give the coefficient level formulation, an efficient implementation, and comparisons with classical discrete wavelet thresholding, showing competitive compression with improved retention of low-amplitude events.</description>

      <title>Detection and characterisation of submm transient sources with a large single-dish telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the time-variable astronomical sky at submm wavelengths is rapidly becoming more feasible with large sky surveys by Cosmic Microwave Background telescopes with tens of thousands of detectors. Observations with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole Telescope have already detected some transients, and Simons Observatory and CCAT are expected to detect many more in the near future. Follow-up observations to characterise these transients, and surveying to uncovering fainter populations, will need high sensitivity and large fields of view at submm wavelengths, which could be provided by large single dish telescopes such as AtLAST.</description>

      <title>The multiple facets of millisecond pulsar binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsar (MSP) binaries are unique laboratories for studying matter and radiation under extreme conditions that are unattainable on Earth. Recent detections of optical millisecond pulsations from three systems in distinct evolutionary stages have opened an entirely new observational window to investigate particle acceleration, pulsar-disk interplay, and intrabinary wind interactions. These discoveries reveal unexpectedly diverse emission mechanisms across accretion regimes, with optical efficiencies in some systems far exceeding those predicted by rotation-powered models. Despite decades of research, key questions remain unresolved: are optical pulsations a universal property of MSPs? How does the presence of an accretion disk boost the conversion of spin-down power into coherent optical emission? What physical processes drive the observed fast variability, and how do pulsar and companion winds regulate mass transfer and binary evolution? Addressing these fundamental problems requires high-time-resolution optical observations, rapid-response observing capabilities, and time-resolved spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution to map disk and intrabinary-shock variability. Future facilities dedicated to time domain astronomy present a unique opportunity to perform a systematic exploration of optical pulsars across all MSP evolutionary stages for the first time and answer the above-mentioned fundamental questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We describe a pilot study to explore a new generation of fast and low noise CMOS image sensors for time domain astronomy, using two remote telescopes with a baseline of 1800 km. Methods. Direct imaging with novel qCMOS image sensor technology that combines fast readout with low readout noise. Synchronized observations from two remote telescope sites will be used to explore new approaches for measuring solar system bodies, precision stellar photometry, and speckle imaging. Results. A fast-track installation of an ORCA-Quest 2 camera at the Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA) 1.23m telescope has demonstrated the potential of the qCMOS technology for time domain astronomy. Conclusions. qCMOS technology generally outperforms classical CCDs for high-cadence imaging on 1-m telescopes, although EMCCDs remain competitive, and in some cases slightly superior, for very short exposures and faint sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ongoing work on the Central Trigger Processor board (CTPb), a trigger subsystem for the future advanced SiPM-based Large-Sized Telescope (LST) camera of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The camera will implement a fully digital trigger, exploiting the increased resolution to improve discrimination of low-energy $\gamma$-ray events from Night Sky Background noise. This approach aims to enhance telescope sensitivity while satisfying strict timing and data rate constraints. We describe the CTPb conceptual design and report initial results from hardware prototypes under evaluation within this next-generation trigger architecture.</description>

      <title>QUIJOTE-TFGI polarization calibration -- Ground characterization and on-sky validation with Tau A and the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our objective is to characterize the QUIJOTE Thirty and Forty GHz instrument (TFGI), calibrate it with a reference calibration signal on the ground, compare our results with on-sky calibration based on bright sources, and study the stability of the calibration parameters over time. First, from the ground, we fit the data using a reference calibration signal (a diode) introduced to resolve degeneracies among the various instrument angles. Finally, we utilize on-sky observations of Tau A and the Moon to validate the results. By creating calibration datasets obtained with the reference diode, we evaluate the data quality and quantify phase switch errors to account for the fine polarization response. We also utilize Tau A and Moon observations to calibrate the system's response and stability over time. In addition, we calculate the refraction index of the Moon to be $n_{Moon}$ = 1.209 $\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\pm$ 0.005 (sys) at 31 GHz under smooth-surface assumption. The results from fitting the instrument phase-switch error angle align with 0 deg at 2$\sigma$ precision, indicating that no further correction is required within a few percent precision. The calibrations with astrophysical sources (Tau A and the Moon) yield consistent results that constrain the polarization angle and responsivity. The polarization efficiency aligns well with ground measurements and the Tau A characterization, whereas the Moon-based calibration is more affected by systematics. We find hints of responsivity variations over time, although the relative responsivity between channels is found to remain stable. In the future, we conclude that installing a live calibrator will enhance performance by continuously monitoring responsivity and, in turn, improving the mitigation of systematic effects.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Time-domain astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline the science case for a 30-40 m optical/infrared telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, optimised for transformative time-domain astronomy in the 2040s. Upcoming multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities will reveal fast, faint, rapidly evolving Northern transients whose earliest phases carry decisive diagnostics. A Northern ELT with rapid response, broad wavelength coverage, high time resolution, polarimetric capabilities, and diffraction-limited imaging is essential to capture these phases and secure deep spectroscopy and photometry as transients fade. These capabilities will enable recovery of key physical information and detailed characterisation of transient environments, while also enabling unprecedented studies of accretion phenomena at all scales. Among potential sites, La Palma uniquely combines atmospheric stability, complementary longitude to ESO's ELT, protected dark skies, and robust infrastructure to host this facility.</description>

      <title>Interfacing adaptive optics simulations with the optical model: a powerful tool for MORFEO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the MORFEO project, the Multi-Conjugated Adaptive Optics (MCAO) module for the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), we developed an integrated modeling tool to interface the optical model with the adaptive optics simulations, called ASSO (Adaptive opticS Simulation interfaced with Optical model). This tool is our asso nella manica (ace in the hole) to predict the performances of the AO relay, i.e., to estimate the wavefront error within the technical and scientific fields of view after AO correction. The tool is based on the IDL based simulator PyrAmid Simulator Software for Adaptive opTics Arcetri (PASSATA), on Zemax OpticStudio for the optical modelling, and on Matlab as interface software.</description>

Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy will be transformed in the 2040s by an unprecedented volume of detections from next-generation gravitational wave, high-energy, and ultra-high energy neutrino, cosmic ray, and time domain observatories. This white paper, prepared for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Expanding Horizons call, outlines the key science questions enabled by this emerging multi-messenger ecosystem, ranging from nucleosynthesis and dense matter physics to cosmology, fundamental physics, and the growth of black holes across cosmic time. We demonstrate that fully exploiting these discoveries requires a step change in optical to near infrared spectroscopic capability, including low latency response, high throughput, and flexible time domain operations across both hemispheres. We argue that without a dedicated large-aperture time domain facility, the scientific return of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s will be considerably limited.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of the Milky Way: Unveiling the 6D Skeleton of Star Formation in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) is our unique laboratory to test star formation theories at the level of individual stars, serving as the Rosetta Stone to interpret extragalactic observations. The proposed White Paper focuses on the following key questions regarding the structure and evolution of the MW traced by young stellar populations: Q1. How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3. Are the clustered star-forming regions the only environments where stars form, or can stars also form in more diffuse structures such as the stellar strings?</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Preprocessing Framework for Improving Rare Transient Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With large numbers of transients discovered by current and future imaging surveys, machine learning is increasingly applied to light curve and host galaxy properties to select events for follow-up. However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs).</description>

      <title>Spirals and Vertical Motions in the Planet-Forming Disk around HD 100546. A multi-line study of its gas kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HD100546 represents a particularly interesting target to study dynamical planet-disk interactions as various features have been observed in both the dust and gas that provide direct and indirect evidence for ongoing planet formation. In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk.</description>

      <title>Vertically resolved minimal-set k-distribution for thermal infrared absorption in the Venus atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original k-distribution technique is applied to parameterize absorption of thermal radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere of Venus. It is developed for modeling scenarios in which the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates the use of efficient and simplified parameterizations, such as climate modeling. Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo radiative transfer method is embedded into the construction of the k-terms, providing explicit control over accuracy. Using 16 spectral bands spanning 10--6000 cm^{-1}, the method produces 32 k-terms and 16 per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. Vertical resolution of the resulting k-terms is a key advantage, as it avoids the inter-level correlation assumption inherent to the correlated-k method. Height-dependent k(z) functions are supplied on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, enabling direct use in radiative transfer solvers and eliminating the need for vertical interpolation. The implementation yields plausible accuracy below 90 km, with cooling-rate errors of about 1 K day^{-1} and flux errors below 1 percent, while reducing the number of k-terms by a factor of approximately 2.5--3 relative to typical correlated-k approaches. A Fortran driver for generating k(z) functions for arbitrary Venus atmospheric profiles is provided in a public repository.</description>

      <title>The Alignment of High-resolution Solar Prominence Images Observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High spatial resolution observation of solar prominence is an important observation subject of the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). While the current level of observation and image reconstruction technologies for solar prominences are advanced, a significant challenge remains in achieving high-precision alignment among high-resolution prominence images observed at different times and different off-bands. Existing alignment approaches either become ineffective or yield low accuracy, and always require manual intervention during the alignment. These limitations are largely due to the stronger edge gradient and lower structural contrast of the prominence images compared with the solar surface ones. In response to this challenge, our study aims to develop an effective and robust algorithm for high-precision alignment of the prominence images. We thoroughly consider the unique structural characteristics of prominence images and the specific application conditions of various alignment algorithms. Consequently, we propose a comprehensive alignment method that incorporates the optical flow field of the solar surface, the gradient of the solar edge, and the cross-correlation within the solar prominence region. This method is designed to accurately determine the movement displacements among the prominence images. Our results demonstrate that this alignment method excels in both accuracy and robustness, making it well-suited for handling the diverse postures of solar prominence images captured by the NVST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the bilateral collaboration between Bulgarian and Austrian solar and space weather researchers on the topic of chromospheric and coronal activity. This new project will focus, on one hand, on the technical setup and calibration of the new Rozhen chromospheric telescope at the National Astronomical Observatory (NAO) by means of establishing optimal observational programs for different quiet-Sun and activity phenomena, automating the data collection and storage, implementing machine/deep learning models for feature recognition. The second aim is to carry out joint scientific analyses of solar phenomena using observations from ground-based instruments in both countries, and supplementary spacecraft data. The successful implementation of solar monitoring at NAO-Rozhen will facilitate the overall visibility of the Bulgarian instrument and generate interest towards astronomy and solar physics not only for PhD students and young scientists but also for the general public.</description>

      <title>NASA/NOAA MOU Annex Final Report: Evaluating Model Advancements for Predicting CME Arrival Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this project was to assess improvements in CME arrival time forecasts at Earth using the Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) model driven by data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) ground observatories. These outputs are then fed into the coupled Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) - ENLIL model and compared to an operational version of WSA-ENLIL (without ADAPT). SWPC selected a set of 38 historical events over the period of five years from 2012--2014 (33 events) and 2017--2019 (5 events). The overall three-year project consisted of multiple simulation validation studies for the entire event set (1292 simulations): (a) benchmark single map (operational version prior to May 2019) (b) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving WSA-ENLIL with 4 different model settings (c) single test simulation of a time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (d) single GONG map driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (e) time-dependent sequence of GONG maps driving ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL. We report that for all 38 events, within each model version/settings combination, the CME arrival time error decreased by 0.2 to 0.9 hours when using a sequence of time-dependent zero-point corrected magnetograms compared to using single magnetogram input. Overall, for all events, when using the older uncorrected magnetograms, the CME arrival time error increased for all new model versions/settings combination compared to the benchmark. Notably for the 5 events in the period 2017--2019 when more reliable zero-point corrected magnetograms were available, the ADAPT-WSA-ENLIL (median arrival realization) CME arrival time error decreased against all benchmarks. In this report we also discuss replicating the operational model, challenges in detecting CME arrival in simulations, and comparing zero-point corrected and uncorrected magnetogram inputs.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels in the Three-Backlink Experiment for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current planned space-based gravitational-wave detectors require a bidirectional optical connection, referred to as Backlink, between two adjacent optical benches to provide a mutual phase reference for the local interferometric measurements. However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation. We achieve a setup noise floor below $1\text{ pm}\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ across most of the LISA measurement band, and provide an understanding of the current technical limitations. With this low-noise baseline, we measured the performance of the three Backlink implementations under non-rotational conditions. We show that all three Backlinks reach sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels across most of the frequency band, with the remaining part dominated by the mentioned testbed noise. This enabled us to conduct a preliminary study of the Backlink inherent noise, where we emphasized on the backscatter noise intrinsic to a straightforward fiber-based Backlink, as this is the current baseline for LISA.</description>

      <title>Construction techniques and commissioning of the Three-Backlink Experiment for the LISA mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designed to detect gravitational waves in the lower-frequency band, the space mission LISA will open a new window to astronomy after its launch in the 2030s. Each LISA spacecraft houses two optical benches that require the exchange of a phase reference between them via an optical connection, called a Backlink. Here we present the construction and commissioning of an ultra-stable quasi-monolithic optical testbed to investigate different Backlink implementations: a direct fiber, a frequency-separated fiber, and a free-beam link, compared in the Three-Backlink Experiment. Dedicated alignment techniques crucial for the construction of these optical benches are presented together with the development of a high-precision beam alignment and measurement tool - a Calibrated Quadrant Photodiode Singleton. An upper limit for the performance of all three investigated Backlink schemes, as determined by initial experiments, can be set at a $15\text{pm}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$-equivalent level within the LISA band, spanning 0.1mHz to 1Hz. Our measurements were able to verify the successful construction and commissioning of this very complex interferometer as an interferometric laboratory testbed for LISA. We find no limitations due to the construction on the here reported performance levels. Our results can support the construction of high-precision metrology testbeds for space-based laser interferometry for future gravitational wave or geodesy missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a harmonic-space estimator for the cross-correlation between the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the reconstructed galaxy momentum field that offers several practical advantages over the traditional stacking approach. The estimator is easy to deploy using relatively modest computational resources and recovers all information available in the galaxy-kSZ cross-correlation. In particular, by using well-understood power spectrum estimation techniques, its statistical uncertainties, including potential correlated uncertainties with other large-scale structure observables, can be easily and accurately estimated. Moreover, standard kSZ stacking measurements can be reconstructed exactly from the estimator at a lower computational cost, employing harmonic-space, catalog-level techniques to recover all small-scale information.</description>

      <title>NGC 3521 as the Milky Way near twin: spectral energy distribution from UV to radio decameter ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Milky Way analogues (MWAs) are usually selected from structural and kinematic properties, but robust SED-based similarity criteria are limited by heterogeneous photometry and incomplete wavelength coverage. We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}&lt;11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.</description>

      <title>Multiband neural network classification of ZTF light curves as LSST proxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this project we use data obtained by Zwicky Transient Facility to develop and test a neural-network-based, multiband classification algorithm to classify periodic variable stars (i.e. pulsating variable stars and eclipsing binaries). The aim is to utilize the algorithm on LSST data once they become available. Phase-folded light curve images and period information were used from five different variable star types: Classical and Type II Cepheids, {\delta} Scuti stars, eclipsing binaries, and RR Lyrae stars. The data is taken from the 17th data release of ZTF, from which we used two passbands, g and r in this project. The periods were calculated from the raw data and this information was used as an additional numerical input in the neural network. For the training and testing process a supervised machine learning method was created, the neural network contains Convolutional Neural Networks concatenated with Fully Connected Layers.
  During the training-validation process the training accuracy reached 99% and the validation accuracy peaked at 95.6%. At the test classification phase three variable star types out of the 5 classes were classified with around 99% of accuracy, the other two also had very high accuracy, 89.6% and 93.6%.</description>

Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 80,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 51,000 transition wavenumbers, 18,000 line intensities, 33,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3300 assignments. 44,000 new lines were added with 16,000 old lines removed, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote sensing instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, speed-independent pressure broadening parameters of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were gathered and used to fit Pad\'e-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadening parameters were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.</description>
