      <title>Impact of a Blockchain-based Universal Basic Income Pilot: The case of Circles UBI currency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circles UBI is a blockchain-based Community Currency System (CCS) that has been active in Berlin (Germany) since October 2021. The Circles Coop, which launched the project in 2021, was shut down in December 2023. In this paper, we show the results of a survey carried out between October and November 2023. The respondents were twenty-five individuals involved in various ways in the Circles' network. The main emerging narrative points out how their participation was deeply motivated by their identification with the values and ideals of the Circles community. Among them, we selected five profiles that stood for their difference in type and degree of involvement. Finally, we report some stories of economic linkages that suggest a positive externality in adopting a local community currency. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study of a universal basic income designed as a community currency and adopting blockchain technology. This pilot project was a remarkable experiment for its adopted advanced technological and social innovations. In fact, as far as we know, the integration of basic income and local currency features has been experimented with only in two other cases (Maric\'a, Brazil and Barcelona, Spain) and none of them adopted a decentralized ledger system. In this work, we try to outline strengths and weaknesses that emerged after about two years of activity. For this reason, future researchers and activists interested in this field will find valuable information.</description>

      <title>How Election Shocks Move Markets: Evidence from Sectoral Stock Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the effects of U.S. presidential election cycles on sectoral stock markets. Using a high-frequency identification approach, I construct a novel "election shock'' series, which captures exogenous surprises in election probabilities. Aside from election outcomes, the largest shocks are associated with events that are orthogonal to innovations in the macroeconomy, e.g., scandals and debates. These shocks have immediate effects on asset prices in sectors that are differentially impacted by the policy platforms of the two major U.S. political parties. In particular, shocks favoring Republican (Democratic) candidates increase (decrease) the asset prices in the energy and defense sectors, while decreasing (increasing) prices in the clean energy sector. These effects persist overtime.</description>

      <title>Zonal vs. Nodal Pricing: An Analysis of Different Pricing Rules in the German Day-Ahead Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09265v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European electricity market is based on large pricing zones with a uniform day-ahead price. The energy transition leads to changes in supply and demand and increasing redispatch costs. In an attempt to ensure efficient market clearing and congestion management, the EU Commission has mandated the Bidding Zone Review (BZR) to reevaluate the configuration of European bidding zones. Based on a unique data set published in the context of the BZR for the target year 2025, we compare \textcolor{black}{the short-run effects of} various pricing rules for the German power market. We compare market clearing and pricing for different zonal and nodal models, including their generation costs and associated redispatch costs. In numerical experiments with this dataset, the differences in the average prices in different zones are low. Congestion arises as well, but not necessarily on the cross-zonal interconnectors. The total costs across different configurations are similar and the reduction of standard deviations in prices is also small. This might be different with other load and generation scenarios, but the BZR data is important as it was created to make a decision about splits of the existing bidding zones. Nodal pricing rules lead to the lowest total cost. We also evaluate differences of nodal pricing rules with respect to the necessary uplift payments, which is relevant in the context of the current discussion on non-uniform pricing in the EU. While the study focuses on Germany, the analysis is relevant beyond and feeds into the broader discussion about pricing rules in non-convex markets.</description>

      <title>Topological Components in a Community Currency Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transaction data from digital payment systems can be used to study economic processes in such detail that was not possible previously. Here, data from the Sarafu token network, a Community Inclusion Currency in Kenya, is analysed. During the COVID-19 emergency, Sarafu was distributed as part of a humanitarian aid project. In this work, the transactions are analysed using network science. A topological categorisation is defined to identify cyclic and acyclic components. Furthermore, temporal aspects of the circulation that takes place within these components are considered. The significant presence of different types of strongly connected components compared to randomised null models shows the importance of cycles in this economic network. Especially, indicating their key role in currency recirculation. In some acyclic components, the most significant triad suggests the presence of a group of users collecting currency from accounts that are active only once, hinting at a possible misuse of the system. In some other acyclic components, small isolated groups of users were active only once, suggesting the presence of users only interested in trying the system out. The methods used in this paper can answer specific questions related to user activities, currency design, and assessment of monetary interventions. The methodology provides a general quantitative tool to analyse the behaviour of users in a currency network.</description>

      <title>The "Days of Learning" Metric for Education Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third National Charter School Study aimed to test whether charter school were effective and to highlight outcomes on academic progress. The results showed that typical charter school students outperformed similar students in noncharter public schools by 6 days in mathematics and 16 days in reading. The key metric used to claim better performance in charter schools is "days of learning." In this report, the origin of the days-of-learning metric is explored with NAEP data, and the interpretation of days of learning as within-year growth is considered.</description>

      <title>Can AI Solve the Peer Review Crisis? A Large Scale Cross Model Experiment of LLMs' Performance and Biases in Evaluating over 1000 Economics Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the potential of large language models (LLMs) to augment the academic peer review process by reliably evaluating the quality of economics research without introducing systematic bias. We conduct one of the first large-scale experimental assessments of four LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemma 3, and LLaMA 3.3) across two complementary experiments. In the first, we use nonparametric binscatter and linear regression techniques to analyze over 29,000 evaluations of 1,220 anonymized papers drawn from 110 economics journals excluded from the training data of current LLMs, along with a set of AI-generated submissions. The results show that LLMs consistently distinguish between higher- and lower-quality research based solely on textual content, producing quality gradients that closely align with established journal prestige measures. Claude and Gemma perform exceptionally well in capturing these gradients, while GPT excels in detecting AI-generated content. The second experiment comprises 8,910 evaluations designed to assess whether LLMs replicate human like biases in single blind reviews. By systematically varying author gender, institutional affiliation, and academic prominence across 330 papers, we find that GPT, Gemma, and LLaMA assign significantly higher ratings to submissions from top male authors and elite institutions relative to the same papers presented anonymously. These results emphasize the importance of excluding author-identifying information when deploying LLMs in editorial screening. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence and practical guidance for integrating LLMs into peer review to enhance efficiency, improve accuracy, and promote equity in the publication process of economics research.</description>
