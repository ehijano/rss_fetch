      <title>PyMGal: A Python Package for Generating Optical Mock Observations from Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PyMGal, a Python package for generating optical mock observations of galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations. PyMGal reads the properties of stellar particles from these simulations and generates spectral energy distributions (SEDs) based on a variety of stellar population models that can be customised to fit the user's choice of applications. Given these SEDs, the program can calculate the brightness of particles in different output units for hundreds of unique filters. These quantities can then be projected to a 2D plane mimicking a telescope observation. The software is compatible with different snapshot formats and allows a flexible selection of models, filters, output units, axes of projection, angular resolutions, fields of view, and more. It also supports additional features including dust attenuation, particle smoothing, and the option to output spectral data cubes and maps of mass, age, and metallicity. These synthetic observations can be used to directly compare the simulated objects to reality in order to model galaxy evolution, study different theoretical models, and investigate different observational effects. This package allows the user to perform fast and consistent comparisons between simulation and observation, leading to a better and more precise understanding of what we see in our Universe.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery of Latent Variables in Galactic Archaeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic archaeology--the study of stellar migration histories--provides insights into galaxy formation and evolution. However, establishing causal relationships between observable stellar properties and their birth conditions remains challenging, as key properties like birth radius are not directly observable. We employ Rank-based Latent Causal Discovery (RLCD) to uncover the causal structure governing the chemodynamics of a simulated Milky Way galaxy. Using only five observable properties (metallicity, age, and orbital parameters), we recover in a purely data-driven manner a causal graph containing two latent nodes that correspond to real physical properties: the birth radius and guiding radius of stars. Our study demonstrates the potential of causal discovery models in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Eppur Si Muove}$: Self-Sustained Streaming Motions in Multi-Phase MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative cooling can drive dynamics in multi-phase gas. A dramatic example is hydrodynamic `shattering', the violent, pressure-driven fragmentation of a cooling cloud which falls drastically out of pressure balance with its surroundings. We run MHD simulations to understand how shattering is influenced by magnetic fields. In MHD, clouds do not `shatter' chaotically. Instead, after initial fragmentation, both hot and cold phases coherently `stream' in long-lived, field-aligned, self-sustaining gas flows, at high speed ($\sim 100 \, {\rm km \, s^{-1}}$). MHD thermal instability also produces such flows. They are due to the anisotropic nature of MHD pressure support, which only operates perpendicular to B-fields. Thus, even when $P_{\rm B} + P_{\rm gas} \approx$const, pressure balance only holds perpendicular to B-fields. Field-aligned gas pressure variations are unopposed, and results in gas velocities $v \sim (2 \Delta P/\rho)^{1/2}$ from Bernoulli's principle. Strikingly, gas in adjacent flux tubes $\textit{counter-stream}$ in opposite directions. We show this arises from a cooling-induced, MHD version of the thin shell instability. Magnetic tension is important both in enabling corrugational instability and modifying its non-linear evolution. Even in high $\beta$ hot gas, streaming can arise, since magnetic pressure support grows as gas cools and compresses. Thermal conduction increases the sizes and velocities of streaming cloudlets, but does not qualitatively modify dynamics. These results are relevant to the counter-streaming gas flows observed in solar coronal rain, as well as multi-phase gas cooling and condensation in the ISM, CGM and ICM.</description>

      <title>The formation and evolution of Supermassive disks in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive disks are outstanding galaxies whose formation and evolution are still poorly understood. They comprise a large variety of objects, ranging from large, low-surface-brightness galaxies, such as Malin 1, to the most spectacular superluminous spirals. However, we still do not know the physical mechanisms behind its formation, and whether they will be long-lived objects or whether their mass could destroy them in time. We aim to investigate the formation and evolution of these galaxies using the magnetohydrodynamical state-of-the-art simulation IllustrisTNG-100. We defined supermassive disks as galaxies with $\lambda / \sqrt{\varepsilon} \geq 0.31$ or 0.71, and with stellar mass log$_{10}M_\star/M_\odot &gt; 10^{11}$. We studied the color, merging history, AGN history, and environment in which these galaxies reside. Supermassive disk galaxies typically experience a quiescent merging history, with $48\%$ experiencing no significant mergers at $z \leq 1$. Their stellar mass growth is driven mainly by star formation, unlike spheroidal galaxies, which require a significant number of mergers to form. Moreover, the mergers experienced by disk galaxies are generally rich in gas content, irrespective of whether they are minor or major events. Supermassive disks exist across various environments, from isolation to clusters, with $\sim 60\%$ inhabiting in isolation or low-mass groups, $\sim 25\%$ residing in massive groups, and $\sim15\%$ residing within galaxy clusters. When studying the evolution of supermassive disks selected at $z=0.5$, we show that when they gain sufficient mass, the probability of them maintaining their disk-like structure up to $z=0$ is relatively high ($\sim 60\%$). Lastly, while AGN significantly influences the regulation of star formation in galaxies, it does not directly alter their morphological structure.</description>

      <title>Searching for new Hypervelocity Stars with Gaia DR3 and VLT/FORS2 Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypervelocity stars are unique objects moving through the Milky Way at speeds exceeding the local escape velocity, providing valuable insights into the Galactic gravitational potential and the properties of its central supermassive black hole. The advent of Gaia DR3 offers an unprecedented astrometric precision, enabling the discovery of new hypervelocity stars and facilitating their characterization. This study seeks to identify and characterize hypervelocity star candidates using Gaia DR3 data, focusing on stars lacking radial velocity measurements. Our goal was to estimate the total velocities of these stars and establish their origin within the Galactic framework, if possible. We applied strict selection criteria to Gaia DR3 data, focusing on sources with low parallax uncertainties and high astrometric fidelity. The distributions of the total velocities in the Galactic rest frame were derived and used to identify candidates. Spectroscopic follow-up with VLT/FORS2 provided radial velocity measurements for a subset of these candidates. We evaluated the probabilities of stars exceeding local escape velocities under different Galactic potential models and traced their past orbits to identify possible origins. From Gaia DR3, we identified 149 hypervelocity star candidates with Pesc &gt; 50% of exceeding local escape velocities. Our follow-up spectroscopy for 23 of those sources confirms that the selected targets are traveling at high velocities, with many appearing to escape the Galaxy, depending on the Galactic potential adopted. Our analysis suggests that nearly one-third of the stars may have an extra-Galactic origin. These findings highlight the need for more precise astrometric and spectroscopic data to conclusively determine the origins of hypervelocity stars and improve models of the Galactic potential.</description>

      <title>An outer-disk SX Phe variable star in Rubin Data Preview 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an SX Phoenicis-type pulsating variable star via 217 epochs of time-series photometry from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1. The star, designated LSST-DP1-O- 614435753623041404 (or LSST-C25_var1 for short), has mean magnitudes of $(\langle g\rangle, \langle r\rangle) = (18.65, 18.63)$, with pulsation amplitudes of (0.60, 0.38)~mag in these bands. Its period is 0.0767 days (1.841 hours), typical of SX Phe pulsators. We derive a distance to the star of 16.6 kpc based on an SX Phe period-luminosity relation. Its position $\sim5$ kpc from the Galactic plane, in the outer Milky Way disk at a Galactocentric distance of $\sim22$ kpc, and its proper motion suggest that LSST-C25_var1 is part of the Monoceros Ring structure. This star is presented as a small taste of the many thousands of variable stars expected in Rubin/LSST data.</description>

      <title>Probing the variations of interstellar dust abundance and properties within and between galaxies with HWO UV spectroscopy in the Local Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cycle of metals between the gas and the dust phases in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) is an integral part of the baryon cycle in galaxies. The resulting variations in the abundance and properties of interstellar dust have important implications for how accurately we can trace the chemical enrichment of the universe over cosmic time. Multi-object UV spectroscopy with HWO can provide the large samples of abundance and dust depletion measurements needed to understand how the abundance and properties of interstellar dust vary within and between galaxies, thereby observationally addressing important questions about chemical enrichment and galaxy evolution. Medium-resolution (R~50,000) spectroscopy in the full UV range (950-3150 A) toward massive stars in Local Volume galaxies (D &lt; 10 Mpc) will enable gas- and dust-phase abundance measurements of key elements, such as Fe, Si, Mg, S, Zn. These measurements will provide an estimate of how the dust abundance varies with environment, in particular metallicity and gas density. However, measuring the carbon and oxygen contents of dust requires very high resolution (R &gt; 100,000) and high signal-to-noise (S/N &gt; 100) owing to the non-saturated UV transitions for those elements being extremely weak. Since carbon and oxygen in the neutral ISM contribute the largest metal mass reservoir for dust, it is critical that the HWO design include a grating similar to the HST STIS H gratings providing very high resolution, as well as FUV and NUV detectors capable of reaching very high S/N.</description>

      <title>Formation of Complex Organic Molecules in Prestellar Cores: The Role of Non-Diffusive Grain Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of astrochemical modeling of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ice and gas of the prestellar core L1544 with the recently updated MONACO rate equations-based model. The model includes, in particular, non-diffusive processes, new laboratory verified chemical routes for acetaldehyde and methane ice formation and variation of H and $\rm H_2$ desorption energies depending on the surface coverage by $\rm H_2$ molecules. For the first time, we simultaneously reproduce the abundances of several oxygen-bearing COMs in the gas phase, the approximate location of the peak of methanol emission, as well as the abundance of methanol in the icy mantles of L1544. Radical-radical reactions on grains surface between species such as $\rm CH_3$, $\rm CH_3O$ and $\rm HCO$ efficiently proceed non-diffusively. COMs are delivered to the gas phase via chemical desorption amplified by the loops of H-addition/abstraction surface reactions. However, gas-phase chemical reactions as well provide a noticeable input to the formation of COMs in the gas, but not to the COMs solid-state abundances. This particularly applies for CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3$OCH$_3$. The simulated abundances of COMs in the ice are in the range 1\%--2\% (for methyl formate ice) or $\sim$~0.1\% (for CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) with respect to the abundance of H$_2$O ice. We stress a similarity between the simulated abundances of icy COMs in L1544 and the abundances of COMs in the gas phase of hot cores/corinos. We compare our non-diffusive model with the diffusive model and provide constraints for the species' diffusion-to-desorption energy ratios.</description>

      <title>FAST search for circumstellar atomic hydrogen. III. Planetary nebulae at Galactic latitudes |b|&gt;10degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of circumstellar atomic hydrogen (\ion{H}{1}) via the 21\,cm line remains a persistent challenge in planetary nebula (PN) studies, primarily due to contamination from ubiquitous interstellar \ion{H}{1} 21\,cm emission. In this paper, we report the results of a \ion{H}{1} survey of 12 high surface brightness PNe located at Galactic latitudes $|b|\geq10\arcdeg$, performed with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), which is currently the most sensitive telescope in the $L$ band. Although the contamination from interstellar emission is still severe, we detect or tentatively detect circumstellar \ion{H}{1} 21\,cm absorption associated with two PNe: NGC\,6905 and NGC\,7662. \ion{H}{1} exhibits a comparatively high detection frequency in bipolar PNe. We estimate the \ion{H}{1} masses of the two PNe to range from 0.01 to 0.14 $M_{\sun}$, resulting in atomic-to-ionized hydrogen ratios of 0.02--0.3. The \ion{H}{1} shells have dynamical ages of 2100--2400 years. Our measurements confirm previous findings that the optical depth of \ion{H}{1} decreases with increasing linear radius of the nebula. The mass loss rates traced by the \ion{H}{1} absorption are larger than 10$^{-5}$\,M$_\sun$ yr$^{-1}$, indicating that they originate from the superwind phase at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch.</description>

      <title>A 3mm molecular line survey toward IRC+10216</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IRC+10216 is the brightest infrared source in the northern sky, known for its rich chemical composition. It is often used as a standard reference for studying the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of carbon-rich stars. While pioneering 3\,mm spectral surveys have laid foundational datasets, their system temperature limitations rendered spectral line detection thresholds inadequate for probing the source's complex organic molecule inventory at this band, which made superseding observations necessary. We aim to gain an unbiased view regarding circumstellar chemistry and investigate whether IRC+10216 is typical or anomalous in terms of its chemical composition. We carried out an in-depth spectral line survey of the circumstellar envelope of IRC+10216 utilizing the Arizona Radio Observatory 12\,m telescope. We achieved complete spectral sampling across the 90--116 GHz atmospheric window ($\lambda=2.6$--3.3\,mm). A total of 214 emission lines belonging to 43 molecular species are identified in the CSE of IRC+10216, among which 28 lines are newly detected in this object and four emission lines remain unidentified. The excitation temperatures and column densities of 16 molecules are determined through rotation diagrams. We estimate the isotopic ratios of carbon, oxygen, and silicon elements. For the majority of the molecular species, the line intensity ratios between IRC+10216 and CIT\,6 are inversely proportional to the square of their distance, which suggests that the chemical processes occurring within them are similar. Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting that the emission of C$_{4}$H and C$_{3}$N in IRC+10216 is unusually strong. These observations stand as the most sensitive and unbiased line survey of IRC+10216 within the $\lambda=3$ window carried out by a single-dish telescope. They offer a valuable reference for the astronomical community. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Head-on collisions of fuzzy/cold dark matter subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform head-on collision simulations of compact dark matter subhalos using distinct numerical methods for fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) models. For FDM, we solve the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations with a pseudospectral solver, while for CDM, we utilize a smoothed particle hydrodynamics N-body code. Our results show that velocity decrease of subhalos is significantly greater in FDM model than in CDM, particularly at lower initial velocities, attributed to gravitational cooling-a unique mechanism of stabilizing in FDM with dissipating kinetic energy. This stark contrast in energy dissipation between two DM models suggests that FDM may offer valuable insights into understanding the dynamic behaviors of DM during galaxy cluster collisions, such as those observed in the Bullet cluster and Abell 520. These findings strongly suggest that FDM is not only capable of explaining these complex astrophysical phenomena but also serves as a compelling alternative to the traditional CDM model, offering resolutions to longstanding discrepancies in DM behavior.</description>

      <title>Misaligned external gas acquisition boosts central black hole activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One important question in active galactic nucleus (AGN) is how gas is brought down to the galaxy center. Both internal secular evolution (torque induced by non-axisymmetric galactic structures such as bars) and external processes (e.g. mergers or interactions) are expected to redistribute the angular momentum (AM) and transport gas inward. However, it is still under debate whether these processes can significantly affect AGN activities. Here we for the first time report that AGN fraction increases with the difference of kinematic position angles ($\Delta PA\equiv|PA_{\mathrm{gas}}-PA_{\mathrm{star}}|$) between ionized gas ($PA_{\mathrm{gas}}$) and stellar disks ($PA_{\mathrm{star}}$) in blue and green galaxies, meanwhile this fraction remains roughly constant for red galaxies. Also the high luminosity AGN fraction increases with $\Delta PA$ while the low luminosity AGN fraction is independent with $\Delta PA$. These observational results support a scenario in which the interaction between accreted and pre-existing gas provides the AM loss mechanism, thereby the gas inflow fuels the central BH activities, and the AM loss efficiency is positively correlated with the $\Delta PA$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Substructure during Star Cluster Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star cluster formation and assembly occurs inside filamentary and turbulent molecular clouds, which imprints both spatial and kinematic substructure on the young cluster. In this paper, we quantify the amount and evolution of this substructure in simulations of star cluster formation that include radiation magnetohydrodynamical evolution of the gas, coupled with detailed stellar dynamics, binary formation and evolution, and stellar feedback. We find that both spatial and kinematic substructure are present at early times. Both are erased as the cluster assembles through the formation of new stars as well as the merger of sub-clusters. Spatial substructure is erased over a timescale of approximately 2.5 times the initial free-fall time of the cloud. Kinematic substructure persists for longer, and is still present to the end of our simulations. We also explored our simulations for evidence of early dynamical mass segregation, and conclude that the presence of a population of binary stars can accelerate and enhance the mass segregation process.</description>

      <title>CO2 infrared spectra on silicate dust grain analogs: Implications for JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide is one of the three most abundant species within the ice mantles around dust grains inside molecular clouds. Since a substantial amount of interstellar grains is made of siliceous materials, we have studied the infrared profile of CO2 deposited on top of a bare and ice-coated amorphous silicate (MgFeSiO4) film using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). In contrast to a metal surface, the CO2 IR profile shows a relaxation of the metal surface selection rule in the presence of the bare MgFeSiO4 dust grain analog, which brings the IR profile closer to the observational spectra while maintaining the sensitivity of RAIRS. Experiments with the underlying CO and CH4 ices show that their presence facilitates structural changes toward crystalline ice for the deposited CO2 at much lower temperatures than on the polar ice layers. Warming-up experiments of CO2 showed that it tends to stay on the silicate surface for much longer than on the gold surface without the silicate layer. We noticed for the first time a split in the 13CO2 IR feature on the pure or ice-covered silicate grain as a marker for the onset of diffusion. The laboratory 13CO2 profile then closely resembles recent JWST observations of this feature around young and embedded protostars, suggesting that it can be linked to the observed feature.</description>

      <title>Chemical constraints on the dynamical evolution of the cold core L694</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In star-forming regions, molecular cloud history and dynamics set the trend in the chemical composition. Ice formation, in particular, is affected by the evolution of physical conditions, which can lead to different ice compositions within the same cloud. In cold cores with medium densities &gt;1e4 cm-3, low temperatures &lt;15 K, and low UV radiation &lt;G0, most COMs are formed on dust grain surfaces and are released back into the gas phase through non-thermal mechanisms. Studying both gas- and solid-phases can help observers to add constraints on the chemical and dynamical evolution of cold cores. We present a study of the cold core L694, observed with the IRAM 30m telescope. Observed species include CO (and its isotopologues) and CH3OH. We applied an inverted non-LTE radiative transfer code in order to obtain gas-phase abundances by deriving the column densities of the detected species from the spectroscopic parameters of the targeted molecular transitions, and from physical parameters derived from archival observations. This allowed us to probe the molecular abundances as a function of density and visual extinction. In parallel, we ran chemical models (both static and dynamic) to constrain the evolution time of the core by directly comparing the observations with the model outputs. We then compared the compositions of the cold cores L429-C and L694. The gas-phase abundances in L694 all exhibit a common depletion profile (with high variability in the depletion factor), as the core is identified to be in a more advanced (infalling) state compared to L429-C. The physical parameters of the two cores are, however, very similar, leading to close evolutionary timescales in our static models. The dynamical model fails to reproduce the CO gas-phase abundances at high density, predicting an evolutionary timescale that is too short compared to static models.</description>

      <title>The BoRG-$JWST$ Survey: Analogs at $z\sim8$ to the UV-luminous Galaxy Population at $z\gtrsim10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ discovered by JWST, including the so-called "blue monsters", has been difficult to reconcile with standard galaxy evolution models. To shed light on this extraordinary population, we study the $z\sim8$ galaxies discovered by the BoRG-$JWST$ survey. These slightly-lower redshift analogs are comparable in UV luminosity to the blue monsters, and their lower redshift makes it much easier to access key rest frame optical diagnostics with NIRspec. We find that BoRG-$JWST$ galaxies are consistent with being dust-poor based on their blue UV slopes and Balmer decrement ratios. We find no strong evidence for dominant active galactic nuclei contribution to the UV brightness, based on line-ratio diagnostics, though some contribution cannot be excluded. We further infer the stellar mass, star formation and UV-brightness history of the BoRG-$JWST$ galaxies by fitting their rest-frame UV-optical spectra. We see evidence for stochastic episodes of star formation for all the BoRG-$JWST$ galaxies, providing a temporal boosting of UV luminosity in short timescales. The UV-bright blue monsters at $z\gtrsim10$ can be explained by the presence of stars with ages below 100 Myr.</description>

      <title>Constraining the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster Abell 2142 using MeerKAT L-band polarisation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields permeate the Universe, including galaxy clusters, and affect the thermodynamical properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the $\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have been studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that shows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to constrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum within its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal component in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in the L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this purpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised emission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and fractional polarisation ($\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field distribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated from 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion, $\sigma_{\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the $\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity decreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with studies on other clusters. Assuming that the magnetic field energy density scales with the gas thermal energy ($B \propto n_e^{0.5}$), a magnetic field with a power spectrum ranging from scales between 7 and 470 kpc, with peak at $\sim 140$ kpc and mean central strength of $9.5 \pm 1.0 \ \mu$G, provides the best fit to our data. The high central magnetic field lies at the upper end of the range observed in other systems and supports the possibility of an hadronic contribution to the diffuse radio emission previously detected at the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Energy-Dependent Transport of Cosmic Rays in the Multiphase, Dynamic Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of spectrally resolved cosmic ray (CR) protons with kinetic energies between $1-100$ GeV within the dynamic, multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), using a two-moment CR fluid solver applied to a TIGRESS MHD simulation with conditions similar to the solar neighborhood. Our CR transport prescription incorporates space- and momentum-dependent CR scattering coefficients $\sigma=\kappa^{-1}$, computed from the local balance between streaming-driven Alfv\`{e}n wave growth and damping processes. We find that advection combines with momentum-dependent diffusion to produce a CR distribution function $f(p)\propto~p^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma\approx4.6$ that agrees with observations, steepened from an injected power law slope $\gamma_\mathrm{inj}=4.3$. The CR pressure is uniform in the highly diffusive, mostly neutral midplane region, but decreases exponentially in the ionized extraplanar region where scattering is efficient. To interpret these numerical results, we develop a two-zone analytic model that captures and links the two (physically and spatially) distinct regimes of CR transport in the multiphase, dynamic ISM. At low momenta, CR transport is dominated by gas advection, while at high momenta, both advection and diffusion contribute. At high momentum, the analytic prediction for the spectral slope approaches $\gamma=(4/3)\gamma_\mathrm{inj}-1$, and the predicted scaling of grammage with momentum is $X\propto p^{1-\gamma_\mathrm{inj}/3}$, consistent with the simulations. These results support a physical picture in which CRs are confined within the neutral midplane by the surrounding ionized gas, with their escape regulated by both the CR scattering rate in the ionized extraplanar gas and the velocity and Alfv\'{e}n speed of that gas, at effective speed $v_\mathrm{c,eff}\approx(1/2)[\kappa_\parallel~d(v+v_\mathrm{A,i})/dz]^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>XRISM Observation of the Ophiuchus Galaxy Cluster: Quiescent Velocity Structure in the Dynamically Disturbed Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster core using the XRISM satellite. Despite previous observations revealing multiple cold fronts and dynamical disturbances in the cluster core, our XRISM observations show low gas velocity dispersions of \sigma_v = 115 +/- 7 km s^{-1} in the inner region (~&lt; 25 kpc) and \sigma_v = 186 +/- 9 km s^{-1} in the outer region (~ 25-50 kpc). The gas temperatures are kT = 5.5 +/- 0.2 keV and 8.4 +/- 0.2 keV for the inner and outer regions, respectively, with metal abundances of Z = 0.75 +/- 0.03 Z_sun (inner) and 0.44 +/- 0.02 Z_sun (outer). The measured velocity dispersions correspond to nonthermal pressure fractions of only 1.4 +/- 0.2% (inner) and 2.5 +/- 0.2% (outer), indicating highly subsonic turbulence. Our analysis of the bulk gas motion indicates that the gas in the inner region is nearly at rest relative to the central galaxy (|v_bulk|=8 +/- 7 km s^{-1}), while the outer region exhibits a moderate motion of |v_bulk|=104 +/- 7 km s^{-1}. Assuming the velocity dispersion arises from turbulent motions, the turbulent heating rate is only ~ 40% of the radiative cooling rate, although there is some uncertainty. This suggests that the heating and cooling of the gas are not balanced. The activity of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has apparently weakened. The sloshing motion that created the cold fronts may now be approaching a turning point at which the velocity is minimum.</description>

      <title>Fewer Companions in the Crowd: The Low Close Binary Fraction in Globular Clusters from Gaia RVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dense environments like globular clusters (GCs), dynamical interactions can disrupt or harden close binaries, nonetheless, detailed comparisons with field binary fractions remain limited. Here, we present an analysis of the close binary fraction in a carefully selected sample of field stars and 10 GCs using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) data, which is among the largest samples of GCs analysed using multi-epoch spectroscopy to date. By assessing the peak-to-peak variations of the sources' radial velocity (RV), we estimate the close binary fractions through a method that fits the distribution as the product of two Gaussian distributions. By applying the same RV-variability method to both cluster members and field stars, we ensure a homogeneous and inclusive comparison between the two environments. Despite matching stellar parameters between the field and GC samples, our findings confirm that GCs possess a significantly lower close binary fraction than field stars. Interestingly, we do not detect any clear trend of binary fraction with cluster metallicity; metal-rich and metal-poor GCs are uniformly binary-poor (within uncertainties). We discuss possible interpretations, including dynamical hardening in dense environments and the effects of common envelope evolution, which may lead to companion accretion or merger events.</description>

      <title>DeepCHART: Mapping the 3D dark matter density field from Ly$\alpha$ forest surveys using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DeepCHART (Deep learning for Cosmological Heterogeneity and Astrophysical Reconstruction via Tomography), a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density field at redshift $z=2.5$ from Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra. Leveraging a 3D variational autoencoder with a U-Net architecture, DeepCHART performs fast, likelihood-free inference, accurately capturing the non-linear gravitational dynamics and baryonic processes embedded in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. When applied to joint datasets combining Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption and coeval galaxy positions, the reconstruction quality improves further. For current surveys, such as Subaru/PFS, CLAMATO, and LATIS, with an average transverse sightline spacing of $d_\perp=2.4h^{-1}$cMpc, DeepCHART achieves high-fidelity reconstructions over the density range $0.4&lt;\Delta_{\rm DM}&lt;15$, with a voxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficient of $\rho\simeq 0.77$. These reconstructions are obtained using Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra with signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2 and instrumental resolution $R=2500$, matching Subaru/PFS specifications. For future high-density surveys enabled by instruments such as ELT/MOSAIC and WST/IFS with $d_\perp\simeq 1h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$, the correlation improves to $\rho\simeq 0.90$ across a wider dynamic range ($0.25&lt;\Delta_{\rm DM}&lt;40$). The framework reliably recovers the dark matter density PDF as well as the power spectrum, with only mild suppression at intermediate scales. In terms of cosmic web classification, DeepCHART successfully identifies 81% of voids, 75% of sheets, 63% of filaments, and 43% of nodes. We propose DeepCHART as a powerful and scalable framework for field-level cosmological inference, readily generalisable to other observables, and offering a robust, efficient means of maximising the scientific return of upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmic Ray Electron Spectra and Synchrotron Emission in the Multiphase ISM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the transport and spectral evolution of 1-100 GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons (CREs) in TIGRESS MHD simulations of the magnetized, multiphase interstellar medium. We post-process a kpc-sized galactic disk patch representative of the solar neighborhood using a two-moment method for CR transport that includes advection, streaming, and diffusion. The diffusion coefficient is set by balancing wave growth via the CR streaming instability against wave damping (nonlinear Landau and ion-neutral collisions), depending on local gas and CR properties. Implemented energy loss mechanisms include synchrotron, inverse Compton, ionization, and bremsstrahlung. We evaluate CRE losses by different mechanisms as a function of energy and distance from the midplane, and compare loss timescales to transport and diffusion timescales. This comparison shows that CRE spectral steepening above p = 1 GeV/c is due to a combination of energy-dependent transport and losses. Our evolved CRE spectra are consistent with direct observations in the solar neighborhood, with a spectral index that steepens from an injected value of -2.3 to an energy dependent value between -2.7 and -3.3. We also show that the steepening is independent of the injection spectrum. Finally, we present potential applications of our models, including to the production of synthetic synchrotron emission. Our simulations demonstrate that the CRE spectral slope can be accurately recovered from pairs of radio observations in the range 1.5-45 GHz.</description>

      <title>Dark from light (DfL): Inferring halo properties from luminous tracers with machine learning trained on cosmological simulations. I. Method, proof of concept &amp; preliminary testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Dark from Light (DfL) - a novel method to infer the dark sector in wide-field galaxy surveys, leveraging a machine learning approach trained on contemporary cosmological simulations. The aim of this algorithm is to provide a fast, straightforward, and accurate route to estimating dark matter halo masses and group membership in wide-field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. This approach requires a highly limited number of input parameters and yields full probability distribution functions for the output halo masses. To achieve this, we train a series of Random Forest (RF) regression models on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations at z=0-3, which provide model-dependent mappings from luminous tracers to dark matter halo properties. We incorporate the individual regression models into a virial group-finding algorithm (DfL), which outputs halo properties for observational-like input data. We test the method at z=0-2 for both the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG models, as well as in a cross-validation mode. We demonstrate that known halo masses can be recovered with a mean systematic bias of $\langle b \rangle = \pm 0.10\,$dex (resulting from simulation choice), a mean statistical uncertainty of $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.12 \,$dex across epochs, and a central - (core) satellite classification accuracy of 96%. We establish that this approach yields superior halo mass recovery to standard abundance matching applied to groups identified through a friends-of-friends algorithm. Additionally, we compare the outputs of DfL to observational constraints on the $M_* - M_{\rm Halo}$ relation from strong gravitational lensing at $z \sim 0$, demonstrating the promise of this novel approach. Finally, we systematically quantify how DfL performs on observational-like input data with varying stellar mass uncertainty and spectroscopic incompleteness, enabling robust error calibration.</description>

      <title>Ultralight fuzzy dark matter review</title>

Abstract: Ultralight dark matter refers to the lightest potential dark matter candidates. We will focus on the mass range that has been studied using astrophysical and cosmological observations, corresponding to a mass $10^{-24} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{eV}$. We will discuss the motivations for this mass range. The most studied model in this range corresponds to a minimally coupled, single, classical, spin-0 field comprising all dark matter. However, the work exploring extensions of this model (for example, higher spin, self-coupled, multiple field, and mixed models) will be one of the focuses of this review. The phenomenology associated with ultralight dark matter is rich and includes linear effects on the primordial power spectrum, core structures forming at the center of halos, nonlinear effects resulting in heating of stellar distributions, and non-relativistic effects relating to pulsar signals and black hole superradiance, to name a few. This set of effects has been studied using an equally extensive set of numerical tools. We will summarize the most common ones and discuss their applications and limitations. Ultralight dark matter also has a wide variety of observational constraints, including halo mass functions, the Lyman-alpha forest, halo density profiles, stellar dynamics, and black hole spins. We will review them focusing on the observations made, the method of study, and the major systematics. We will end with a discussion of the current status of the field and future work needed.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey: Projected Rotational Velocities of B stars in the Carina Nebula</title>

Abstract: The Carina Nebula is an active star-forming region with several open clusters rich in massive OB stars, thus making it an optimal target for studying stellar properties such as rotation for large samples of these early-type stars. We studied a sample of early-type stars probable members of the 8 open clusters in the Carina Complex. The observational data consist of high-resolution spectra from the Gaia-ESO public Spectroscopic Survey. Astrometric and photometric data from Gaia EDR3 and radial velocities measured from the observed spectra are used to confirm the cluster members. The projected rotational velocities of 330 early-type stars of Carina are derived from the widths of \ion{He}{i} lines at 4388 and 4471 \AA. The reported \Vsini\ values are the first estimates for 222 early-type stars. The \Vsini\ distribution for the Carina clusters peaks at $\sim$100-150 \kms, consistent with the distributions for B stars in Galactic clusters. \Vsini\ estimates for stars members of the clusters Trumpler 15, Collinder 228, Collinder 232, and Bochum 11 are presented for the first time in the literature. For a subsample of stars with earlier spectral types from B0 to B3, we find a bimodal distribution, with a third, small peak towards the upper values of \Vsini. When the full sample is split according to the parent cluster, we find that the oldest cluster in our sample, NGC 3293, presents a higher concentration of rapidly rotating stars. In contrast, Collinder 228 presents a larger number of stars with lower \Vsini.</description>

      <title>Photospheric Helium Abundance in Cool Giants -- A Comprehensive Study</title>

Abstract: High-resolution optical spectra of sixteen red giants, two early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and two supergiants, having no/minimal to super lithium (Li)-rich abundances, are analyzed to investigate the helium (He)-enhancement. The spectra of eight giants were obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and for the rest of the program stars the spectral data were collected from various public archives. Our detailed abundance analyses of the program stars involve the determination of stellar parameters and abundances for about 20 elements among the key abundances of He, Li, C, N, O and the 12C/13C ratios. The difference in the Mg-abundance derived from Mg I lines and the MgH band, and the difference in carbon abundance from C I and the CH-band, are used as a clue to the mild hydrogen-deficiency/helium-enhancement. From this analysis, four red giants, an early-AGB star and a supergiant star were found to be enhanced in helium. All these He-enhanced stars are also found to be super Li-rich except for the supergiant. Since the He-rich red giants are Li-rich as well, this implies, that He-enrichment is accompanied by Li-enrichment but not vice-versa. This is the first spectroscopic measurement of photospheric He-abundance in normal and Li-rich field giants. The Li-enrichment is observed across the giant branch from RGB-bump (KIC 9821622) to AGB phase, unlike that expected from the RGB-tip to RC-phase. A plausible scenario for the enrichment of He and as well as Li in giants is the fresh synthesis of Li in the interiors of giants and dredging up along with He to the surface, from deeper layers. However, there could be multiple scenarios operating in tandem. This analysis of He- and Li-enrichment along with other key elements provides more insights to decipher the mystery of Li-enrichment in giants.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pop III.1 Protostars Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation. I. Fiducial model and first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of billion-solar-mass quasars at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$ poses a formidable challenge to theories of black hole formation, requiring pathways for the rapid growth of massive seeds. Population III.1 stars, forming in pristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This study presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1 protostars, calculated with the \textsc{GENEC} code. We systematically explore a wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of $\rho_\chi \sim 10^{12}\mbox{-}10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and gas accretion rates of $10^{-3}\mbox{-}10^{-1}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, to quantify the effects of DM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to supermassive scales ($\gtrsim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$), the ambient DM density in the immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of $\rho_{\chi} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{GeV cm}^{-3}$. The energy injected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface temperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt accretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating also governs the star's final fate: in dense halos ($\rho_\chi \gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), stars remain stable against general relativistic instability beyond $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, whereas at lower densities ($\rho_\chi \lesssim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), they collapse at masses of $\sim 5 \times 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core burning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can reach very high levels $\sim 10^{53} s^{-1}$. These distinct evolutionary phases offer clear observational signatures for the JWST, providing a robust, physically-grounded pathway for forming heavy black hole seeds in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Probing Chemical Enrichment in Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical composition of galaxies offers vital insights into their formation and evolution. In particular, the relationship between helium abundance (He/H) and metallicity serves as a key diagnostic for estimating the primordial helium yield from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We investigate the chemical enrichment history of low-metallicity galaxies, focusing especially on extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs), using one-zone chemical evolution models. Adopting elemental yields from Limongi and Chieffi (2018), our models reach He/H ~ 0.089 at (O/H) $\times 10^5&lt;20$, yet they fall short of reproducing the elevated He/H values observed in low redshift dwarf galaxies. In contrast, the observed Fe/O ratios in EMPGs are successfully reproduced using both the Nomoto et al. (2013) and Limongi and Chieffi (2018) yield sets. To address the helium discrepancy, we incorporate supermassive stars (SMSs) as Pop III stars in our models. We find that SMSs can significantly enhance He/H, depending on the mass-loss prescription. When only 10 percent of the SMS mass is ejected, the model yields the steepest slope in the (O/H) $\times 10^5$ - He/H relation. Alternatively, if the entire outer envelope up to the CO core is expelled, the model can reproduce the high He/H ratios observed in high-redshift galaxies (He/H &gt; 0.1). Additionally, these SMS-enriched models also predict elevated N/O ratios, in agreement with recent JWST observations of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Where is the Super-Virial Gas? The Supply from hot inflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an effort to understand the presence of super-virial gas detected in the Milky Way, we present our findings from isolated galaxy simulations of Milky Way-like systems using GIZMO with the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model. It unveils the presence of a significant super-virial temperature ( $T&gt;6\times10^6$K) gas component within 20 kpc from the galactic center. This super-virial gas has a mass of $1-2\times10^7$ ${\rm M_\odot}$ and is found close to the disk, where typical gas densities are $0.004-0.01 \, \rm cm^{-3}$. We find that some of the virial gas ($T\sim10^6$K) forms a rotating hot inflow, where gravitational energy is converted to heat mainly via compressive heating. This process causes gas infalling close to the rotation axis to reach super-virial temperatures just before cooling and joining the disk. Stellar feedback heating accounts for less than 1% of the super-virial gas, indicating its minimal influence despite expectations. Even in scenarios with no stellar feedback effects considered, abundant super-virial gas persists, highlighting the dominance of alternative heating mechanisms. We also show that cosmic rays do not have a significant effect on heating the gas to a super-virial temperature. Our study illuminates the intricate dynamics of hot virial and super-virial gas surrounding Milky Way-like galaxies, emphasizing the prominent role of infall-driven and compressive heating processes in shaping thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approach for Estimating Magnetic Field Strength in Galaxy Clusters from Synchrotron Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a crucial role in various astrophysical processes within the intracluster medium, including heat conduction, cosmic ray acceleration, and the generation of synchrotron radiation. However, measuring magnetic field strength is typically challenging due to the limited availability of Faraday Rotation Measure sources. To address the challenge, we propose a novel method that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) alongside synchrotron emission observations to estimate magnetic field strengths in galaxy clusters. Our CNN model is trained on either magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations or MHD galaxy cluster simulations, which incorporate complex dynamics such as cluster mergers and sloshing motions. The results demonstrate that CNNs can effectively estimate magnetic field strengths with mean squared error of approximately \SI{0.135}{\micro G}$^2$, \SI{0.044}{\micro G}$^2$, and \SI{0.02}{\micro G}$^2$ for $\beta = 100$, 200, and 500 conditions, respectively. Additionally, we have confirmed that our CNN model remains robust against noise and variations in viewing angles with sufficient training, ensuring reliable performance under a wide range of observational conditions. We compare the CNN approach with the traditional magnetic field strength estimates method that assumes equipartition between cosmic ray electron energy and magnetic field energy. Different from the equipartition method, this CNN approach relies on the morphological feature of synchrotron images, offering a new perspective for complementing traditional estimates and enhancing our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Central Cluster Galaxies: A Hotspot for Detectable Gravitational Waves from Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have announced the evidence for a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB), the continuous waves (CWs) are the next anticipated gravitational wave (GW) signals. In this work, we model CW sources detectable by PTAs based on the massive black hole (MBH) merger population in the ASTRID cosmological simulation. We evolve MBH binaries, simulate their GW emissions, and calculate their detection probability (DP) for PTAs. The most detectable CW sources are produced by MBH mergers with masses M_BH &gt; 10^10 solarmass in the lowest frequency bins with f&lt;10 nHz. Remarkably, these mergers occur within massive galaxies with the stellar mass larger than 10^12 solarmass located at the center of galaxy clusters. Particularly striking in ASTRID is a triple merger event, wherein two consecutive mergers occur within 500 Myr interval in the same cluster core, generating high-DP CW signals at ~ 2nHz and ~ 10nHz. We also investigate the electromagnetic (EM) signatures associated with these events: either single or dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the massive host galaxies that are undergoing star formation. This research provides new insights into the low-frequency GW sky and informs future multi-messenger searches for PTA CW sources.</description>

      <title>Gas outflows in two recently quenched galaxies at z = 4 and 7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10.2}M_\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\sim15\,M_\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $&lt;12\,M_\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\lesssim1$ and $&gt;10$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernova feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is likely not the primary factor behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

      <title>Sleeping Giants Arise: Monitoring the Return of Three Changing-Look Quasars to Their High States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing-look quasars challenge many models of the quasar central engine. Their extreme variability in both the continuum and broad emission-line fluxes on timescales on the order of years is difficult to explain. To investigate the cause of the observed transitions, we present new contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations of three faded changing-look quasars as they return to a state of high optical luminosity. Two of these three remained in a quiescent state for more than ten years before returning to a new high state. We find that before, during, and after transition, the spectral energy distributions of all three follow predictions for quasars based on X-ray binary outbursts, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is likely a changing accretion rate causing changes in the accretion flow structure. In two of the three cases, the transition between the initial high and low state and the transition between the low and new high state took nearly identical amounts of time, on the order of hundreds of days. This transition timescale is a useful constraint on models of the accretion state changes. The behavior of the broad line profiles suggests that the BLR structure is changing during the transition.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved [CII]-gas conversion factor in early galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining how efficiently gas collapses into stars at high-redshift is key to understanding galaxy evolution in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Globally, this process is quantified by the gas depletion time ($t_{dep}$); on resolved scales, by the slope and normalization of the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation. This work explores the global ($\alpha_{[CII]}$) and spatially resolved ($W_{[CII]}$) [CII]-to-gas conversion factors at high-$z$ and their role in inferring reliable gas masses, surface densities, and $t_{dep}$ in the EoR. We select galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;9 from the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulation, that features on-the-fly radiative transfer and resolves interstellar medium properties down to $\approx$30 pc. The [CII] emission modelling from photodissociation regions allow us to derive global $\alpha_{ [CII]}$, and maps of $W_{[CII]}$. We study their dependence on gas metallicity (Z), density (n), Mach number (M), and burstiness parameter ($k_s$), and provide best fit relations. The $\alpha_{[CII]}$ decreases with increasing $Z$ and galaxy compactness, while the resolved $W_{[CII]}$ shows two regimes: at $Z&lt; 0.2 Z_\odot$, it anticorrelates with n and Z, but not with $k_s$; above this threshold, it also depends on $k_s$, with more bursty regions showing lower conversion factors. This implies $W_{[CII]}\propto \Sigma_{[CII]}^{-0.5}$, as dense, metal-rich, and bursty regions exhibit higher [CII] surface brightness. Applying a constant $\alpha_{[CII]}$ overestimates $\Sigma_{gas}$ in bright $\Sigma_{[CII]}$ patches, thus flattening the KS slope and overestimating $t_{dep}$ by a factor of $\approx$4.</description>

Abstract: We present an analysis of the H$\alpha$-emitting ionized gas in the warm phase of the NGC 253 outflow using integral field spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In each spaxel, we decompose H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] emission lines into a system of up to 3 Gaussian components, accounting for the velocity contributions due to the disk and both intercepted walls of an outflow cone. In the approaching southern lobe of the outflow, we find maximum deprojected outflow velocities down to ~ -500 km/s. Velocity gradients of this outflowing gas range from ~ -350 to -550 km/s/kpc with increasing distance from the nucleus. Additionally, [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ integrated line ratios are suggestive of shocks as the dominant ionization source throughout the wind. Electron densities, inferred from the [S II] doublet, peak at 2100 cm$^{-3}$ near the nucleus and reach $\lesssim 50 $cm$^{-3}$ in the wind. Finally, at an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on the inferred mass of $4\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the mass-outflow rate of the H$\alpha$-emitting gas in the southern outflow lobe is ~ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$/year. This yields a mass-loading factor of $\eta$ ~ 0.1 and a ~ 2% starburst energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>High-Velocity Molecular Clouds in M83</title>

Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs), which are gas clouds moving at high velocity relative to the galactic disk, may play a critical role in galaxy evolution, potentially supplying gas to the disk and triggering star formation. In this study, we focus on the nearby face-on barred spiral galaxy M83, where high spatial resolution, high-sensitivity CO (1-0) data are available. We identified molecular clouds and searched for clouds with velocities deviating by more than 50km/s from the disk velocity field as HVCs. A total of 10 HVCs were detected -- nine redshifted and one blueshifted -- clearly highlighting an asymmetry in their velocity distribution. These HVCs have radii of 30-80 pc, masses on the order of $10^5 M_\odot$, and velocity dispersions of 3-20 km/s, displaying a tendency toward higher velocity dispersion compared to disk molecular clouds in M83. Most of the HVCs do not overlap with the candidates of supernova remnants, and the energy needed to drive HVCs at such high velocities exceeds single supernova energy. Together with the asymmetry in their velocity distribution, we thus conclude that most of the HVCs found in this study are inflow from outside the M83's disk.</description>

      <title>Evolution of star clusters with initial bulk rotation via N-body simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity massive single stars with rotation. III. Source of ionization and C-IV emission in I Zw 18</title>

Abstract: Chemically-homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy, I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O-&gt;WN-&gt;WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem.-hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.</description>

      <title>Distinguish dark matter theories with the cosmic web and next-generation surveys I: an alternative theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04837</link>

Abstract: In the context of future large surveys like the Euclid mission, extracting the cosmic web from galaxies at higher redshifts with more statistical power will become feasible, particularly within the group-cluster mass regime. Therefore, it is imperative to enlarge the number of metrics that can used to constrain our cosmological models at these large scales. The number of cosmic filaments surrounding galaxies, groups and clusters, namely the connectivity, has recently emerged as a compelling probe of the large-scale structures, and has been investigated in various observational and numerical analyses. In this first paper, we examine dark matter-only cosmological simulations using the widely used DisPerSE filament finder code under two theories of gravity: the Poisson ($\Lambda$CDM) and the Monge-Amp\`ere models, in order to quantify how alternative models of gravity alter the properties of the cosmic skeleton. We specifically focused on this alternative gravity theory due to its propensity to enhance the formation of anisotropic structures such as filaments, but it also makes them more resistant to collapse, which consequently reduces the formation of halos. Indeed, our findings reveal that replacing the Poisson equation has a significant impact on the hierarchical formation scenario. This is evidenced by examining the redshift evolution of both the slope and the offset of the connectivity. Additionally, we demonstrated that current observations are generally in better agreement with our well-established gravity model. Finally, our study suggests that filament connectivity in the group-cluster regime could serve as a probe of our gravity model at cosmological scales. We also emphasize that our approach could be extended to alternative theories of dark matter, such as warm or fuzzy dark matter, given the extraordinary datasets provided by next-generation surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei as a New Probe of Inelastic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.</description>

      <title>SECRET: Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons depends sensitively on the history and spatial distribution of nearby sources. Given our limited observational handle on cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously, predictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions from individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical ensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if the cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum energy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive. In addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with such probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the full spectrum instead of only samples. Note that parametrising this joint distribution is rendered difficult by the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic-ray fluxes. Here, we employ machine learning to compute the joint probability distribution of cosmic-ray electron fluxes. Specifically, we employ masked autoregressive density estimation (MADE) for a representation of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In a first step, we train the network on a Monte Carlo simulation for a fixed set of transport parameters, thus significantly accelerating the generation of samples. In a second step, we extend this setup to SECRET (Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons), allowing to reliably interpolate over the space of transport parameters. We make the MADE and SECRET codes available at https://git.rwth-aachen.de/pmertsch/secret .</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.</description>
