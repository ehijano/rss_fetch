      <title>A new rotation-free isogeometric thin shell formulation and a corresponding continuity constraint for patch boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a general non-linear computational formulation for rotation-free thin shells based on isogeometric finite elements. It is a displacement-based formulation that admits general material models. The formulation allows for a wide range of constitutive laws, including both shell models that are extracted from existing 3D continua using numerical integration and those that are directly formulated in 2D manifold form, like the Koiter, Canham and Helfrich models. Further, a unified approach to enforce the $G^1$-continuity between patches, fix the angle between surface folds, enforce symmetry conditions and prescribe rotational Dirichlet boundary conditions, is presented using penalty and Lagrange multiplier methods. The formulation is fully described in the natural curvilinear coordinate system of the finite element description, which facilitates an efficient computational implementation. It contains existing isogeometric thin shell formulations as special cases. Several classical numerical benchmark examples are considered to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed formulation. The presented constitutive models, in particular the simple mixed Koiter model that does not require any thickness integration, show excellent performance, even for large deformations.</description>

      <title>A Key Conditional Quotient Filter for Nonlinear, non-Gaussian and non-Markovian System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and efficient key conditional quotient filter (KCQF) for the estimation of state in the nonlinear system which can be either Gaussian or non-Gaussian, and either Markovian or non-Markovian. The core idea of the proposed KCQF is that only the key measurement conditions, rather than all measurement conditions, should be used to estimate the state. Based on key measurement conditions, the quotient-form analytical integral expressions for the conditional probability density function, mean, and variance of state are derived by using the principle of probability conservation, and are calculated by using the Monte Carlo method, which thereby constructs the KCQF. Two nonlinear numerical examples were given to demonstrate the superior estimation accuracy of KCQF, compared to seven existing filters.</description>

      <title>KabaddiPy: A package to enable access to Professional Kabaddi Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kabaddi, a contact team sport of Indian origin, has seen a dramatic rise in global popularity, highlighted by the upcoming Kabaddi World Cup in 2025 with over sixteen international teams participating, alongside flourishing national leagues such as the Indian Pro Kabaddi League (230 million viewers) and the British Kabaddi League. We present the first open-source Python module to make Kabaddi statistical data easily accessible from multiple scattered sources across the internet. The module was developed by systematically web-scraping and collecting team-wise, player-wise and match-by-match data. The data has been cleaned, organized, and categorized into team overviews and player metrics, each filterable by season. The players are classified as raiders and defenders, with their best strategies for attacking, counter-attacking, and defending against different teams highlighted. Our module enables continuous monitoring of exponentially growing data streams, aiding researchers to quickly start building upon the data to answer critical questions, such as the impact of player inclusion/exclusion on team performance, scoring patterns against specific teams, and break down opponent gameplay. The data generated from Kabaddi tournaments has been sparsely used, and coaches and players rely heavily on intuition to make decisions and craft strategies. Our module can be utilized to build predictive models, craft uniquely strategic gameplays to target opponents and identify hidden correlations in the data. This open source module has the potential to increase time-efficiency, encourage analytical studies of Kabaddi gameplay and player dynamics and foster reproducible research. The data and code are publicly available: https://github.com/kabaddiPy/kabaddiPy</description>

      <title>Implementation Pitfalls for Carbonate Mineral Dissolution -- a Technical Note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In systems with slow reaction kinetics, such as mineral dissolution processes, chemical equilibrium cannot be assumed and an accurate understanding of reaction rates is essential; discrepancies in parameter reporting can greatly affect simulation results. This technical note identifies an issue with the reporting of rate parameters for carbonate mineral dissolution in a widely used database for reactive transport modeling based on Palandri and Kharaka 2004. This misrepresentation leads to a considerable overestimation of reaction timescales. Using the simulators Reaktoro and DuMuX, we simulated a simple calcite dissolution batch test and compared the results to experimental data. By adjusting the parameter to align with established literature, we demonstrate an improved fit between simulated and experimental data. Discrepancies in reaction timescales were reduced by an order of magnitude, emphasizing the importance of regular validation of simulations with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Local particle refinement in terramechanical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete element method (DEM) is a powerful tool for simulating granular soils, but its high computational demand often results in extended simulation times. While the effect of particle size has been extensively studied, the potential benefits of spatially scaling particle sizes are less explored. We systematically investigate a local particle refinement method's impact on reducing computational effort while maintaining accuracy. We first conduct triaxial tests to verify that bulk mechanical properties are preserved under local particle refinement. Then, we perform pressure-sinkage and shear-displacement tests, comparing our method to control simulations with homogeneous particle size. We evaluate $36$ different DEM beds with varying aggressiveness in particle refinement. Our results show that this approach, depending on refinement aggressiveness, can significantly reduce particle count by $2.3$ to $25$ times and simulation times by $3.1$ to $43$ times, with normalized errors ranging from $3.4$\% to $11$\% compared to high-resolution reference simulations. The approach maintains a high resolution at the soil surface, where interaction is high, while allowing larger particles below the surface. The results demonstrate that substantial computational savings can be achieved without significantly compromising simulation accuracy. This method can enhance the efficiency of DEM simulations in terramechanics applications.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Gradient Boosting Algorithms for Estimating Strength of Modified Subgrade Soil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of pavement under loading depends on the strength of the subgrade. However, experimental estimation of properties of pavement strengths such as California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and resistance value (R) are often tedious, time-consuming and costly, thereby inspiring a growing interest in machine learning based tools which are simple, cheap and fast alternatives. Thus, the potential application of two boosting techniques; categorical boosting (CatBoost) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and support vector regression (SVR), is similarly explored in this study for estimation of properties of subgrade soil modified with hydrated lime activated rice husk ash (HARSH). Using 121 experimental data samples of varying proportions of HARSH, plastic limit, liquid limit, plasticity index, clay activity, optimum moisture content, and maximum dry density as input for CBR, UCS and R estimation, four evaluation metrics namely coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the models' performance. The results indicate that XGBoost outperformed CatBoost and SVR in estimating these properties, yielding R2 of 0.9994, 0.9995 and 0.9999 in estimating the CBR, UCS and R respectively. Also, SVR outperformed CatBoost in estimating the CBR and R with R2 of 0.9997 respectively. On the other hand, CatBoost outperformed SVR in estimating the UCS with R2 of 0.9994. Feature sensitivity analysis shows that the three machine learning techniques are unanimous that increasing HARSH proportion lead to values of the estimated properties respectively. A comparison with previous results also shows superiority of XGBoost in estimating subgrade properties.</description>

      <title>A hybrid pressure formulation of the face-centred finite volume method for viscous laminar incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a hybrid pressure face-centred finite volume (FCFV) solver to simulate steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. The method leverages the robustness, in the incompressible limit, of the hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin paradigm for compressible and weakly compressible flows to derive the formulation of a novel, low-order face-based discretisation. The incompressibility constraint is enforced in a weak sense, by introducing an inter-cell mass flux defined in terms of a new, hybrid variable, representing the pressure at the cell faces. This results in a new hybridisation strategy where cell variables (velocity, pressure and deviatoric strain rate tensor) are expressed as a function of velocity and pressure at the barycentre of the cell faces. The hybrid pressure formulation provides first-order convergence of all variables, including the stress, independently of cell type, stretching and distortion. Numerical benchmarks of Navier-Stokes flows at low and moderate Reynolds numbers, in two and three dimensions, are presented to evaluate accuracy and robustness of the method. In particular, the hybrid pressure formulation outperforms the FCFV method when convective effects are relevant, achieving accurate predictions on significantly coarser meshes.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Domain-adaptive Post-training for Financial LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach begins by identifying the core capabilities required for the target domain and designing a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with these needs. We then analyze the effectiveness of key post-training stages, including continual pretraining, instruction tuning, and preference alignment. Building on these insights, we propose an effective training recipe centered on a novel preference data distillation method, which leverages process signals from a generative reward model. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs. Project page: https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/FinDap</description>

      <title>Experiment-informed finite-strain inverse design of spinodal metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinodal metamaterials, with architectures inspired by natural phase-separation processes, have presented a significant alternative to periodic and symmetric morphologies when designing mechanical metamaterials with extreme performance. While their elastic mechanical properties have been systematically determined, their large-deformation, nonlinear responses have been challenging to predict and design, in part due to limited data sets and the need for complex nonlinear simulations. This work presents a novel physics-enhanced machine learning (ML) and optimization framework tailored to address the challenges of designing intricate spinodal metamaterials with customized mechanical properties in large-deformation scenarios where computational modeling is restrictive and experimental data is sparse. By utilizing large-deformation experimental data directly, this approach facilitates the inverse design of spinodal structures with precise finite-strain mechanical responses. The framework sheds light on instability-induced pattern formation in spinodal metamaterials -- observed experimentally and in selected nonlinear simulations -- leveraging physics-based inductive biases in the form of nonconvex energetic potentials. Altogether, this combined ML, experimental, and computational effort provides a route for efficient and accurate design of complex spinodal metamaterials for large-deformation scenarios where energy absorption and prediction of nonlinear failure mechanisms is essential.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil RL: Backdoor attack via Stock market, Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example, well-known financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>

      <title>TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading. More details on TradingAgents are available at https://TradingAgents-AI.github.io.</description>

      <title>An OpenFOAM face-centred solver for incompressible flows robust to mesh distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents an overview of mesh-induced errors commonly experienced by cell-centred finite volumes (CCFV), for which the face-centred finite volume (FCFV) paradigm offers competitive solutions. In particular, a robust FCFV solver for incompressible laminar flows is integrated in OpenFOAM and tested on a set of steady-state and transient benchmarks. The method outperforms standard simpleFoam and pimpleFoam algorithms in terms of optimal convergence, accuracy, stability, and robustness. Special attention is devoted to motivate and numerically demonstrate the ability of the FCFV method to treat non-orthogonal, stretched, and skewed meshes, where CCFV schemes exhibit shortcomings.</description>
