      <title>Nonnegative extensions of Sturm-Liouville operators with an application to problems with symmetric coefficient functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study nonnegative self-adjoint extensions associated with singular Sturm-Liouville expressions with strictly positive minimal operators. We provide a full characterization of all possible nonnegative self-adjoint extensions of the minimal operator in terms of generalized boundary values, as well as a parameterization of all nonnegative extensions when fixing a boundary condition at one endpoint. In addition, we investigate problems where the coefficient functions are symmetric about the midpoint of a finite interval, illustrating how every self-adjoint operator of this form is unitarily equivalent to the direct sum of two self-adjoint operators restricted to half of the interval. We also extend these result to symmetric two interval problems. We then apply our previous results to parameterize all nonnegative extensions of operators with symmetric coefficient functions. We end with an example of an operator with a symmetric Bessel-type potential (i.e., symmetric confining potential) and an application to integral inequalities.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical inequalities for Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in inequalities that bound the Riesz means of the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplaciancs in terms of their semiclassical counterpart. We show that the classical inequalities of Berezin-Li-Yau and Kr\"oger, valid for Riesz exponents $\gamma\geq 1$, extend to certain values $\gamma&lt;1$, provided the underlying domain is convex. We also characterize the implications of a possible failure of P\'olya's conjecture for convex sets in terms of Riesz means. These findings allow us to describe the asymptotic behavior of solutions of a spectral shape optimization problem for convex sets.</description>

      <title>On spectral representation and sampling for unbounded continuous time signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies spectral representation as well as sampling and interpolation problems for non-vanishing continuous time signals. The notions of transfer functions, the spectrum gaps, and bandlimitness are introduced for these signals. As an application, an analog Sampling Theorem and a modification of Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula for unbounded signals is obtained.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Neural Kernels (G-FuNK): Learning Solutions of Nonlinear Diffusive Parametric PDEs on Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting time-dependent dynamics of complex systems governed by non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with varying parameters and domains is a challenging task motivated by applications across various fields. We introduce a novel family of neural operators based on our Graph Fourier Neural Kernels, designed to learn solution generators for nonlinear PDEs in which the highest-order term is diffusive, across multiple domains and parameters. G-FuNK combines components that are parameter- and domain-adapted with others that are not. The domain-adapted components are constructed using a weighted graph on the discretized domain, where the graph Laplacian approximates the highest-order diffusive term, ensuring boundary condition compliance and capturing the parameter and domain-specific behavior. Meanwhile, the learned components transfer across domains and parameters via Fourier Neural Operators. This approach naturally embeds geometric and directional information, improving generalization to new test domains without need for retraining the network. To handle temporal dynamics, our method incorporates an integrated ODE solver to predict the evolution of the system. Experiments show G-FuNK's capability to accurately approximate heat, reaction diffusion, and cardiac electrophysiology equations across various geometries and anisotropic diffusivity fields. G-FuNK achieves low relative errors on unseen domains and fiber fields, significantly accelerating predictions compared to traditional finite-element solvers.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation in Local Statistics for random operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the local spectral statistics in the localised region of various random operator models, including the $d$-dimensional the Anderson model and random Schr\"odinger operators. It is already established, in the above models, that at an energy $E$, in the localised energy region of the spectrum, where the density of states $n(E) &gt; 0$, the local eigenvalue statistics $X_E$ is a Poisson processes with intensity $n(E) \mathcal{L}$, $\mathcal{L}$ being the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. The question of independence of $X_E, X_{E^\prime}$ for distinct energies was partially solved in the literature. We solve it completely for all the models for which the Minami technique works.</description>

      <title>Perron similarities and the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) is to determine which multisets of complex numbers occur as the spectrum of an entry-wise nonnegative matrix. Although there are some well-known necessary conditions, a solution to the NIEP is far from known.
  An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Johnson and Paparella developed the theory of real Perron similarities. Here, we fully develop the theory of complex Perron similarities.
  Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone and polytope of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). The extremals of these convex sets are finite in number, and their determination for each Perron similarity would solve the diagonalizable NIEP, a major portion of the entire problem. By considering Perron similarities of certain realizing matrices of Type I Karpelevich arcs, large portions of realizable spectra are generated for a given positive integer. This is demonstrated by producing a nearly complete geometrical representation of the spectra of $4 \times 4$ stochastic matrices.
  Similar to the Karpelevich region, it is shown that the subset of complex Euclidean space comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices is compact and star-shaped. Extremal elements of the set are defined and shown to be on the boundary.
  It is shown that the polyhedral cone and convex polytope of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix corresponds to the conical hull and convex hull of its rows, respectively. Similar results are established for multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and Walsh matrices. These polytopes are of great significance with respect to the NIEP because they are extremal in the region comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a self-similar Cantor set in $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ has a fractal uncertainty principle if and only if it does not contain a pair of orthogonal lines. The key ingredient in our proof is a quantitative form of Lang's conjecture in number theory due to Ruppert and Beukers &amp; Smyth. Our theorem answers a question of Dyatlov and has applications to open quantum maps.</description>

      <title>Long time behaviour of the solution of Maxwell's equations in dissipative generalized Lorentz materials (II) A modal approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work concerns the analysis of electromagnetic dispersive media modelled by generalized Lorentz models. More precisely, this paper is the second of two articles dedicated to the long time behaviour of solutions of Maxwell's equations in dissipative Lorentz media, via the long time decay rate of the electromagnetic energy for the corresponding Cauchy problem. In opposition to the frequency dependent Lyapunov functions approach used in [Cassier, Joly, Rosas Mart\'inez, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 74 (2023), 115], we develop a method based on the spectral analysis of the underlying non-self-adjoint operator of the model. Although more involved, this approach is closer to physics, as it uses the dispersion relation of the model, and has the advantage to provide more precise and more optimal results, leading to distinguish the notion of weak and strong dissipation.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to the spectral properties of self-adjoint Koopman operators. Hermitian DMD is a data-driven method that approximates the Koopman operator associated with an unknown nonlinear dynamical system, using discrete-time snapshots. This approach preserves the self-adjointness of the operator in its finite-dimensional approximations. \rev{We prove that, under suitably broad conditions, the spectral measures corresponding to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions computed by Hermitian DMD converge to those of the underlying Koopman operator}. This result also applies to skew-Hermitian systems (after multiplication by $i$), applicable to generators of continuous-time measure-preserving systems. Along the way, we establish a general theorem on the convergence of spectral measures for finite sections of self-adjoint operators, including those that are unbounded, which is of independent interest to the wider spectral community. We numerically demonstrate our results by applying them to two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Controllability and feedback stabilizability in a nonuniform framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new controllability property for linear time varying control systems in finite dimension: the nonuniform complete controllability, which is halfway between the classical Kalman's properties of complete controllability and uniform complete controllability. This new concept is described in terms of two gramian inequalities, which have a strong relation; as we prove in our first result; with the property of nonuniform bounded growth for the corresponding plant, also called uncontrolled part. On the other hand, the second result proves that if a control system is nonuniformly completely controllable and its plant has the property of nonuniform bounded growth, then there exist a linear feedback control leading to a nonuniformly exponentially stable closed--loop system.</description>

Abstract: We study analytic torsion and eta like invariants on CR contact manifolds of any dimension admitting a circle transverse action, and equipped with a unitary representation. We show that, when defined using the spectrum of relevant operators arising in this geometry, the spectral series involved can been interpreted in their whole, both from a topological viewpoint, and as purely dynamical functions of the Reeb flow.</description>
