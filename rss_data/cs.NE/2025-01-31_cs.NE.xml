      <title>Perforated Backpropagation: A Neuroscience Inspired Extension to Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neurons of artificial neural networks were originally invented when much less was known about biological neurons than is known today. Our work explores a modification to the core neuron unit to make it more parallel to a biological neuron. The modification is made with the knowledge that biological dendrites are not simply passive activation funnels, but also compute complex non-linear functions as they transmit activation to the cell body. The paper explores a novel system of "Perforated" backpropagation empowering the artificial neurons of deep neural networks to achieve better performance coding for the same features they coded for in the original architecture. After an initial network training phase, additional "Dendrite Nodes" are added to the network and separately trained with a different objective: to correlate their output with the remaining error of the original neurons. The trained Dendrite Nodes are then frozen, and the original neurons are further trained, now taking into account the additional error signals provided by the Dendrite Nodes. The cycle of training the original neurons and then adding and training Dendrite Nodes can be repeated several times until satisfactory performance is achieved. Our algorithm was successfully added to modern state-of-the-art PyTorch networks across multiple domains, improving upon original accuracies and allowing for significant model compression without a loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>ISAM-MTL: Cross-subject multi-task learning model with identifiable spikes and associative memory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-subject variability in EEG degrades performance of current deep learning models, limiting the development of brain-computer interface (BCI). This paper proposes ISAM-MTL, which is a multi-task learning (MTL) EEG classification model based on identifiable spiking (IS) representations and associative memory (AM) networks. The proposed model treats EEG classification of each subject as an independent task and leverages cross-subject data training to facilitate feature sharing across subjects. ISAM-MTL consists of a spiking feature extractor that captures shared features across subjects and a subject-specific bidirectional associative memory network that is trained by Hebbian learning for efficient and fast within-subject EEG classification. ISAM-MTL integrates learned spiking neural representations with bidirectional associative memory for cross-subject EEG classification. The model employs label-guided variational inference to construct identifiable spike representations, enhancing classification accuracy. Experimental results on two BCI Competition datasets demonstrate that ISAM-MTL improves the average accuracy of cross-subject EEG classification while reducing performance variability among subjects. The model further exhibits the characteristics of few-shot learning and identifiable neural activity beneath EEG, enabling rapid and interpretable calibration for BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Degree is Important: On Evolving Homogeneous Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean functions with good cryptographic properties like high nonlinearity and algebraic degree play an important in the security of stream and block ciphers. Such functions may be designed, for instance, by algebraic constructions or metaheuristics. This paper investigates the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to design homogeneous bent Boolean functions, i.e., functions that are maximally nonlinear and whose algebraic normal form contains only monomials of the same degree. In our work, we evaluate three genotype encodings and four fitness functions. Our results show that while EAs manage to find quadratic homogeneous bent functions (with the best method being a GA leveraging a restricted encoding), none of the approaches result in cubic homogeneous bent functions.</description>

      <title>Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard genetic programming (stdGP), solutions are varied by modifying their syntax, with uncertain effects on their semantics. Geometric-semantic genetic programming (GSGP), a popular variant of GP, effectively searches the semantic solution space using variation operations based on linear combinations, although it results in significantly larger solutions. This paper presents Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP), a novel and flexible semantic approach that uses a generative transformer model as search operator. The transformer is trained on synthetic test problems and learns semantic similarities between solutions. Once the model is trained, it can be used to create offspring solutions with high semantic similarity also for unseen and unknown problems. Experiments on several symbolic regression problems show that TSGP generates solutions with comparable or even significantly better prediction quality than stdGP, SLIM_GSGP, DSR, and DAE-GP. Like SLIM_GSGP, TSGP is able to create new solutions that are semantically similar without creating solutions of large size. An analysis of the search dynamic reveals that the solutions generated by TSGP are semantically more similar than the solutions generated by the benchmark approaches allowing a better exploration of the semantic solution space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to improving Genetic Algorithms (GA) in large or complex problem spaces by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process through border trade activities. These strategies increase chromosome diversity, preventing premature convergence and enhancing the GA's ability to explore the solution space more effectively. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in convergence behavior. This approach offers a promising pathway to addressing challenges in optimizing large or complex problem domains.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking LLMs' Safeguard with Universal Magic Words for Text Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained significant attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful outputs, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.</description>

      <title>Real Time Scheduling Framework for Multi Object Detection via Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the energy constraints in autonomous mobile agents (AMAs), such as unmanned vehicles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly favored as a more efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. AMAs employ multi-object detection (MOD) from multiple cameras to identify nearby objects while ensuring two essential objectives, (R1) timing guarantee and (R2) high accuracy for safety. In this paper, we propose RT-SNN, the first system design, aiming at achieving R1 and R2 in SNN-based MOD systems on AMAs. Leveraging the characteristic that SNNs gather feature data of input image termed as membrane potential, through iterative computation over multiple timesteps, RT-SNN provides multiple execution options with adjustable timesteps and a novel method for reusing membrane potential to support R1. Then, it captures how these execution strategies influence R2 by introducing a novel notion of mean absolute error and membrane confidence. Further, RT-SNN develops a new scheduling framework consisting of offline schedulability analysis for R1 and a run-time scheduling algorithm for R2 using the notion of membrane confidence. We deployed RT-SNN to Spiking-YOLO, the SNN-based MOD model derived from ANN-to-SNN conversion, and our experimental evaluation confirms its effectiveness in meeting the R1 and R2 requirements while providing significant energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>CLEAR: Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition Applied to Sustainability Data Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</description>

      <title>LLaMEA: A Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm for Automatically Generating Metaheuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20132v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have demonstrated their ability to understand natural language and generate complex code snippets. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel black-box metaheuristic optimization algorithms automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy and Differential Evolution) on the five dimensional black box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-dimensional instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs.</description>

      <title>EvoGP: A GPU-accelerated Framework for Tree-Based Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a key evolutionary algorithm widely used in symbolic regression, feature engineering, and scientific modeling. Its high computational demands make GPU acceleration essential for scalable and high-performance evolutionary computation. However, GPU acceleration of TGP faces three key challenges: inefficient tree encoding, highly heterogeneous genetic operations, and limited parallelism in fitness evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce EvoGP, a comprehensive GPU-accelerated TGP framework. First, we design a tensorized encoding scheme to represent tree with different structures as tensors with the same shape, optimizing memory access and enabling efficient parallel execution. Second, we propose a unified parallel framework for genetic operations by leveraging shared computational primitives and implementing dedicated CUDA kernels for scalable performance. Third, we present a fully parallel fitness evaluation strategy for symbolic regression, exploiting both population-level and data-level parallelism to maximize GPU utilization. Moreover, we implement a comprehensive library to provide rich algorithm operators and benchmark problems. EvoGP is extensively tested on various tasks, including symbolic regression, classification, and robotics control, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse application scenarios. Experimental results show that EvoGP achieves up to a 140.89x speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementation, while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of baseline methods. EvoGP is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning With Sine-Activated Low-rank Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank decomposition has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing parameter efficiency in neural network architectures, gaining traction across diverse applications in machine learning. These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.</description>

      <title>Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of team selection within multiagent adversarial team games. We propose BERTeam, a novel algorithm that uses a transformer-based deep neural network with Masked Language Model training to select the best team of players from a trained population. We integrate this with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which trains a diverse set of individual players to choose from. We test our algorithm in the multiagent adversarial game Marine Capture-The-Flag, and find that BERTeam learns non-trivial team compositions that perform well against unseen opponents. For this game, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, an algorithm that similarly optimizes team selection.</description>
