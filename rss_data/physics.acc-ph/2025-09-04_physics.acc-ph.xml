      <title>Steels and Stainless Steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steels, and in particular stainless steels, play a crucial role in the construction of large particle accelerators and high-energy physics experiments, of fusion reactors and their superconducting magnet structures. Such projects face severe material challenges, as they require a wide application of tightly specified steel products and grades, featuring a controlled microstructure and adequate mechanical, physical, magnetic and vacuum properties over a wide temperature range. A broad spectrum of relevant examples is presented, issued from the experience maturated within decades of building of large vacuum, cryogenic and associated structural systems that must guarantee a reliable, long-lasting service with limited interventions. The requirements, and in turn the metallurgical processes applied to achieve the final stringent properties are discussed - dictated by mechanical, magnetic or vacuum compatibility constraints and often by a combination of them. Case studies are developed. The study of a few major failure analysis cases and their root causes is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Wakefield acceleration of self-injected bunch in a conical plasma channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser wakefield acceleration is a widely studied method for accelerating charged particle bunches, with selfinjection being a key feature. However, as the bunch accelerates beyond the driver velocity, it shifts out of the maximal accelerating wakefield phase. This work proposes using a tapering cone channel to address this issue. The gradual narrowing synchronizes the bunch with the wake phase by reducing the bubble size, keeping the bunch in the accelerating phase. The obtained dependencies of the bunch length, field Ez, and mean longitudinal momentum pz on the channel radius are useful for further researches.</description>

      <title>Plasma lens for the focusing of positron bunches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of effective focusing schemes for positron bunches in plasma accelerators remains a significant challenge, as nonlinear regimes fail to create stable focusing channels for positrons. This work presents a method for focusing and improving the quality of positron bunches using a plasma lens operating in the linear regime. Through numerical simulations, we investigate two distinct focused positron bunch profiles: a purely Gaussian bunch and an elongated, flat-top bunch with Gaussian rising and falling edges. For both configurations, the results demonstrate the capability to achieve high-quality transverse focusing. Furthermore, beyond focusing, the proposed system enables potential possibility to reduce energy spread of positron bunches of the sequence after precursor.</description>

      <title>Universal Analytic Solution for the Quantum Transport of Structured Matter-Waves in Magnetic Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a closed-form analytic solution for the propagation of an arbitrary charged scalar state in a non-uniform magnetic field. The dynamics are governed by classical beam optics parameters (Courant-Snyder parameters), the Twiss functions, and phase advance, revealing a direct map between quantum evolution and its classical counterpart. The solution decomposes into three components, exhibiting a complex rotation dependent on the sign of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection, alongside an intrinsic distortion from interference governed by a generalized Gouy phase. For a relevant Glaser-type magnetic field and a half-blocked twisted electron, we demonstrate that asymmetry triggers rich dynamics incompatible with a simple Bohmian trajectory interpretation. Our fully relativistic framework provides a powerful tool for predicting beam behavior in particle accelerators and electron microscopes, critical for designing next-generation OAM-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards Agentic AI on Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06336v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As particle accelerators grow in complexity, traditional control methods face increasing challenges in achieving optimal performance. This paper envisions a paradigm shift: a decentralized multi-agent framework for accelerator control, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed among autonomous agents. We present a proposition of a self-improving decentralized system where intelligent agents handle high-level tasks and communication and each agent is specialized to control individual accelerator components.
  This approach raises some questions: What are the future applications of AI in particle accelerators? How can we implement an autonomous complex system such as a particle accelerator where agents gradually improve through experience and human feedback? What are the implications of integrating a human-in-the-loop component for labeling operational data and providing expert guidance? We show three examples, where we demonstrate the viability of such architecture.</description>

      <title>The Compact Linear e$^+$e$^-$ Collider (CLIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a TeV-scale high-luminosity linear e$^+$e$^-$ collider studied by the international CLIC and CLICdp collaborations. CLIC uses a two-beam acceleration scheme, in which normal-conducting high-gradient 12 GHz accelerating structures are powered via a high-current drive beam. CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in stages. The initial 380 GeV stage, with a site length of 11 km, optimally combines the exploration of Higgs and top-quark physics, including a top threshold scan near 350 GeV. A higher-energy stage, still using the initial single drive-beam complex, can be optimised for any energy up to 2 TeV. Parameters are presented in detail for a 1.5 TeV stage, with a site length of 29 km. Since the 2018 ESPPU reporting, significant effort was invested in CLIC accelerator optimisation, technology developments and system tests, including collaboration with new-generation light sources and free-electron lasers. CLIC implementation aspects at CERN have covered detailed studies of civil engineering, electrical networks, cooling and ventilation, scheduling, and costing. The CLIC baseline at 380 GeV is now 100 Hz operation, with a luminosity of 4.5$\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and a power consumption of 166 MW. Compared to the 2018 design, this gives three times higher luminosity-per-power. The new baseline has two beam-delivery systems, allowing for two detectors operating in parallel. The cost estimate of the 380 GeV baseline is approximately 7.2 billion CHF. The construction of the first CLIC energy stage could start as early as ~2034/35 with first beams following a decade later. This report summarises the CLIC project, its implementation and running scenarios, with emphasis on new developments and recent progress. It concludes with an update on the CLIC detector studies and on the physics potential in light of the improved accelerator performance.</description>
