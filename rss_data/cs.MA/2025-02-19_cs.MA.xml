      <title>Hypernetwork-based approach for optimal composition design in partially controlled multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems (PCMAS) are comprised of controllable agents, managed by a system designer, and uncontrollable agents, operating autonomously. This study addresses an optimal composition design problem in PCMAS, which involves the system designer's problem, determining the optimal number and policies of controllable agents, and the uncontrollable agents' problem, identifying their best-response policies. Solving this bi-level optimization problem is computationally intensive, as it requires repeatedly solving multi-agent reinforcement learning problems under various compositions for both types of agents. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hypernetwork-based framework that jointly optimizes the system's composition and agent policies. Unlike traditional methods that train separate policy networks for each composition, the proposed framework generates policies for both controllable and uncontrollable agents through a unified hypernetwork. This approach enables efficient information sharing across similar configurations, thereby reducing computational overhead. Additional improvements are achieved by incorporating reward parameter optimization and mean action networks. Using real-world New York City taxi data, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in approximating equilibrium policies. Our experimental results show significant improvements in key performance metrics, such as order response rate and served demand, highlighting the practical utility of controlling agents and their potential to enhance decision-making in PCMAS.</description>

      <title>Towards Hybrid Traffic Laws for Mixed Flow of Human-Driven Vehicles and Connected Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid traffic laws represent an innovative approach to managing mixed environments of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) by introducing separate sets of regulations for each vehicle type. These laws are designed to leverage the unique capabilities of CAVs while ensuring both types of cars coexist effectively, ultimately aiming to enhance overall social welfare. This study uses the SUMO simulation platform to explore hybrid traffic laws in a restricted lane scenario. It evaluates static and dynamic lane access policies under varying traffic demands and CAV proportions. The policies aim to minimize average passenger delay and encourage the incorporation of autonomous vehicles with higher occupancy rates. Results demonstrate that dynamic policies significantly improve traffic flow, especially at low CAV proportions, compared to traditional dedicated bus lane strategies. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid traffic laws to enhance traffic efficiency and accelerate the transition to autonomous technology.</description>

      <title>Direct Preference Optimization-Enhanced Multi-Guided Diffusion Model for Traffic Scenario Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based models are recognized for their effectiveness in using real-world driving data to generate realistic and diverse traffic scenarios. These models employ guided sampling to incorporate specific traffic preferences and enhance scenario realism. However, guiding the sampling process to conform to traffic rules and preferences can result in deviations from real-world traffic priors and potentially leading to unrealistic behaviors. To address this challenge, we introduce a multi-guided diffusion model that utilizes a novel training strategy to closely adhere to traffic priors, even when employing various combinations of guides. This model adopts a multi-task learning framework, enabling a single diffusion model to process various guide inputs. For increased guided sampling precision, our model is fine-tuned using the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. This algorithm optimizes preferences based on guide scores, effectively navigating the complexities and challenges associated with the expensive and often non-differentiable gradient calculations during the guided sampling fine-tuning process. Evaluated using the nuScenes dataset our model provides a strong baseline for balancing realism, diversity and controllability in the traffic scenario generation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Expert Knowledge into Logical Programs via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ExKLoP, a novel framework designed to evaluate how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate expert knowledge into logical reasoning systems. This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal that while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they frequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore, iterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%). Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered. The complete implementation, along with all relevant data, is available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Rational Capability in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend concurrent game structures (CGSs) with a simple notion of preference over computations and define a minimal notion of rationality for agents based on the concept of dominance. We use this notion to interpret a CL and an ATL languages that extend the basic CL and ATL languages with modalities for rational capability, namely, a coalition's capability to rationally enforce a given property. For each of these languages, we provide results about the complexity of satisfiability checking and model checking as well as about axiomatization.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Bayesian Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of optimising the average payoff for a large number of cooperating agents, where the payoff function is unknown and treated as a black box. While standard Bayesian Optimisation (BO) methods struggle with the scalability required for high-dimensional input spaces, we demonstrate how leveraging the mean-field assumption on the black-box function can transform BO into an efficient and scalable solution. Specifically, we introduce MF-GP-UCB, a novel efficient algorithm designed to optimise agent payoffs in this setting. Our theoretical analysis establishes a regret bound for MF-GP-UCB that is independent of the number of agents, contrasting sharply with the exponential dependence observed when naive BO methods are applied. We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse set of tasks, including real-world problems, such as optimising the location of public bikes for a bike-sharing programme, distributing taxi fleets, and selecting refuelling ports for maritime vessels. Empirical results demonstrate that MF-GP-UCB significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, offering substantial improvements in performance and scalability, constituting a promising solution for mean-field, black-box optimisation. The code is available at https://github.com/petarsteinberg/MF-BO.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Value in Challenge the Champ Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tournament is a method to decide the winner in a competition, and describes the overall sequence in which matches between the players are held. While deciding a worthy winner is the primary goal of a tournament, a close second is to maximize the value generated for the matches played, with value for a match measured either in terms of tickets sold, television viewership, advertising revenue, or other means. Tournament organizers often seed the players -- i.e., decide which matches are played -- to increase this value.
  We study the value maximization objective in a particular tournament format called Challenge the Champ. This is a simple tournament format where an ordering of the players is decided. The first player in this order is the initial champion. The remaining players in order challenge the current champion; if a challenger wins, she replaces the current champion. We model the outcome of a match between two players using a complete directed graph, called a strength graph, with each player represented as a vertex, and the direction of an edge indicating the winner in a match. The value-maximization objective has been recently explored for knockout tournaments when the strength graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
  We extend the investigation to Challenge the Champ tournaments and general strength graphs. We study different representations of the value of each match, and completely characterize the computational complexity of the problem.</description>

      <title>Implicit Repair with Reinforcement Learning in Emergent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational repair is a mechanism used to detect and resolve miscommunication and misinformation problems when two or more agents interact. One particular and underexplored form of repair in emergent communication is the implicit repair mechanism, where the interlocutor purposely conveys the desired information in such a way as to prevent misinformation from any other interlocutor. This work explores how redundancy can modify the emergent communication protocol to continue conveying the necessary information to complete the underlying task, even with additional external environmental pressures such as noise. We focus on extending the signaling game, called the Lewis Game, by adding noise in the communication channel and inputs received by the agents. Our analysis shows that agents add redundancy to the transmitted messages as an outcome to prevent the negative impact of noise on the task success. Additionally, we observe that the emerging communication protocol's generalization capabilities remain equivalent to architectures employed in simpler games that are entirely deterministic. Additionally, our method is the only one suitable for producing robust communication protocols that can handle cases with and without noise while maintaining increased generalization performance levels.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Knowledge Graphs Enhance Medical Question Answering: Bridging the Gap Between LLMs and Evolving Medical Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced medical question-answering by leveraging extensive clinical data and medical literature. However, the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and the labor-intensive process of manually updating domain-specific resources pose challenges to the reliability of these systems. To address this, we introduce Adaptive Medical Graph-RAG (AMG-RAG), a comprehensive framework that automates the construction and continuous updating of medical knowledge graphs, integrates reasoning, and retrieves current external evidence, such as PubMed and WikiSearch. By dynamically linking new findings and complex medical concepts, AMG-RAG not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability in medical queries.
  Evaluations on the MEDQA and MEDMCQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG-RAG, achieving an F1 score of 74.1 percent on MEDQA and an accuracy of 66.34 percent on MEDMCQA, outperforming both comparable models and those 10 to 100 times larger. Notably, these improvements are achieved without increasing computational overhead, highlighting the critical role of automated knowledge graph generation and external evidence retrieval in delivering up-to-date, trustworthy medical insights.</description>

      <title>Approximate Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for On-Demand Urban Mobility Problem on a Large Map (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01534v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the autonomous multiagent taxi routing problem for a large urban environment where the location and number of future ride requests are unknown a-priori, but can be estimated by an empirical distribution. Recent theory has shown that a rollout algorithm with a stable base policy produces a near-optimal stable policy. In the routing setting, a policy is stable if its execution keeps the number of outstanding requests uniformly bounded over time. Although, rollout-based approaches are well-suited for learning cooperative multiagent policies with considerations for future demand, applying such methods to a large urban environment can be computationally expensive due to the large number of taxis required for stability. In this paper, we aim to address the computational bottleneck of multiagent rollout by proposing an approximate multiagent rollout-based two phase algorithm that reduces computational costs, while still achieving a stable near-optimal policy. Our approach partitions the graph into sectors based on the predicted demand and the maximum number of taxis that can run sequentially given the user's computational resources. The algorithm then applies instantaneous assignment (IA) for re-balancing taxis across sectors and a sector-wide multiagent rollout algorithm that is executed in parallel for each sector. We provide two main theoretical results: 1) characterize the number of taxis $m$ that is sufficient for IA to be stable; 2) derive a necessary condition on $m$ to maintain stability for IA as time goes to infinity. Our numerical results show that our approach achieves stability for an $m$ that satisfies the theoretical conditions. We also empirically demonstrate that our proposed two phase algorithm has equivalent performance to the one-at-a-time rollout over the entire map, but with significantly lower runtimes.</description>

      <title>Incentive-based Platoon Formation: Optimizing the Personal Benefit for Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platooning or cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been investigated for decades, but debate about its lasting impact is still ongoing. Even though platooning benefits and platoon formation are rather well understood for trucks, this is less clear for passenger cars, which have a higher heterogeneity in trips and drivers' preferences. Most importantly, it remains unclear how to form platoons of passenger cars in order to optimize the personal benefit for the individual driver. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel platoon formation algorithm that optimizes the personal benefit for drivers of individual passenger cars. For computing vehicle-to-platoon assignments, the algorithm utilizes a new metric that we propose to evaluate the personal benefits of various driving systems, including platooning. By combining fuel and travel time costs into a single monetary value, drivers can estimate overall trip costs according to a personal monetary value for time spent. This provides an intuitive way for drivers to understand and compare the benefits of driving systems like human driving, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and, of course, platooning. Unlike previous similarity-based methods, our proposed algorithm forms platoons only when beneficial for the driver, rather than for the sake of platooning only. Results of a large-scale simulation study demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms normal ACC as well as previous similarity-based platooning approaches by balancing fuel savings and travel time, independent of traffic and drivers' time cost.</description>

      <title>Learning Flexible Heterogeneous Coordination with Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative heterogeneous multi-agent tasks require agents to effectively coordinate their behaviors while accounting for their relative capabilities. Learning-based solutions to this challenge span between two extremes: i) shared-parameter methods, which encode diverse behaviors within a single architecture by assigning an ID to each agent, and are sample-efficient but result in limited behavioral diversity; ii) independent methods, which learn a separate policy for each agent, and show greater behavioral diversity but lack sample-efficiency. Prior work has also explored selective parameter-sharing, allowing for a compromise between diversity and efficiency. None of these approaches, however, effectively generalize to unseen agents or teams. We present Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a novel architecture for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination that generates sufficient diversity while maintaining sample-efficiency via soft parameter-sharing hypernetworks. Intuitively, CASH allows the team to learn common strategies using a shared encoder, which are then adapted according to the team's individual and collective capabilities with a hypernetwork, allowing for zero-shot generalization to unseen teams and agents. We present experiments across two heterogeneous coordination tasks and three standard learning paradigms (imitation learning, on- and off-policy reinforcement learning). CASH is able to outperform baseline architectures in success rate and sample efficiency when evaluated on unseen teams and agents despite using less than half of the learnable parameters.</description>

      <title>Sable: a Performant, Efficient and Scalable Sequence Model for MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards solving larger and more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important that algorithms exhibit the key properties of (1) strong performance, (2) memory efficiency and (3) scalability. In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory efficient and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks (Sun et al., 2023) to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</description>
