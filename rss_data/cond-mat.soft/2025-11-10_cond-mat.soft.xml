      <title>AI-Driven Design of poly(ethylene terephthalate)-replacement copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a widely used thermoplastic in packaging, textiles, and engineering applications, is valued for its strength, clarity, and chemical resistance. Increasing environmental impact concerns and regulatory pressures drive the search for alternatives with comparable or superior performance. We present an AI-driven polymer design pipeline employing virtual forward synthesis (VFS) to generate PET-replacement copolymers. Inspired by the esterification route of PET synthesis, we systematically combined a down-selected set of Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)-listed monomers to create 12,100 PET-like polymers. Machine learning models predicted glass transition temperature (Tg), band gap, and tendency to crystallize, for all designs. Multi-objective screening identified 1,108 candidates predicted to match or exceed PET in $T_{\rm g}$ and band gap, including the ``rediscovery'' of other known commercial PET-alternate polymers (e.g., PETG, Tritan, Ecozen) that provide retrospective validation of our design pipeline, demonstrating a capability to rapidly design experimentally feasible polymers at a scale. Furthermore, selected, entirely new (previously unknown) candidates designed here have been synthesized and characterized, providing a definitive validation of the design framework.</description>

      <title>Influence of carbon nanocone structure on ultra-efficient water flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, the water flow in carbon nanocones is studied using the TIP4P/2005 rigid water model. The results demonstrate a nonuniform dependence of the flow on the cone apex angle and the diameter of the opening where the flow is established, leading to a significant increase in the flow in some cases. The effects of cone diameter and pressure gradient are investigated to explain flow behavior with different system structures. We observed that some cones can optimize the water flow precisely. Nanocones with a larger opening facilitate the sliding of water, significantly increasing the flow, thus being promising membranes for technological use in water impurity separation processes. Nanocones with narrower opening angles limited water mobility due to excessive confinement. This phenomenon is linked to the ability of water to form a larger hydrogen-bond network in typical systems with diameters of this size, obtaining a single-layer water structure. Nanocones act as selective nanofilters capable of allowing water molecules to pass through while blocking salts and impurities. The conical shape of their structures creates a directed flow that improves separation efficiency. Membranes based on carbon nanocones are becoming promising for clean, smart, and efficient technologies. The combination of transport speed, selectivity, and structural control put them ahead of other nanostructures for various purposes.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted design of chemically recyclable polymers for food packaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer packaging plays a crucial role in food preservation but poses major challenges in recycling and environmental persistence. To address the need for sustainable, high-performance alternatives, we employed a polymer informatics workflow to identify single- and multi-layer drop-in replacements for polymer-based packaging materials. Machine learning (ML) models, trained on carefully curated polymer datasets, predicted eight key properties across a library of approximately 7.4 million ring-opening polymerization (ROP) polymers generated by virtual forward synthesis (VFS). Candidates were prioritized by the enthalpy of polymerization, a critical metric for chemical recyclability. This screening yielded thousands of promising candidates, demonstrating the feasibility of replacing diverse packaging architectures. We then experimentally validated poly(p-dioxanone) (poly-PDO), an existing ROP polymer whose barrier performance had not been previously reported. Validation showed that poly-PDO exhibits strong water barrier performance, mechanical and thermal properties consistent with predictions, and excellent chemical recyclability (95% monomer recovery), thereby meeting the design targets and underscoring its potential for sustainable packaging. These findings highlight the power of informatics-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of sustainable polymers by uncovering opportunities in both existing and novel chemistries.</description>

      <title>Microscopic model for a granular solid-liquid-like phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forced granular matter in confined geometries presents phase transitions and coexistence. Depending on the system and forcing parameters, liquid-vapor and liquid-solid co-existing states are possible. For the solid-liquid coexistence that is observed in quasi-two-dimensional vibrated systems, both first- and second-order transitions have been reported. Experiments show that particles in the solid cluster move collectively, synchronized with the cell's vibration, in a similar way to the collect-and-collide regime observed in granular dampers. Here, we present a model that proposes a microscopic origin of this granular phase transition and co-existence. Imposing synchronicity, we model the solid cluster as an effective particle of zero restitution coefficient. In addition, we use the mechanical equilibrium between the two phases, with an equation of state validated for hard spheres relating the horizontal velocities in each phase. Balancing energy input and dissipation per unit time we obtain a global power equation, which relates the characteristic vertical and horizontal velocities to the microscopic relevant parameters (geometric and dissipation coefficients) as well as to the vibration amplitude and solid cluster's size. The predictions of the model compare quite well with our experimental results and with the experimental and dynamic simulation results reported elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Behavior of Ultra-Low-Crosslinked Microgels in Crowded Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low-crosslinked (ULC) microgels are among the softest colloidal particles nowadays routinely synthesized experimentally. Despite a growing literature of experimental results, their microscopic behavior under crowded conditions is yet to be revealed. To this aim, we resort to realistic monomer-resolved computer simulations to investigate their structural, mechanical, and dynamical properties across a wide range of packing fractions. Using particle-resolved analyses, we unveil the role of outer chains in the ULCs, which manifest in peculiar behaviors, utterly different from those of regularly crosslinked microgels. In particular, we report the absence of faceting and the dominance of interpenetration between microgels at high densities. Furthermore, we observe no signs of local ordering in the radial distribution functions, nor the structural reentrance characteristic of Hertzian-like particles. This is accompanied by the lack of a dynamical arrest transition, even well above random close packing. Altogether, our results establish ULCs as a distinct class of soft colloids in which polymeric degrees of freedom are highly predominant over colloidal ones, providing for the first time a robust, microscopic framework to interpret their unusual behavior.</description>

      <title>Phase separation with non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation in complex systems is a ubiquitous phenomenon. While simple theories predict coarsening until only macroscopically large phases remain, concrete models often exhibit patterns with finite length scales. To unify such models, we here propose a general field-theoretic model that combines phase separation with non-local interactions. Our analysis reveals that long-range interactions generally suppress coarsening, whereas systems with non-local short-range interactions additionally exhibit a continuous phase transition to patterned phases. Only the latter system allows for the coexistence of homogeneous and patterned phases, which we explain by mapping to the conserved Swift-Hohenberg model. Taken together, our generic model reveals an underlying framework that describes similar phenomena observed in many complex phase-separating systems.</description>

      <title>A flexible implementation of strong segregation theory for two dimensional ABC star terpolymer morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel computational implementation of strong segregation theory, developed specifically for calculations of phase separated ABC star terpolymers. The method allows calculation of free energies of common two-dimensional morphologies for these polymers and the efficient construction of phase diagrams. The branch points of the ABC star terpolymers are localized in core regions, modeled as cylinders in three dimensions, and our framework is applicable to morphologies with single and multiple core types. Our central idea is that all the structures we wish to model can be assembled from a flexible base motif, which we call Strongly Segregated Polygons. This method is useful for exploring a wide range of complex morphologies, using a range of compositions and interaction strengths. We focus on 2D morphologies of ABC star terpolymers, but our method could be extended into three dimensions and to other molecular architectures, and in principle to large, irregular quasiperiodic two-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in active epithelia emerge from an interplay of mechano-chemical feedback and crowding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy dynamics in active biological cells remain a subject of debate, as cellular activity rarely slows enough for true glassy features to emerge. In this study, we address this paradox of glassy dynamics in epithelial cells by integrating experimental observations with an active vertex model. We demonstrate that while crowding is essential, it is not sufficient for glassy dynamics to emerge. A mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), mediated by cell shape changes through the contractile actomyosin network, is also required to drive glass transition in dense epithelial tissues, as revealed via a crosstalk between actin-based cell clustering and dynamic heterogeneity in the experiments. Incorporating the MCFL into the vertex model reveals that glassy dynamics can emerge even at high cellular activity if the strength of the MCFL remains high. We show that the MCFL can counteract cell division-induced fluidisation and enable glassy dynamics to emerge through active cell-to-cell communication. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the existence of novel collective mechanochemical oscillations that arise from the crosstalk of two MCFLs. Together, we demonstrate that an interplay between crowding and active mechanochemical feedback enables the emergence of glass-like traits and collective biochemical oscillations in epithelial tissues with active cell-cell contacts.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonequilibrium distribution of large ions in charged small nanopores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to a remarkable discovery [2-4]: with a locally nonchaotic energy barrier, a macroscopic system may produce useful work in a cycle by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The mechanism is rooted in the intrinsic nonequilibrium steady state associated with local nonchaoticity. In the current investigation, we experimentally validate this concept, with the weak gravitational force in the "toy model" being changed to the strong Coulomb force. The tests are performed on a set of nanoporous carbon electrodes immersed in aqueous cesium pivalate solutions. The key characteristic is that the effective nanopore size is only slightly larger than the effective ion size, less than twice the ion size. At first glance, the supercapacitive cells exhibit "normal" charge curves. However, the steady-state distribution of the large ions in the charged small nanopores inherently differs from thermodynamic equilibrium, because of the confinement effect of the nanopore walls. The measured potential difference is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the upper limit calculated from the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Although counterintuitive, such a phenomenon is consistent with the molecular dynamics simulations in open literature.</description>

      <title>Noise-driven odd elastic waves in living chiral active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral active matter is predicted to exhibit odd elasticity, with nontraditional elastic response arising from a combination of chirality, being out of equilibrium, and the presence of nonreciprocal interactions. One of the resulting phenomena is the possible occurrence of odd elastic waves in overdamped systems, although its experimental realization still remains elusive. Here we show that in overdamped active systems, noise is required to generate persistent elastic waves. In the chiral crystalline phase of active matter, such as that found recently in populations of swimming starfish embryos, the noise arises from the self-driving of active particles and their mutual collisions, a key factor that has been missing in previous studies. We identify the criterion for the occurrence of noise-driven odd elastic waves and construct the corresponding phase diagram, which is also applicable to general chiral active crystals. Our results can be used to predict the experimental conditions for achieving a transition to self-sustained elastic waves in overdamped active systems.</description>

      <title>Topological defects lead to energy transfer in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active nematics are fluids in which the components have nematic symmetry and are driven out of equilibrium due to the microscopic generation of an active stress. When the active stress is high, it drives flows in the nematic and can lead to the proliferation of topological defects, a state we refer to as defect chaos. Using numerical simulations of active nematics, we observe energy transfer between length scales during defect chaos. We demonstrate that this energy transfer is driven by the exchange between variations in the orientation and degree of order in the nematic that predominantly occur during defect creation and annihilation. We then show that the primary features of energy transfer during defect chaos scale with the active length scale. Finally, we identify a second regime that features few defects, but rather bend walls. Similar to topological defects, these bend walls co-localize variations in the orientation with variations in the scalar order parameter leading to energy transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical properties of active suspensions is crucial for their potential applications in materials engineering. Among the various phenomena in active matter that have no analogue in equilibrium systems, motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in active colloidal suspensions is one of the most extensively studied. However, the mechanical properties of this fundamental active state of matter remain poorly understood. This study investigates the rheology of a suspension of active colloidal particles under constant and oscillatory shear. Systems consisting of pseudo-hard active Brownian particles exhibiting co-existence of dense and dilute phases behave as a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid at low and high frequencies, displaying exclusively shear thinning across a wide range of densities and activities. Remarkably, the cross-over point between the storage and loss moduli is non-monotonic, rising with activity before the MIPS transition but falling with activity after the transition, revealing the subtleties of how active forces and intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases affect the mechanical properties of these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between charged colloidal particles are profoundly influenced by charge regulation and charge renormalization, rendering the effective potential highly sensitive to local particle density. In this work, we investigate how a dynamically evolving, density-dependent Yukawa interaction affects the stability of out-of-equilibrium colloidal structures. Motivated by a series of experiments where unexpectedly long-lived colloidal crystals have suggested the presence of like-charged attractions, we systematically explore the role of charge regulation and charge renormalization. Using Poisson-Boltzmann cell theory, we compute the effective colloidal charge and screening length as a function of packing fraction. These results are subsequently incorporated into Brownian dynamics simulations that dynamically resolve the evolving colloid charge as a function of time and local density. In the case of slow relaxation dynamics, our results show that incorporating these charging effects significantly prolongs the lifetimes of out-of-equilibrium colloidal crystals, providing an explanation for the experimental observation of long-lived crystals. These findings demonstrate that the interplay of surface charge dynamics and colloidal interactions can give rise to complex and rich nonequilibrium behavior in charged colloidal suspensions, opening new pathways for tuning colloidal stability through electrostatic feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Flat quasicrystalline tilings in terms of density wave approach</title>

Abstract: Classical Landau theory considers structural phase transitions and crystallization as a condensation of several critical density waves whose wave vectors are symmetrically equivalent. Analyzing the simplest nonequilibrium Landau potentials obtained for decagonal and dodecagonal cases, we derive constraints on the phases of the critical waves and deduce two pairs of flat tilings that are the simplest from the viewpoint of our theory. Each pair corresponds to the same irreducible interference pattern: the vertices of the first and second tilings are located at its minima and maxima, respectively. The first decagonal pair consists of the Penrose P1 tiling and the Tie and Navette one. The second pair is represented by dodecagonal tiling of squares, triangles, and shields, and previously unidentified one formed by regular dodecagons and identical deformed pentagons. Surprisingly, the proposed method for finding extrema of interference patterns provides a straightforward way to generate the Penrose tiling P3 and its more complicated analogues with 2n-fold symmetries. Within Landau theory, we discuss the assembly of the square-triangular tiling and its relationship with the dodecagonal tiling that includes shields. Then we develop a nonequilibrium assembly approach that is based on Landau theory and allows us to produce tilings with random phason strain characteristic of quasicrystals. Interestingly, the approach can generate tilings without or with a minimum number of defective tiles. Examples of real systems rationalized within Landau theory are considered as well. Finally, the derivation of other tilings arising from the reducible interference patterns is discussed, and the relative complexity of non-phenomenological interactions required for the assembly of decagonal and dodecagonal structures is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Detecting active L\'evy particles using differential dynamic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting L\'evy flights of cells has been a challenging problem in experiments. The challenge lies in accessing data in spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, which is necessary for reliably extracting a power-law scaling. Differential dynamic microscopy has been shown to be a powerful method that allows one to acquire statistics of cell motion across scales, which is a potentially versatile method for detecting L\'evy walks in biological systems. In this article, we extend the differential dynamic microscopy method to self-propelled L\'evy particles, whose run-time distribution has a algebraic tail. We validate our protocol using synthetic imaging data and show that a reliable detection of active L\'evy particles requires accessing length scales of one order of magnitude larger than its persistence length. Applying the protocol to experimental data of E. coli and E. gracilis, we find that E. coli does not exhibit a signature of L\'evy walks, while E. gracilis is better described as active L\'evy particles.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we numerically show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. This claim is further supported by analytical effective-medium theory and by numerical estimates of scattering mean-free paths. Finally, we introduce ``polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Local entropy production rate of run-and-tumble particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local entropy production rate and the local entropy flow in active systems composed of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles in a thermal bath. After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria, cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with numerical simulations.</description>
