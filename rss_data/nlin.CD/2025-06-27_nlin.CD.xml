      <title>Modeling active nematics via the nematic locking principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active nematic systems consist of rod-like internally driven subunits that interact with one another to form large-scale coherent flows. They are important examples of far-from-equilibrium fluids, which exhibit a wealth of nonlinear behavior. This includes active turbulence, in which topological defects braid around one another in a chaotic fashion. One of the most studied examples of active nematics is a dense two-dimensional layer of microtubules, crosslinked by kinesin molecular motors that inject extensile deformations into the fluid. Though numerous studies have modeled microtubule-based active nematics, no consensus has emerged on how to fully capture the features of the experimental system. To better understand the foundations for modeling this system, we propose a fundamental principle we call the nematic locking principle: individual microtubules cannot rotate without all neighboring microtubules also rotating. Physically, this is justified by the high density of the microtubules, their elongated nature, and their corresponding steric interactions. We assert that nematic locking holds throughout the majority of the material but breaks down in the neighborhood of topological defects and other regions of low density. We derive the most general nematic transport equation consistent with this principle and also derive the most general term that violates it. We examine the standard Beris-Edwards approach used to model this system and show that it violates nematic locking throughout the majority of the material. We then propose a modification to the Beris-Edwards model that enforces nematic locking nearly everywhere. This modification shuts off fracturing except in regions where the order parameter is reduced. The resulting simulations show strong nematic locking throughout the bulk of the material, consistent with experimental observation.</description>

      <title>A time-marching quantum algorithm for simulation of the nonlinear Lorenz dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating nonlinear classical dynamics on a quantum computer is an inherently challenging task due to the linear operator formulation of quantum mechanics. In this work, we provide a systematic approach to alleviate this difficulty by developing a quantum algorithm that implements the time evolution of a second order time-discretized version of the Lorenz model. The Lorenz model is a celebrated system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that has been extensively studied in the contexts of climate science, fluid dynamics, and chaos theory. Our algorithm possesses a recursive structure and requires only a linear number of copies of the initial state with respect to the number of integration time-steps. This provides a significant improvement over previous approaches, while preserving the characteristic quantum speed-up in terms of the dimensionality of the underlying differential equations system, that similar time-marching quantum algorithms have previously demonstrated. Notably, by classically implementing the proposed algorithm, we showcase that it accurately captures the structural characteristics of the Lorenz system, reproducing both regular attractors--limit cycles--and the chaotic attractor within the chosen parameter regime.</description>
