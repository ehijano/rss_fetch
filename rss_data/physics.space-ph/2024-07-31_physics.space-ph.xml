      <title>The Interplay Between Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alongside magnetic reconnection, turbulence is another fundamental nonlinear plasma phenomenon that plays a key role in energy transport and conversion in space and astrophysical plasmas. From a numerical, theoretical, and observational point of view there is a long history of exploring the interplay between these two phenomena in space plasma environments; however, recent high-resolution, multi-spacecraft observations have ushered in a new era of understanding this complex topic. The interplay between reconnection and turbulence is both complex and multifaceted, and can be viewed through a number of different interrelated lenses - including turbulence acting to generate current sheets that undergo magnetic reconnection (turbulence-driven reconnection), magnetic reconnection driving turbulent dynamics in an environment (reconnection-driven turbulence) or acting as an intermediate step in the excitation of turbulence, and the random diffusive/dispersive nature of magnetic field lines embedded in turbulent fluctuations enabling so-called stochastic reconnection. In this paper, we review the current state of knowledge on these different facets of the interplay between turbulence and reconnection in the context of collisionless plasmas, such as those found in many near-Earth astrophysical environments, from a theoretical, numerical, and observational perspective. Particular focus is given to several key regions in Earth's magnetosphere - Earth's magnetosheath, magnetotail, and Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices on the magnetopause flanks - where NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale mission has been providing new insights on the topic.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Energy Conversion Associated with Kinetic Microinstabilities in Earth's Magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma in the terrestrial magnetosheath is characterised by very weak particle-particle collisions, so kinetic microinstabilities are thought to be responsible for regulating the thermodynamics of the plasma. By exciting electromagnetic waves, these instabilities redistribute free energy in velocity space, moulding the velocity distribution function (VDF) into a lower energy state. In the high-beta magnetosheath, relatively small perturbations to the VDF can easily excite instabilities compared to in the low-beta inner heliosphere. Since magnetic fields cannot do work on the particles, electric fields mediate energy exchange between the electromagnetic field and the bulk fluid properties of the plasma. We investigate signatures of non-ideal energy conversion associated with turbulent fluctuations in the context of electron and ion temperature anisotropy-beta instabilities, utilising over 24 hours of data spread over 163 distinct intervals of in situ magnetosheath observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS). We find that average energy conversion into fluid flow is enhanced along instability boundaries, suggesting that turbulence is playing a role in how free energy is redistributed in the plasma. The work enables a quantification of the energetics which are associated with the role of kinetic microinstabilities in regulating collisionless plasma thermodynamics. This work provides insight into the open question of how specific plasma processes couple into the turbulent dynamics and ultimately lead to energy dissipation and particle energisation in collisionless plasmas.</description>

      <title>Constraints on photon mass and dark photon from the Jovian magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jovian magnetic field, being the strongest and largest planetary one in the solar system, could offer us new insights into possible microscopic scale new physics, such as a non-zero mass of the Standard Model (SM) photon or a light dark photon kinetically mixing with the SM photon. We employ the immense data set from the latest Juno mission, which provides us unprecedented information about the magnetic field of the gas giant, together with a more rigorous statistical approach compared to the literature, to set strong constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing parameter, as well as the SM photon mass. The constraint on the dark photon parameters is independent of whether dark photon is (part of) dark matter or not, and serves as the most stringent one in a certain regime of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Three-dimensional Simulation of Surface Charging on Rotating Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface charging phenomenon of asteroids, mainly resulting from solar wind plasma and solar radiation, has been studied extensively. However, the influence of asteroid's rotation on surface charging has yet to be fully understood. Here neural network is established to replace numerical integration, improving the efficiency of dynamic three-dimensional simulation. We implement simulation of rotating asteroids and surrounding plasma environment under different conditions, including quiet solar wind and solar storms, various minerals on asteroid's surface also be considered. For asteroids with rotation periods comparable to orbital period, effect of orbital motion and obliquity also be studied. Results show that under typical solar wind, the maximum and minimum potential of asteroids will gradually decrease with their increasing periods, especially when solar wind is obliquely incident. For asteroid has period longer than one week, this decreasing trend will become extremely slow. During solar storm passing, solar wind plasma changes sharply, the susceptibility of asteroid's surface potential to rotation is greatly pronounced. Minerals on surface also count, plagioclase is the most sensitive mineral among those we explored, while ilmenite seems indifferent to changes in rotation periods. Understanding the surface charging of asteroid under various rotation periods or angles, is crucial for further research into solar wind plasma and asteroid's surface dust motion, providing a reference for safe landing exploration of asteroids.</description>

      <title>Evolution of reconnection flux during eruption of magnetic flux ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are powerful drivers of space weather, with magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) widely regarded as their primary precursors. However, the variation in reconnection flux during the evolution of MFR during CME eruptions remains poorly understood. In this paper, we develop a realistic 3D magneto-hydrodynamic model using which we explore the temporal evolution of reconnection flux during the MFR evolution using both numerical simulations and observational data. Our initial coronal configuration features an isothermal atmosphere and a potential arcade magnetic field beneath which an MFR emerges at the lower boundary. As the MFR rises, we observe significant stretching and compression of the overlying magnetic field beneath it. Magnetic reconnection begins with the gradual formation of a current sheet, eventually culminating with the impulsive expulsion of the flux rope. We analyze the temporal evolution of reconnection fluxes during two successive MFR eruptions while continuously emerging the twisted flux rope through the lower boundary. We also conduct a similar analysis using observational data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for an eruptive event. Comparing our MHD simulation with observational data, we find that reconnection flux play a crucial role in determination of CME speeds. From the onset to the eruption, the reconnection flux shows a strong linear correlation with the velocity. This nearly realistic simulation of a solar eruption provides important insights into the complex dynamics of CME initiation and progression.</description>
