      <title>Ricci-Notation Tensor Framework for Model-based Approaches to Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04018v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-based approaches to imaging, like specialized image enhancements in astronomy, facilitate explanations of relationships between observed inputs and computed outputs. These models may be expressed with extended matrix-vector (EMV) algebra, especially when they involve only scalars, vectors, and matrices, and with n-mode or index notations, when they involve multidimensional arrays, also called numeric tensors or, simply, tensors. While this paper features an example, inspired by exoplanet imaging, that employs tensors to reveal (inverse) 2D fast Fourier transforms in an image enhancement model, the work is actually about the tensor algebra and software, or tensor frameworks, available for model-based imaging. The paper proposes a Ricci-notation tensor (RT) framework, comprising a dual-variant index notation, with Einstein summation convention, and codesigned object-oriented software, called the RTToolbox for MATLAB. Extensions to Ricci notation offer novel representations for entrywise, pagewise, and broadcasting operations popular in EMV frameworks for imaging. Complementing the EMV algebra computable with MATLAB, the RTToolbox demonstrates programmatic and computational efficiency via careful design of numeric tensor and dual-variant index classes. Compared to its closest competitor, also a numeric tensor framework that uses index notation, the RT framework enables superior ways to model imaging problems and, thereby, to develop solutions.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Nonlinear Mixed-Integer Location Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For three decades, carrier-phase observations have been used to obtain the most accurate location estimates using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). These estimates are computed by minimizing a nonlinear mixed-integer least-squares problem. Existing algorithms linearize the problem, orthogonally project it to eliminate real variables, and then solve the integer least-square problem. There is now considerable interest in developing similar localization techniques for terrestrial and indoor settings. We show that algorithms that linearize first fail in these settings and we propose several algorithms for computing the estimates. Some of our algorithms are elimination algorithms that start by eliminating the non-linear terms in the constraints; others construct a geometric arrangement that allows us to efficiently enumerate integer solutions (in polynomial time). We focus on simplified localization problems in which the measurements are range (distance) measurements and carrier phase range measurements, with no nuisance parameters. The simplified problem allows us to focus on the core question of untangling the nonlinearity and the integer nature of some parameters. We show using simulations that the new algorithms are effective at close ranges at which the linearize-first approach fails.</description>

      <title>Rapid Variable Resolution Particle Initialization for Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of meshless methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is highly dependent on the quality of the particle distribution. Existing particle initialization techniques often struggle to simultaneously achieve adaptive resolution, handle intricate boundaries, and efficiently generate well-packed distributions inside and outside a boundary. This work presents a fast and robust particle initialization method that achieves these goals using standard SPH building blocks. Our approach enables simultaneous initialization of fluid and solid regions, supports arbitrary geometries, and achieves high-quality, quasi-uniform particle arrangements without complex procedures like surface bonding. Extensive results in both 2D and 3D demonstrate that the obtained particle distributions exhibit good boundary conformity, low spatial disorder, and minimal density variation, all with significantly reduced computational cost compared to existing approaches. This work paves the way for automated particle initialization to accurately model flow in and around bodies with meshless methods, particularly with SPH.</description>

      <title>Fast, Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Ray Tracing for Multiple Diffraction and Reflection Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated optimization method for ray path tracing in environments containing planar reflectors and straight diffraction edges. Based on Fermat's principle, our approach reformulates the path-finding problem as the minimization of total path length, enabling efficient parallel execution on modern GPU architectures. Unlike existing methods that require separate algorithms for reflections and diffractions, our unified formulation maintains consistent problem dimensions across all interaction sequences, making it particularly suitable for vectorized computation. Through implicit differentiation, we achieve efficient gradient computation without differentiating through solver iterations, significantly outperforming traditional automatic differentiation approaches. Numerical simulations demonstrate convergence rates comparable to specialized Newton methods while providing superior scalability for large-scale applications. The method integrates seamlessly with differentiable programming libraries such as JAX and DrJIT, enabling new possibilities in inverse design and optimization for wireless propagation modeling. The source code is openly available at https://github.com/jeertmans/fpt-jax.</description>

      <title>Improving Directions in Mixed Integer Bilevel Linear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the central role of improving directions in solution methods for mixed integer bilevel linear optimization problems (MIBLPs). Current state-of-the-art methods for solving MIBLPs employ the branch-and-cut framework originally developed for solving mixed integer linear optimization problems. This approach relies on oracles for two kinds of subproblems: those for checking whether a candidate pair of leader's and follower's decisions is bilevel feasible, and those required for generating valid inequalities. Typically, these two types of oracles are managed separately, but in this work, we explore their close connection and propose a solution framework based on solving a single type of subproblem: determining whether there exists a so-called improving feasible direction for the follower's problem. Solution of this subproblem yields information that can be used both to check feasibility and to generate strong valid inequalities. Building on prior works, we expose the foundational role of improving directions in enforcing the follower's optimality condition and extend a previously known hierarchy of optimality-based relaxations to the mixed-integer setting, showing that the associated relaxed feasible regions coincide exactly with the closure associated with intersection cuts derived from improving directions. Numerical results with an implementation using a modified version of the open source solver MibS show that this approach can yield practical improvements.</description>
