      <title>Low temperature expansion for the Euclidean $\Phi^4_2$-measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study asymptotic expansions of the Euclidean $\Phi^4_2$-measure in the low-temperature regime. In particular, this extends the asymptotic expansions of Gaussian function space integrals developed in Schilder (1966) and Ellis and Rosen (1982) to the singular setting, where the field is no longer a function, but just a distribution. As a consequence, we deduce limit theorems, specifically the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the $\Phi^4_2$-measure in the low-temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Invariant sample measures and sample statistical solutions for nonautonomous stochastic lattice Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlinear noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic lattice Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonautonomous nonlinear noise. First, we prove the existence of pullback random attractors in $\ell^2$ for the generated nonautonomous random dynamical system. Then, we construct the time-dependent invariant sample Borel probability measures based on the pullback random attractor. Moreover, we develop a general stochastic Liouville type equation for nonautonomous random dynamical systems and show that the invariant sample measures obtained satisfy the stochastic Liouville type equation. At last, we define a new kind of statistical solution -- sample statistical solution corresponding to the invariant sample measures and show that each family of invariant sample measures is a sample statistical solution.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem and Exponential Correlation Decay for the Coulomb Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Coulomb chain where particles are restricted to one dimension and experience three-dimensional Coulomb interactions with their nearest and next-to-nearest neighbours. The distances between consecutive particles are treated as random variables. It is shown that the correlation between clusters of consecutive variables decay exponentially with the number of variables separating them. This result is then used to prove a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Hoeffding's inequality for continuous-time Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hoeffding's inequality is a fundamental tool widely applied in probability theory, statistics, and machine learning. In this paper, we establish Hoeffding's inequalities specifically tailored for an irreducible and positive recurrent continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) on a countable state space with the invariant probability distribution ${\pi}$ and an $\mathcal{L}^{2}(\pi)$-spectral gap ${\lambda}(Q)$. More precisely, for a function $g:E\to [a,b]$ with a mean $\pi(g)$, and given $t,\varepsilon&gt;0$, we derive the inequality \[ \mathbb{P}_{\pi}\left(\frac{1}{t} \int_{0}^{t} g\left(X_{s}\right)\mathrm{d}s-\pi (g) \geq \varepsilon \right) \leq \exp\left\{-\frac{{\lambda}(Q)t\varepsilon^2}{(b-a)^2} \right\}, \] which can be viewed as a generalization of Hoeffding's inequality for discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) presented in [J. Fan et al., J. Mach. Learn. Res., 22(2022), pp. 6185-6219] to the realm of CTMCs. The key analysis enabling the attainment of this inequality lies in the utilization of the techniques of skeleton chains and augmented truncation approximations. Furthermore, we also discuss Hoeffding's inequality for a jump process on a general state space.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness in law for singular degenerate SDEs with respect to a (sub-)invariant measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show weak existence and uniqueness in law for a general class of stochastic differential equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 1$, with prescribed sub-invariant measure $\widehat{\mu}$. The dispersion and drift coefficients of the stochastic differential equation are allowed to be degenerate and discontinuous, and locally unbounded, respectively. Uniqueness in law is obtained via $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d,\widehat{\mu})$-uniqueness in a subclass of continuous Markov processes, namely right processes that have $\widehat{\mu}$ as sub-invariant measure and have continuous paths for $\widehat{\mu}$-almost every starting point. Weak existence is obtained for a broader class via the martingale problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal subgraphs in geometric scale-free random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric scale-free random graphs are popular models for networks that exhibit as heavy-tailed degree distributions, small-worldness and high clustering. In these models, vertices have weights that cause the heavy-tailed degrees and are embedded in a metric space so that close-by groups of vertices tend to cluster. The interplay between the vertex weights and positions heavily affects the local structure of the random graph, in particular the occurrence of subgraph patterns, but the dependencies in these structures and weights make them difficult to analyze. In this paper we investigate subgraph counts using a \textit{divide et impera} strategy: first counting the number of subgraphs in specific classes of vertices; then computing which class yields maximum contribution. Interestingly, the scaling behavior of induced and general subgraphs in such geometric heavy-tailed random graphs is closely related to the solution of a mixed-integer linear program which also shows that subgraphs appear predominantly on vertices with some prescribed degrees and inter-distances. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for trees and Hamiltonian subgraphs.</description>

      <title>A Law of large numbers for vector-valued linear statistics of Bergman DPP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a law of large numbers for a certain class of vector-valued linear statistics for the Bergman determinantal point process on the unit disk. Our result seems to be the first LLN for vector-valued linear statistics in the setting of determinantal point processes. As an application, we prove that, for almost all configurations $X$ with respect to with respect to the Bergman determinantal point process, the weighted Poincar\'e series (we denote by $d_{h}(\cdot,\cdot)$ the hyperbolic distance on $\mathbb{D}$) \begin{align*} \sum_{k=0}^\infty\sum_{x\in X\atop k\le d_{h}(z,x)&lt;k+1}e^{-sd_{\mathrm{h}}(z,x)}f(x) \end{align*} cannot be simultaneously convergent for all Bergman functions $f\in A^2(\mathbb{D})$ whenever $1&lt;s&lt;3/2$. This confirms a result announced without proof in Bufetov-Qiu's work.</description>

      <title>Geometric scale-free random graphs on mobile vertices: broadcast and percolation times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of information propagation on mobile geometric scale-free random graphs, where vertices instantaneously pass on information to all other vertices in the same connected component. The graphs we consider are constructed on a Poisson point process of intensity $\lambda&gt;0$, and the vertices move over time as simple Brownian motions on either $\mathbb{R}^d$ or the $d$-dimensional torus of volume $n$, while edges are randomly drawn depending on the locations of the vertices, as well as their a priori assigned marks. This includes mobile versions of the age-dependent random connection model and the soft Boolean model. We show that in the ultrasmall regime of these random graphs, information is broadcast to all vertices on a torus of volume $n$ in poly-logarithmic time and that on $\mathbb{R}^d$, the information will reach the infinite component before time $t$ with stretched exponentially high probability, for any $\lambda&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Score matching for sub-Riemannian bridge sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of conditioned diffusion processes is an essential tool in inference for stochastic processes, data imputation, generative modelling, and geometric statistics. Whilst simulating diffusion bridge processes is already difficult on Euclidean spaces, when considering diffusion processes on Riemannian manifolds the geometry brings in further complications. In even higher generality, advancing from Riemannian to sub-Riemannian geometries introduces hypoellipticity, and the possibility of finding appropriate explicit approximations for the score of the diffusion process is removed. We handle these challenges and construct a method for bridge simulation on sub-Riemannian manifolds by demonstrating how recent progress in machine learning can be modified to allow for training of score approximators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Since gradients dependent on the horizontal distribution, we generalise the usual notion of denoising loss to work with non-holonomic frames using a stochastic Taylor expansion, and we demonstrate the resulting scheme both explicitly on the Heisenberg group and more generally using adapted coordinates. We perform numerical experiments exemplifying samples from the bridge process on the Heisenberg group and the concentration of this process for small time.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom Permutations from Random Reversible Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pseudorandomness properties of permutations on $\{0,1\}^n$ computed by random circuits made from reversible $3$-bit gates (permutations on $\{0,1\}^3$). Our main result is that a random circuit of depth $n \cdot \tilde{O}(k^2)$, with each layer consisting of $\approx n/3$ random gates in a fixed nearest-neighbor architecture, yields almost $k$-wise independent permutations. The main technical component is showing that the Markov chain on $k$-tuples of $n$-bit strings induced by a single random $3$-bit nearest-neighbor gate has spectral gap at least $1/n \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$. This improves on the original work of Gowers [Gowers96], who showed a gap of $1/\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ for one random gate (with non-neighboring inputs); and, on subsequent work [HMMR05,BH08] improving the gap to $\Omega(1/n^2k)$ in the same setting.
  From the perspective of cryptography, our result can be seen as a particularly simple/practical block cipher construction that gives provable statistical security against attackers with access to $k$~input-output pairs within few rounds. We also show that the Luby--Rackoff construction of pseudorandom permutations from pseudorandom functions can be implemented with reversible circuits. From this, we make progress on the complexity of the Minimum Reversible Circuit Size Problem (MRCSP), showing that block ciphers of fixed polynomial size are computationally secure against arbitrary polynomial-time adversaries, assuming the existence of one-way functions (OWFs).</description>

      <title>Eigenvector distributions and optimal shrinkage estimators for large covariance and precision matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on investigating Stein's invariant shrinkage estimators for large sample covariance matrices and precision matrices in high-dimensional settings. We consider models that have nearly arbitrary population covariance matrices, including those with potential spikes. By imposing mild technical assumptions, we establish the asymptotic limits of the shrinkers for a wide range of loss functions. A key contribution of this work, enabling the derivation of the limits of the shrinkers, is a novel result concerning the asymptotic distributions of the non-spiked eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrices, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $\phi$ be strictly plurisubharmonic function on $\Omega$. For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, we consider determinantal point process $\Lambda_k$ with kernel $K_{k\phi}$, where $K_{k\phi}$ is the reproducing kernel of weighted Bergman space $H(k\phi)$ with weight $e^{-k\phi}$. We show that the limit of scaled cumulant generating funcion for $\Lambda_k$ converges as $k\rightarrow\infty$ to a certain limit, which can be explicitly expressed in terms of $\phi$ and a test function $u$. Note that we need to restrict the shape of the test functions $u$ to be $\phi$-admissible.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Steps of CyclePopping in Weakly Inconsistent U(1)-Connection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A U(1)-connection graph $G$ is a graph in which each oriented edge is endowed with a unit complex number, the latter being conjugated under orientation flip. We consider cycle-rooted spanning forests (CRSFs), a particular kind of spanning subgraphs of $G$ that have recently found computational applications as randomized spectral sparsifiers. In this context, CRSFs are drawn from a determinantal measure. Under a condition on the connection, Kassel and Kenyon gave an elegant algorithm, named CyclePopping, to sample from this distribution. The algorithm is an extension of the celebrated algorithm of Wilson that uses a loop-erased random walk to sample uniform spanning trees. In this paper, we give an alternative, elementary proof of correctness of CyclePopping for CRSF sampling; we fill the gaps of a proof sketch by Kassel, who was himself inspired by Marchal's proof of the correctness of Wilson's original algorithm. One benefit of the full proof \`a la Marchal is that we obtain a concise expression for the law of the number of steps to complete the sampling procedure, shedding light on practical situations where the algorithm is expected to run fast. Furthermore, we show how to extend the proof to more general distributions over CRSFs, which are not determinantal. The correctness of CyclePopping is known even in the non-determinantal case from the work of Kassel and Kenyon, so our merit is only to provide an alternate proof. One interest of this alternate proof is again to provide the distribution of the time complexity of the algorithm, in terms of a Poisson point process on the graph loops, or equivalently as a Poisson process on pyramids of cycles, a combinatorial notion introduced by Viennot. Finally, we strive to make the connections to loop measures and combinatorial structures as explicit as possible, to provide a reference for future extensions of the algorithm and its analysis.</description>

      <title>Superiority of stochastic symplectic methods via the law of iterated logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superiority of stochastic symplectic methods over non-symplectic counterparts has been verified by plenty of numerical experiments, especially in capturing the asymptotic behaviour of the underlying solution process. How can one theoretically explain this superiority? This paper gives an answer to this problem from the perspective of the law of iterated logarithm, taking the linear stochastic Hamiltonian system in Hilbert space as a test model. The main contribution is twofold. First, by fully utilizing the time-change theorem for martingales and the Borell--TIS inequality, we prove that the upper limit of the exact solution with a specific scaling function almost surely equals some non-zero constant, thus confirming the validity of the law of iterated logarithm. Second, we prove that stochastic symplectic fully discrete methods asymptotically preserve the law of iterated logarithm, but non-symplectic ones do not. This reveals the good ability of stochastic symplectic methods in characterizing the almost sure asymptotic growth of the utmost fluctuation of the underlying solution process. Applications of our results to the linear stochastic oscillator and the linear stochastic Schrodinger equation are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the 1-dimensional cubic Szeg\H{o} equation with data distributed according to the Gaussian measure with inverse covariance operator $(1-\partial_x^2)^\frac s2$, where $s&gt;\frac12$. We show that, for $s&gt;1$, this measure is quasi-invariant under the flow of the equation, while for $s&lt;1$, $s\neq \frac34$, the transported measure and the initial Gaussian measure are mutually singular for almost every time. This is the first observation of a transition from quasi-invariance to singularity in the context of the transport of Gaussian measures under the flow of Hamiltonian PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic zero forcing is a graph coloring process in which blue vertices "infect" (color blue) white vertices with a probability proportional to the number of neighboring blue vertices. We introduce reversion probabilistic zero forcing (RPZF), which shares the same infection dynamics but also allows for blue vertices to revert to being white in each round. We establish a tool which, given a graph's RPZF Markov transition matrix, calculates the probability that the graph turns all white or all blue as well as the time at which this is expected to occur. For specific graph families we produce a threshold number of blue vertices for the graph to become entirely blue in the next round with high probability.</description>

      <title>Cooperation, Correlation and Competition in Ergodic $N$-player Games and Mean-field Games of Singular Controls: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider ergodic symmetric $N$-player and mean-field games of singular control in both cooperative and competitive settings. The state process dynamics of a representative player follow geometric Brownian motion, controlled additively through a nondecreasing process. Agents aim to maximize a long-time average reward functional with instantaneous profit of power type. The game shows strategic complementarities, in that the marginal profit function is increasing with respect to the dynamic average of the states of the other players, when $N&lt;\infty$, or with respect to the stationary mean of the players' distribution, in the mean-field case. In the mean-field formulation, we explicitly construct the solution to the mean-field control problem associated with central planner optimization, as well as Nash and coarse correlated equilibria (with singular and regular recommendations). Among our findings, we show that coarse correlated equilibria may exist even when Nash equilibria do not. Additionally, we show that a coarse correlated equilibrium with a regular (absolutely continuous) recommendation can outperform a Nash equilibrium where the equilibrium policy is of reflecting type (thus singularly continuous). Furthermore, we prove that the constructed mean-field control and mean-field equilibria can approximate the cooperative and competitive equilibria, respectively, in the corresponding game with $N$ players when $N$ is sufficiently large. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to characterize coarse correlated equilibria, construct the explicit solution to an ergodic mean-field control problem, and provide approximation results for the related $N$-player game in the context of singular control games.</description>

      <title>A Nordhaus--Gaddum problem for spectral gap of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, with complement $\overline{G}$. The spectral gap of the transition probability matrix of a random walk on $G$ is used to estimate how fast the random walk becomes stationary. We prove that the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $\Omega(1/n)$. Moreover, if all degrees are $\Omega(n)$ and $n-\Omega(n)$, then the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $\Theta(1)$. We also show that if the maximum degree is $n-O(1)$ or if $G$ is a join of two graphs, then the spectral gap of $G$ is $\Omega(1/n)$. Finally, we provide a family of graphs such that the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $O(1/n^{3/4})$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of martingales via enriched dagger categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a categorical proof of convergence for martingales and backward martingales in mean, using enriched category theory. The enrichment we use is in topological spaces, with their canonical closed monoidal structure, which encodes a version of pointwise convergence.
  We work in a topologically enriched dagger category of probability spaces and Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. In this category we can describe conditional expectations exactly as dagger-split idempotent morphisms, and filtrations can be encoded as directed nets of split idempotents, with their canonical partial order structure. As we show, every increasing (or decreasing) net of idempotents tends topologically to its supremum (or infimum).
  Random variables on a probability space form contravariant functors into categories of Hilbert and Banach spaces, which we can enrich topologically using the L^p norms. Martingales and backward martingales can be defined in terms of these functors. Since enriched functors preserve convergence of nets, we obtain convergence in the L^p norms. The convergence result for backward martingales indexed by an arbitrary net, in particular, seems to be new.
  By changing the functor, one can describe more general notions of conditional expectations and martingales, and if the functor is enriched, one automatically obtains a convergence result. For instance, one can recover the Bochner-based notion of vector-valued conditional expectation, and the convergence of martingales with values in an arbitrary Banach space.
  This work seems to be the first application of topologically enriched categories to analysis and probability in the literature. We hope that this enrichment, so often overlooked in the past, will be used in the future to obtain further convergence results categorically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive estimates for the Hessian of the logarithm (log-Hessian) for solutions to the heat equation. For initial data in the form of log-Lipschitz perturbation of strongly log-concave measures, the log-Hessian admits an explicit, uniform (in space) lower bound. This yields a new estimate for the Lipschitz constant of a transport map pushing forward the standard Gaussian to a measure in this class. Further connections are discussed with score-based diffusion models and improved Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Finally, we show that assuming only fast decay of the tails of the initial datum does not suffice to guarantee uniform log-Hessian upper bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fields of effective resistance and optimal transport on graphs are filled with rich connections to combinatorics, geometry, machine learning, and beyond. In this article we put forth a bold claim: that the two fields should be understood as one and the same, up to a choice of $p$. We make this claim precise by introducing the parameterized family of $p$-Beckmann distances for probability measures on graphs and relate them sharply to certain Wasserstein distances. Then, we break open a suite of results including explicit connections to optimal stopping times and random walks on graphs, graph Sobolev spaces, and a Benamou-Brenier type formula for $2$-Beckmann distance. We further explore empirical implications in the world of unsupervised learning for graph data and propose further study of the usage of these metrics where Wasserstein distance may produce computational bottlenecks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider (upward skip-free) discrete-time and discrete-space Markov additive chains (MACs) and develop the theory for the so-called $\tilde{W}$ and $\tilde{Z}$ scale matrices. which are shown to play a vital role in the determination of a number of exit problems and related fluctuation identities. The theory developed in this fully discrete setup follows similar lines of reasoning as the analogous theory for Markov additive processes in continuous-time and is exploited to obtain the probabilistic construction of the scale matrices, identify the form of the generating function and produce a simple recursion relation for $\tilde{W}$, as well as its connection with the so-called occupation mass formula. In addition to the standard one and two-sided exit problems (upwards and downwards), we also derive distributional characteristics for a number of quantities related to the one and two-sided `reflected' processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal stopping problem under random horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a pair $(\mathbb{F},\tau)$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a filtration representing the "public" flow of information which is available to all agents overtime, and $\tau$ is a random time which might not be an $\mathbb{F}$-stopping time. This setting covers the case of credit risk framework where $\tau$ models the default time of a firm or client, and the setting of life insurance where $\tau$ is the death time of an agent. It is clear that random times can not be observed before their occurrence. Thus the larger filtration $\mathbb{G}$, which incorporates $\mathbb{F}$ and makes $\tau$ observable, results from the progressive enlargement of $\mathbb{F}$ with $\tau$. For this informational setting, governed by $\mathbb{G}$, we analyze the optimal stopping problem in three main directions. The first direction consists of characterizing the existence of the solution to this problem in terms of $\mathbb{F}$-observable processes. The second direction lies in deriving the {\it mathematical structures} of the value process of this control problem, while the third direction singles out the associated optimal stopping problem under $\mathbb{F}$. These three aspects allow us to quantify deeply how $\tau$ impact the optimal stopping problem, while they are also vital for studying reflected backward stochastic differential equations which arise {\it naturally} from pricing and hedging of vulnerable claims.</description>

These equations include the stochastic Fisher--KPP equations, stochastic Allen--Cahn, stochastic Newell--Whitehead--Segel, and stochastic Fujita--Gelfand equations. By implementing the theory of $C_0-$semigroups and evolution systems into the chaos expansion theory in infinite dimensional spaces, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for this class of stochastic partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>New asymptotic expansion formula via Malliavin calculus and its application to rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generic asymptotic expansion formula of expectations of multidimensional Wiener functionals through a Malliavin calculus technique. The uniform estimate of the asymptotic expansion is shown under a weaker condition on the Malliavin covariance matrix of the target Wiener functional. In particular, the method provides a tractable expansion for the expectation of an irregular functional of the solution to a multidimensional rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&lt;1/2$, without using complicated fractional integral calculus for the singular kernel. In a numerical experiment, our expansion shows a much better approximation for a probability distribution function than its normal approximation, which demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: We prove well-posedness results for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) and reflected BSDEs with an optional obstacle process in the case of appropriately weighted $\mathbb{L}^2$-data when the generator is integrated with respect to a possibly purely discontinuous process. This leads to a unified treatment of discrete-time and continuous-time (reflected) BSDEs. We compare our well-posedness results with the current literature and highlight that our results are sharp and cannot be improved within the framework presented here. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions for a comparison principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study branching fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(1/2,1)$. The construction relies on a generalization of the discrete approximation of fractional Brownian motion (Hammond and Sheffield, Probability Theory and Related Fields, 2013) to power law P\'olya urns indexed by trees. We show that the first order of the speed of branching fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ is $ct^{H+1/2}$ where $c$ is explicit and only depends on the Hurst parameter. A notion of "branching property" for processes with memory emerges naturally from our construction.</description>

Abstract: Given some binary matrix $M$, suppose we are presented with the collection of its rows and columns in independent arbitrary orderings. From this information, are we able to recover the unique original orderings and matrix? We present an algorithm that identifies whether there is a unique ordering associated with a set of rows and columns, and outputs either the unique correct orderings for the rows and columns or the full collection of all valid orderings and valid matrices. We show that there is a constant $c &gt; 0$ such that the algorithm terminates in $O(n^2)$ time with high probability and in expectation for random $n \times n$ binary matrices with i.i.d.\ Bernoulli $(p)$ entries $(m_{ij})_{ij=1}^n$ such that $\frac{c\log^2(n)}{n(\log\log(n))^2} \leq p \leq \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the well-posedness of stochastic S-KdV driven by multiplicative noises in $H_x^1\times H_x^1$. To get the local well-posedness, we first develop the bilinear and trilinear Bourgain norm estimates of the nonlinear terms with $b\in\left(0,1/2\right)$. Then, to overcome the lack of the maximum functional estimate, we introduce a series of approximation equations with localized nonlinear terms, which are also cutted-off in both the physical and the Fourier space. By limitations, these approximation equations will help us get a priori estimate in the Bourgain space and finish the proof of the global well-posedness of the initial system.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by $n\ln n$, it converges to $2/7$ in probability.</description>

      <title>Tight matrices and heavy traffic steady state convergence in queueing networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Braverman et al. (2024), the authors prove that the stationary distribution of a multiclass queueing network converges to the stationary distribution of a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) in heavy traffic. Among the sufficient conditions for the convergence is that the reflection matrix $R$ of the SRBM is "tight". In this paper, we study how we can verify this tightness of $R$. For a $2$-dimensional SRBM, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $R$ to be tight, while, for a general dimension, we only give sufficient conditions. We then apply these results to the SRBMs arising from the diffusion approximations of multiclass queueing networks with static buffer priority service disciplines that are studied in Braverman et al. (2024). It is shown that $R$ is always tight for this network with two stations if $R$ is defined and completely-S. For the case of more than two stations, it is shown that $R$ is tight for reentrant lines with last-buffer-first-service (LBFS) discipline, but it is not always tight for reentrant line with first-buffer-first-service (FBFS) discipline.</description>

Abstract: This paper shows that to compute the Haar state on $\mathbb{O}(SL_q(n))$, it suffices to compute the Haar states of a special type of monomials which we define as standard monomials. Then, we provide an algorithm to explicitly compute the Haar states of standard monomials on $\mathbb{O}(SL_q(3))$ with reasonable computational cost. The numerical results on $\mathbb{O}(SL_q(3))$ will be used in the future study of the $q$-deformed Weingarten function.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit algebraic example of a subshift of finite type over a group $\Gamma$ with an invariant Markov measure which has completely positive sofic entropy (with respect to `most' sofic approximations) and yet does not have a direct Bernoulli factor, because its model spaces shatter into exponentially many clusters of sub-exponential size. The example and its analysis are related to random low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>
