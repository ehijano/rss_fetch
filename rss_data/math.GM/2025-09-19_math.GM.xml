      <title>Geographic Characterisation of Children's Health and Wellbeing through Vulnerability Indices Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Australian children as a case study, this paper aims to develop vulnerability indices to characterise the health and well-being of children aged 0-5 years old. The indices are used to identify differences in children's health and well-being across geographic regions and identify clusters of regions with similar characteristics. The approach is underpinned by two well-known statistical methods, namely Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering. The identification of these regions with similar vulnerability characteristics can then be used to derive new insights into drivers of children's health and well-being and support improved decision-making for services in Australia.</description>

      <title>Quantitative metrics for trait and identity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the role of demographic diversity in group settings requires effective quantitative metrics. Intersectional feminist theory has highlighted that demographic identities can intersect in complex ways, but most metrics used to study these traits are one-dimensional. In their paper "Diversity, identity, and data" (2025), Topaz et al. introduced two novel metrics that capture multiple aspects of demographic identities among group members: "intersecting diversity" and "shared identity". We present a mathematical framework to provide probabilistic interpretations for both metrics. Using these interpretations, we prove that these two measures are anti-correlated and establish tight bounds on their possible combined values, demonstrating that there is no clear "optimal" point that maximizes both metrics. We apply these metrics in three case studies on Hollywood movies, the television show "Survivor", and a random sample of North American companies in which we explore their bounds and anti-correlation as well as their relationship to group performance in these settings. By formalizing the mathematical structure for these metrics and demonstrating their empirical relevance, we provide a foundation for researchers across the social sciences, mathematics, and related fields to more precisely quantify distributions of intersecting traits within groups and better understand their implications for group dynamics and performance.</description>

      <title>Sectorial Green Functions in the Ternary Algebra C3 and Their Curved-Space Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green functions associated with higher-order differential operators typically lead to special-function expressions in curved or bounded geometries, obscuring analytic transparency. In this work we develop the sectorial Green function for the cubic operator $(D^3+1)$ within the ternary algebra $C_3$ (defined by $j^3=-1$). The algebra admits three exponential carriers and divides the complex plane into six Stokes sectors, in each of which the Green kernel assumes a closed exponential--trigonometric form. We compute explicit responses to box and Gaussian sources, extend the construction to higher algebras $C_4$ and $C_5$, and interpret the resulting kernels as propagators for multi-carrier quantum systems. The central novelty is that, unlike the quadratic $(D^2+1)$ case where curved backgrounds induce Bessel or Airy functions, the $C_3$ Green function in curved space reduces exactly to its flat-space form upon reparametrization by the geodesic coordinate. Curvature merely deforms the coordinate without altering the analytic structure, ensuring closed-form transparency even in curved geometries.</description>

      <title>Every sufficiently large odd integer is a sum of two positive perfect squares and a prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every sufficiently large odd integer is a sum of two positive squares and a prime. Let R(n) be the number of representations n = x^2 + y^2 + p with x, y &gt;= 1 and p prime. We show that R(n) &gt; 0 for all odd n &gt;= n0 and obtain the asymptotic formula R(n) = S(n) C n / log n, where S(n) &gt; 0 is the singular series and C &gt; 0 is the singular integral. The proof uses the Hardy-Littlewood circle method: on the major arcs we extract the main term, and on the minor arcs we combine an L2 bound for the prime exponential sum (via the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem, the large sieve, and the Vaughan-Heath-Brown identity) with a fourth moment estimate for the quadratic Weyl sum. A p-adic local analysis, including the 2-adic case, shows S(n) &gt; 0 for odd n. We work with the standard logarithmic weight on primes and pass to the unweighted count by partial summation.</description>
