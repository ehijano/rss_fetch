      <title>Antibiotic Resistance Microbiology Dataset (ARMD): A De-identified Resource for Studying Antimicrobial Resistance Using Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Antibiotic Resistance Microbiology Dataset (ARMD) is a de-identified resource derived from electronic health records (EHR) that facilitates research into antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ARMD encompasses data from adult patients, focusing on microbiological cultures, antibiotic susceptibilities, and associated clinical and demographic features. Key attributes include organism identification, susceptibility patterns for 55 antibiotics, implied susceptibility rules, and de-identified patient information. This dataset supports studies on antimicrobial stewardship, causal inference, and clinical decision-making. ARMD is designed to be reusable and interoperable, promoting collaboration and innovation in combating AMR. This paper describes the dataset's acquisition, structure, and utility while detailing its de-identification process.</description>

      <title>Towards species' classification of the \textit{Anastrepha pseudoparallela} group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying \textit{Anastrepha} species from the \textit{pseudoparallela} group is problematic due to morphological similarities among species and a broad geographic variation. This group comprises $31$ species of fruit flies and pests affecting passion fruit crops. Identifying these species utilises the morphological characteristics of the specimens' wings and aculeus tips. Considering the importance of identifying these species of this group and challenges due to the low data availability and class imbalance, this paper contributes to automating the classification of the species \textit{Anastrepha chiclayae} Greene, \textit{Anastrepha consobrina} (Loew), \textit{Anastrepha curitibana} Ara\'ujo, Norrbom \&amp; Savaris, \textit{Anastrepha curitis} Stone, and \textit{Anastrepha pseudoparallela} (Loew) using deep Learning methods and designing new features based on wing structures. We explored transfer learning solutions and proposed a new set of features based on each wing's structure. We used the dual annealing algorithm to optimise the hyperparameters of Deep Neural Networks, Random Forests, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines combined with autoencoders and SMOTE algorithms to account for class imbalance. We tested our approach with a dataset of $127$ high-quality images belonging to a total of $5$ species and used three-fold cross validation for training, tuning and testing, encompassing six permutations of those to assess the performance of the learning algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that our novel approach, which combines feature extraction and machine learning techniques, can improve the species classification accuracy for rare \textit{Anastrepha pseudoparallela} group specimens, with the SMOTE and Random Forests algorithms leading to the average performance of $0.72$ in terms of the mean of the individual accuracies considering all species.</description>

      <title>Visual Attention Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual attention plays a critical role when our visual system executes active visual tasks by interacting with the physical scene. However, how to encode the visual object relationship in the psychological world of our brain deserves to be explored. In the field of computer vision, predicting visual fixations or scanpaths is a usual way to explore the visual attention and behaviors of human observers when viewing a scene. Most existing methods encode visual attention using individual fixations or scanpaths based on the raw gaze shift data collected from human observers. This may not capture the common attention pattern well, because without considering the semantic information of the viewed scene, raw gaze shift data alone contain high inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this issue, we propose a new attention representation, called Attention Graph, to simultaneously code the visual saliency and scanpath in a graph-based representation and better reveal the common attention behavior of human observers. In the attention graph, the semantic-based scanpath is defined by the path on the graph, while saliency of objects can be obtained by computing fixation density on each node. Systemic experiments demonstrate that the proposed attention graph combined with our new evaluation metrics provides a better benchmark for evaluating attention prediction methods. Meanwhile, extra experiments demonstrate the promising potentials of the proposed attention graph in assessing human cognitive states, such as autism spectrum disorder screening and age classification.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Omics Framework for Survival Mediation Analysis of High-Dimensional Proteogenomic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis plays a crucial role in understanding time-to-event (survival) outcomes such as disease progression. Despite recent advancements in causal mediation frameworks for survival analysis, existing methods are typically based on Cox regression and primarily focus on a single exposure or individual omics layers, often overlooking multi-omics interplay. This limitation hinders the full potential of integrated biological insights. In this paper, we propose SMAHP, a novel method for survival mediation analysis that simultaneously handles high-dimensional exposures and mediators, integrates multi-omics data, and offers a robust statistical framework for identifying causal pathways on survival outcomes. This is one of the first attempts to introduce the accelerated failure time (AFT) model within a multi-omics causal mediation framework for survival outcomes. Through simulations across multiple scenarios, we demonstrate that SMAHP achieves high statistical power, while effectively controlling false discovery rate (FDR), compared with two other approaches. We further apply SMAHP to the largest head-and-neck carcinoma proteogenomic data, detecting a gene mediated by a protein that influences survival time.</description>

      <title>Cell as Point: One-Stage Framework for Efficient Cell Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches rely heavily on detection or segmentation in each frame as a prerequisite, requiring substantial resources for high-quality segmentation masks and increasing the overall prediction time. To address these limitations, we propose CAP, a novel end-to-end one-stage framework that reimagines cell tracking by treating Cell as Point. Unlike traditional methods, CAP eliminates the need for explicit detection or segmentation, instead jointly tracking cells for sequences in one stage by leveraging the inherent correlations among their trajectories. This simplification reduces both labeling requirements and pipeline complexity. However, directly processing the entire sequence in one stage poses challenges related to data imbalance in capturing cell division events and long sequence inference. To solve these challenges, CAP introduces two key innovations: (1) adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling, which prioritizes cell division events to mitigate the occurrence imbalance of cell events, and (2) the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference strategy, which ensures continuous and stable tracking of newly emerging cells over extended sequences. By removing the dependency on segmentation-based preprocessing while addressing the challenges of imbalanced occurrence of cell events and long-sequence tracking, CAP demonstrates promising cell tracking performance and is 10 to 55 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and model checkpoints will be available soon.</description>
