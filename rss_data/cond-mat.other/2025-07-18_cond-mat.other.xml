      <title>State transfer analysis for linear spin chains with non-uniform on-site energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High fidelity state transfer is an important ingredient of distributed quantum information processing. We present and analyse results on perfect and quasi-perfect state transfer with linear spin chains incorporating non-uniform on-site energies. The motivation is maintenance of coupling uniformity, which could be beneficial for some physical implementations. We relate this coupling uniformity to a particle in a discrete potential analogue. Our analysis further considers the statistical variation in couplings and on-site energies, as a function of increasing chain site number N.</description>

      <title>Local nanoscale probing of electron spins using NV centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique. Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation dose.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Thermalization via Participation Ratio in Disordered Bosonic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization in a disordered one-dimensional interacting bosonic system described by the Aubry-Andre model using full exact diagonalization. We find a broad chaotic energy window where the system's eigenstates satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), demonstrated by the smooth energy dependence of observables like entanglement entropy and local particle number, whose fluctuations decrease with system size. Dynamically, we investigate the equilibration of initial Fock states and find that thermalization is not universal. The key finding is a direct and nontrivial correlation between an initial state's delocalization in the energy eigenbasis quantified by the Participation Ratio (PR) and its subsequent equilibration. States with a high PR consistently evolve toward the microcanonical ensemble prediction, whereas those exhibiting a low PR display deviations whose magnitude inversely correlates with the PR value. This connection is quantitatively confirmed by the trace distance, providing a powerful, experimentally relevant diagnostic for predicting which initial states will reach thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On the origins of charge transport in spin crossover complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly promising candidates for a myriad of potential applications in room-temperature electronics; however, as it stands, establishing a clear connection between their spin-state switching and transport properties has been far from trivial. In this Perspective, an effort to unravel the underlying charge transport mechanism in these SCO complexes, via a general theory, is made. The theory presented herein is aimed at providing a unifying picture that explains the widely different trends observed in the spin-crossover-dependent carrier transport properties in the SCO molecular thin film systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
