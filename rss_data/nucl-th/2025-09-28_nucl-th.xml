      <title>Neutron Skin from Conserved Charge Measurements at Collider Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for measuring the neutron skin of heavy nuclei using collider experiments. Specifically, we demonstrate that the neutron skin thickness of the lead nucleus can be extracted in $p$+$^{208}$Pb collisions by analyzing a double ratio: The ratio of net electric charge to net baryon number measured near the lead-going rapidity, taken for high-multiplicity events and divided by the same ratio for low-multiplicity events. We compute the expected sensitivity of the double ratio to the neutron skin within a comprehensive (3+1)D relativistic hydrodynamic framework that incorporates multiple conserved charge currents and a charge-dependent lattice-QCD-based equation of state. We provide predictions for both $p$+$^{208}$Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=72}$~GeV and $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$~TeV, corresponding to the center of mass energies realized in the SMOG2 fixed-target setup at LHCb and the LHC collider mode, respectively.</description>

      <title>Isoenergetic description of induced fission pathways within energy-density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermodynamically consistent description of induced fission pathways in the superheavy nucleus $^{296}$Lv is presented within the framework of nuclear energy-density functional theory. Using self-consistent finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations with the Skyrme-type energy-density functional SkM$^*$, we derive and compare effective potentials corresponding to different thermodynamic processes -- isothermal ($T=\text{const}$), isentropic ($S=\text{const}$), and isoenergetic ($E=\text{const}$) -- as functions of quadrupole deformation and excitation energy. At the same amount of excitation energy the isoenergetic description predicts the highest fission barrier and the largest damping factor. The suppression of the isoenergetic fission barrier is analyzed by examining how the driving force changes with increasing excitation energy and by studying the contribution of the nonpotential term to the effective potential. Within the framework of the three thermodynamic schemes considered, the different behavior of temperature and entropy along the fission pathway is also emphasized. A transition of the effective level-density parameter from a deformation-sensitive quantity at low excitation energies to a nearly constant value at high energies is observed, in line with the Fermi-gas model expectations.</description>

      <title>Cumulative proton production in $pd$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model of backward proton production in the exclusive reaction $pd \to ppn$ at proton beam momenta up to several GeV/c is constructed on the basis of Feynman diagrams for one- and two-step amplitudes. The latter include nucleon and $\Delta(1232)$ resonance intermediate scattering states with propagators reduced to eikonal form using the generalized eikonal approximation. The model calculations are compared with available experimental data on the energy spectra of protons at backward polar angles in the deuteron rest frame. It is shown that inclusion of two-step amplitudes significantly increases the production of backward protons with energies above $\sim$ 50 MeV, thereby significantly improving the agreement with experiment. The remaining theoretical problem related to the description of the off-shell behavior of the elementary amplitudes of the $NN \to NN$ and $NN \leftrightarrow N\Delta$ transitions is discussed. Partial discrepancies between different sets of experimental data do not allow us to conclude that exotic effects, such as proton interactions with density fluctuations and/or $6q$ clusters in the deuteron, are present.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of ultra-high energy cosmic ray interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonuclear interactions between ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei and surrounding photon fields are key to understanding the connection between the compositions observed at Earth and those emitted from the sources. These interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available. Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources.</description>

      <title>Dynamical gluon effects in the three-dimensional structure of pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of the pion, including the contributions from one dynamical gluon, using the basis light-front quantization (BLFQ) approach. By solving a light-front QCD Hamiltonian with a three-dimensional confining potential, we obtain the light-front wavefunctions (LFWFs) for both the quark-antiquark and quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sectors. These wavefunctions are then employed to compute the unpolarized generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of valence quarks and gluons. We also extract the transverse spatial distributions, providing the squared radii of quark and gluon densities in the impact-parameter space. This work contributes toward a three-dimensional understanding of the pion's internal structure in both momentum and coordinate space.</description>

      <title>Recent progress in modeling neutrino-nucleus interactions for oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of accelerator-based neutrino experiments crucially depends on the good control of nuclear effects in the neutrino interactions with the detectors. Recently the focus of both experimental measurements and theoretical studies has moved from the inclusive channel, where only the final lepton is detected, to the more challenging semi-inclusive reactions, where one or more hadrons are detected in coincidence with the lepton. In this contribution we present our recent research of the semi-inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu p)$ reaction on carbon for the quasielastic and the two-particle-two-hole channels. We show some representative results and their comparison with experimental data, illustrating the robustness of the theoretical approach and discussing possible improvements to the model.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the measured anisotropy $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method fulfills the general premise of measuring the CME but is statistically hungry. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background-contributing sources, because of statistical fluctuations of intertwining variables used in the method, and is thus not practically useful or clean to measure the CME.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>A $\nu$ look at the Sun: Probing the conditions of the solar core using $^8$B neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the coming age of precision neutrino physics, neutrinos from the Sun become robust probes of the conditions of the solar core. Here, we focus on $^8$B neutrinos, for which there are already high precision measurements by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. Using only basic physical principles and straightforward statistical tools, we estimate projected constraints on the temperature and density of the $^8$B neutrino production zone compared to a reference solar model. We outline how to better understand the astrophysics of the solar interior using forthcoming neutrino data and solar models. Finally, we note that detailed forward modeling will be needed to develop the full potential of this approach.</description>
