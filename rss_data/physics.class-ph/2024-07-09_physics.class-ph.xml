      <title>An embedding-aware continuum thin shell formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting-edge smart materials are transforming the domains of soft robotics, actuators, and sensors by harnessing diverse non-mechanical stimuli, such as electric and magnetic fields. Accurately modelling their physical behaviour necessitates an understanding of the complex interactions between the structural deformation and the fields in the surrounding medium. For thin shell structures, this challenge is addressed by developing a shell model that effectively incorporates the three-dimensional field it is embedded in by appropriately accounting for the relevant boundary conditions. This study presents a model for the nonlinear deformation of thin hyperelastic shells, incorporating Kirchhoff-Love assumptions and a rigorous variational approach. The shell theory is derived from 3D nonlinear elasticity by dimension reduction while preserving the boundary conditions at the top and bottom surfaces of the shell. Consequently, unlike classical shell theories, this approach can distinguish between pressure loads applied at the top and bottom surfaces, and delivers a platform to include multi-physics coupling. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theory and provide a physical interpretation of the novel mechanical variables of the model.</description>

      <title>On the locus formed by the maximum heights of an ultra-relativistic projectile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of relativistic projectiles in a uniform gravitational force field. For the first time, we have found the curve that joins the points of maximum height of all trajectories followed by a projectile in the ultra-relativistic limit. The parametric equations of this curve produce an onion-like curve; in fact, it is one of the loops of a lemniscate-type curve. We also verify that the curve is an ellipse in the nonrelativistic approximation. These two limiting results are obtained by following two slightly distinct approaches. In addition, we calculate the nonrelativistic and ultra-relativistic approximations of the trajectory equation and parametric equations of the trajectory as functions of time. All limiting cases in the article are studied in detail. The content of the article is appropriate for advanced undergraduate students.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Learning: From Autoencoders to Truly Autonomous Learning Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that accurately predicted information can serve as an energy source paves the way for new approaches to autonomous learning. The energy derived from a sequence of successful predictions can be recycled as an immediate incentive and resource, driving the enhancement of predictive capabilities in AI agents. We propose that, through a series of straightforward meta-architectural adjustments, any unsupervised learning apparatus could achieve complete independence from external energy sources, evolving into a self-sustaining physical system with a strong intrinsic 'drive' for continual learning. This concept, while still purely theoretical, is exemplified through the autoencoder, a quintessential model for unsupervised efficient coding. We use this model to demonstrate how progressive paradigm shifts can profoundly alter our comprehension of learning and intelligence. By reconceptualizing learning as an energy-seeking process, we highlight the potential for achieving true autonomy in learning systems, thereby bridging the gap between algorithmic concepts and physical models of intelligence.</description>

      <title>Design and Reprogrammability of Zero Modes in 2D Materials from a Single Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical extremal materials, a class of metamaterials that exist at the bounds of elastic theory, possess the extraordinary capability to engineer any desired elastic behavior by harnessing mechanical zero modes -- deformation modes that demand minimal or no elastic energy. However, the potential for arbitrary construction and reprogramming of metamaterials remains largely unrealized, primarily due to significant challenges in qualitatively transforming zero modes within the confines of existing metamaterial design frameworks. In this work, we show a method for explicitly defining and in situ reprogramming zero modes of two-dimensional extremal materials by employing straight-line mechanisms (SLMs) and planar symmetry, which prescribe and coordinate the zero modes, respectively. We design, test, and reprogram centimeter-scale isotropic, orthotropic, and chiral extremal materials by reorienting the SLMs in place, enabling these materials to smoothly and reversibly interpolate between extremal modalities (e.g., unimode to bimode) and material properties (e.g., negative to positive Poisson's ratios) without changing the metamaterial's global structure. Our methodology provides a straightforward and explicit strategy for the design and tuning of all varieties of two-dimensional extremal materials, enabling arbitrary and dynamic mechanical metamaterial construction to completely cover the gamut of elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Jacobi last multiplier and two-dimensional superintegrable oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the role of the Jacobi last multiplier in the context of two-dimensional oscillators. We first consider two-dimensional unit-mass oscillators admitting a separable Hamiltonian description, i.e., $H = H_1 + H_2$, where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the Hamiltonians of two one-dimensional unit-mass oscillators; it is shown that there exists a third functionally-independent first integral $\Theta$, thereby ensuring superintegrablility. Various examples are explicitly worked out. We then consider position-dependent-mass oscillators and the Bateman pair, where the latter consists of a pair of dissipative linear oscillators. Quite remarkably, the Bateman pair is found to be superintegrable, despite admitting a Hamiltonian which cannot be separated into those of two isolated (non-interacting) one-dimensional oscillators.</description>

      <title>A reappraisal of Lagrangians with non-quadratic velocity dependence and branched Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians with non-quadratic velocity dependence have found attention in the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched Hamiltonians.</description>
