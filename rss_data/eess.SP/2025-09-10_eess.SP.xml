      <title>Cross-device Zero-shot Label Transfer via Alignment of Time Series Foundation Model Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g., actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models (TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations. Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label transfer across device type.</description>

      <title>Cross-field SNR Analysis and Tensor Channel Estimation for Multi-UAV Near-field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems. We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model, within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor, enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP, while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Techniques for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems: State-of-the-Art, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities, is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However, integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques, DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Doppler Shift in Cislunar Environment with Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the RF-based Doppler shift distribution characterization of the Lunar South Pole (LSP) based inter-satellite link (ISL) in varying inclination. Doppler shift in parts per million (ppm) is determined and analyzed, as it provides an independence from the carrier frequency. Due to unknown relative velocity states duration, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is found to be the best fitting distribution for ISLs with $1^\circ$ inclination interval Doppler shift with respect to a predetermined satellite. Goodness-of-fit is investigated and quantified with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and weighted mean relative difference (WMRD) error metrics. Simulation results show that ISL Doppler shifts reach up to $\pm1.89$ ppm as the inclination of the other orbit deviates higher from the reference orbit, inclining $80^\circ$. Regarding the error measurements of GMM fitting, the WMRD and KL divergence metrics for ISL take values up to 0.6575 and 2.2963, respectively.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fading Correlation on the High-SNR Regime of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses three critical limitations in previous analyses of RIS-aided wireless systems: propagation environments with fixed diversity gain, restricted spatial correlation profiles, and approximation methods that fail to capture the system behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. To overcome these challenges, we conduct an exact asymptotic analysis focused on the left tail of the SNR distribution, which plays a critical role in high-SNR system performance. Additionally, to account for general correlation profiles and fading environments with variable diversity and coding gains, we consider arbitrarily correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The analytical results show that fading correlation induces a horizontal shift in the asymptotic behavior -- represented as a straight line in the log-dB scale -- of the PDF and CDF, displacing these curves to the left. The asymptotic linear coefficient quantifies this shift, while the angular coefficient remains unaffected. Moreover, the results reveal that the high sensitivity of the linear coefficient to correlation arises from the aggregated contribution of all marginal asymptotic terms, effectively capturing each channel's correlation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Joint Spatial and Spectral Hybrid Precoding for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems cannot rely solely on digital precoding due to hardware constraints. Instead, hybrid precoding, which combines digital and radio frequency (RF) techniques, has emerged as a potential alternative. This approach strikes a balance between performance and cost, addressing the limitations of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters in mmWave systems. mmWave systems are designed to function in wideband channels with frequency selectivity, necessitating the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate dispersive channels. However, OFDM faces several challenges. First, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) due to the linear combination of subcarriers. Second, it suffers from out-of-band (OOB) emissions due to the sharp spectral transitions of OFDM subcarriers and windowing-induced spectral leakage. Furthermore, phase shifter (PS) impairments at the RF transmitter precoder and the user combiner represent a limitation in practical mmWave systems, leading to phase errors. This work addresses these challenges.
  We study the problem of robust digital-RF precoding optimization for the downlink sum-rate maximization in hybrid multi-user (MU) MIMO-OFDM systems under maximum transmit power, PAPR, and OOB emission constraints. The formulated maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We propose a weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize digital-RF precoders at the transmitter and digital-RF combiners at the users. Low-cost and scalable optimization approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems. Extensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches and exhibit their superiority relative to well-known benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Experimental Analysis of Biasing Voltage Generation in Wave-Controlled RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), an emerging technology proposed for inclusion in next generation wireless communication systems, are programmable surfaces that can adaptively reflect incident electromagnetic radiation in different desired directions. To reduce the complexity and physical profile of conventional RIS designs, a novel concept known as Wave-Controlled RIS has been proposed, in which standing waves along a transmission line are used to generate the required dc bias for reflective control. This paper shows the design of such a Wave-Controlled RIS and its biasing transmission line. The effectiveness of this approach in generating the correct dc bias from a single standing wave frequency is analyzed through both theoretical modeling and experimental validation, which uncovered a dependence on impedance matching not accounted for by the theory. Additionally, the potential for reflective control using only a single standing wave frequency on the biasing transmission line is explored, demonstrating the ability of single-beam steering toward angles near broadside.</description>

      <title>Eye Movement Feature-Guided Signal De-Drifting in Electrooculography Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrooculography (EOG) is widely used for gaze tracking in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). However, baseline drift caused by low-frequency noise significantly impacts the accuracy of EOG signals, creating challenges for further sensor fusion. This paper presents an Eye Movement Feature-Guided De-drift (FGD) method for mitigating drift artifacts in EOG signals. The proposed approach leverages active eye-movement feature recognition to reconstruct the feature-extracted EOG baseline and adaptively correct signal drift while preserving the morphological integrity of the EOG waveform. The FGD is evaluated using both simulation data and real-world data, achieving a significant reduction in mean error. The average error is reduced to 0.896{\deg} in simulation, representing a 36.29% decrease, and to 1.033{\deg} in real-world data, corresponding to a 26.53% reduction. Despite additional and unpredictable noise in real-world data, the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional de-drifting techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications such as enhancing human performance augmentation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Intelligent Channel Modeling Framework for 6G-Enabled Networked Intelligent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and technology development of 6G-enabled networked intelligent systems needs an accurate real-time channel model as the cornerstone. However, with the new requirements of 6G-enabled networked intelligent systems, the conventional channel modeling methods face many limitations. Fortunately, the multi-modal sensors equipped on the intelligent agents bring timely opportunities, i.e., the intelligent integration and mutually beneficial mechanism between communications and multi-modal sensing could be investigated based on the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In this case, the mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic channel could be explored via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). This article presents a novel multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) framework for 6G-enabled networked intelligent systems, which establishes a nonlinear model between multi-modal sensing and channel characteristics, including large-scale and small-scale channel characteristics. The architecture and features of proposed intelligent modeling framework are expounded and the key technologies involved are also analyzed. Finally, the system-engaged applications and potential research directions of MMICM framework are outlined.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal Feature Extraction in EHG Signals and Tocograms for Enhanced Preterm Birth Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term health complications. Early detection is essential for enabling timely medical interventions. Electrohysterography (EHG) and tocography (TOCO) are promising non invasive tools for PTB prediction, but prior studies often suffer from class imbalance, improper oversampling, and reliance on features with limited physiological relevance. This work presents a machine learning pipeline incorporating robust preprocessing, physiologically grounded feature extraction, and rigorous evaluation. Features were extracted from EHG (and TOCO) signals using Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, statistical descriptors of wavelet coefficients, and peaks of the normalized power spectrum. Signal quality was enhanced via Karhunen Lo\`eve Transform (KLT) denoising through eigenvalue based subspace decomposition. Multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, and CatBoost, were evaluated on the TPEHGT dataset. The CatBoost classifier with KLT denoising achieved the highest performance on fixed interval segments of the TPEHGT dataset, reaching 97.28% accuracy and an AUC of 0.9988. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of both KLT denoising and physiologically informed features. Comparative analysis showed that including TOCO signals did not substantially improve prediction over EHG alone, highlighting the sufficiency of EHG for PTB detection. These results demonstrate that combining denoising with domain relevant features can yield highly accurate, robust, and clinically interpretable models, supporting the development of cost effective and accessible PTB prediction tools, particularly in low resource healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>SA-OOSC: A Multimodal LLM-Distilled Semantic Communication Framework for Enhanced Coding Efficiency with Scenario Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces SA-OOSC, a multimodal large language models (MLLM)-distilled semantic communication framework that achieves efficient semantic coding with scenario-aware importance allocations. This approach addresses a critical limitation of existing object-oriented semantic communication (OOSC) systems - assigning static importance values to specific classes of objects regardless of their contextual relevance. Our framework utilizes MLLMs to identify the scenario-augmented (SA) semantic importance for objects within the image. Through knowledge distillation with the MLLM-annotated data, our vectorization/de-vectorization networks and JSCC encoder/decoder learn to dynamically allocate coding resources based on contextual significance, i.e., distinguishing between high-importance objects and low-importance according to the SA scenario information of the task. The framework features three core innovations: a MLLM-guided knowledge distillation pipeline, an importance-weighted variable-length JSCC framework, and novel loss function designs that facilitate the knowledge distillation within the JSCC framework. Experimental validation demonstrates our framework's superior coding efficiency over conventional semantic communication systems, with open-sourced MLLM-annotated and human-verified datasets established as new benchmarks for future research in semantic communications.</description>

      <title>Node Position Estimation in Diffusion-Based Molecular Communications Using Multi-Layer Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for accurately estimating the relative position between two nodes with unknown locations in a diffusion-based molecular communication environment. A specialized node structure is designed, combining a central absorbing receiver with multiple transmitters placed at predefined spherical coordinates. Pilot molecules are released, and their absorption time and concentration are measured. By partitioning the spherical coordinate space, these spatially distinct measurements serve as input to a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based model. The proposed method significantly improves the precision of distance and direction estimation. Simulation results demonstrate localization accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the neural network model in capturing the underlying physical characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Framework to Test the Resilience of Three-Fold Redundant Sparse Arrays Against Two Sensor Failures and Some Never-Before Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of sparse arrays progressed, numerous array designs have been introduced with a focus on larger apertures and higher degrees of freedom (DOFs), resulting in maximally economic sparse arrays (MESAs) that operate with the least number of sensors required to provide a given aperture while ensuring a hole-free difference coarray (DCA). Consequently, MESAs are least robust to sensor failures and cannot afford the failure of even a single sensor. Multifold redundant sparse arrays (MFRSAs) provide a practical solution to the problem of sensor failures in sparse arrays by making sure that the array contains enough sensor pairs necessary to produce each spatial lag multiple times. Owing to this property, a \b{eta}-fold redundant array can withstand simultaneous failure of at least \b{eta}-1 sensors without losing the hole-free DCA property. Nevertheless, MFRSAs are also prone to hidden dependencies that prevent them from being fully robust. In this work, we present a systematic framework to evaluate the robustness of triple redundant sparse linear arrays (TRSLAs) against all possible two-sensor failures. After detailing the proposed approach, we present the failure analysis of representative TRSLAs available in existing literature. It is found that existing TRSLAs have some hidden vulnerabilities against the failure of some peculiar sensor pairs. Corresponding MATLAB programs and numerical simulations are provided for evaluation and use by the array processing community. The proposed approach has a great archival value as it can evaluate the robustness of any present or future TRSLAs through objective means.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Computing in Time-Varying mmWave Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrated communication and computing (ICC) transceiver design in time-varying millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels. In particular, in order to cope with the dynamics of time-varying mmWave channels, the detection of communication symbols and the execution of an over-the-air computing (AirComp) operation are performed in parallel with channel tracking, as opposed to existing state-of-the-art (SotA) on ICC where perfect knowledge of the channel at all time instances is typically assumed. For clarity of exposition, we consider a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) uplink scenario where multiple single-antenna user equipment (UE) transmit to a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas, such that each UE, or edge device (ED), precodes its own transmit signal, while the BS, or access points (APs), also performs receive beamforming. The proposed transceiver framework then estimates channel state information (CSI) and data symbols in parallel, using a bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (BiGaBP) algorithm for joint channel and data detection (JCDE), aided by a channel prediction (CP) algorithm executed before each estimation window at the BS. The AirComp operation is then executed by means of an optimal combination of the residual signal. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in performing ICC in challenging time-varying mmWave channels, with minimal degradation to both communication and computing performance.</description>

      <title>A Methodological Framework for Positioning of Wireless Sensors in New Generation Launchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless sensor networks for reusable launchers, the electromagnetic characterization and electromagnetic compatibility analyses are relevant due to the reference operational scenario, which implies a complex, and sometimes dynamic, electromagnetic environment. This work proposes a methodological framework for the design of the network and for the analysis of the related electromagnetic environment within the stages of a given launcher. Based on the preliminary positioning of the network nodes, the framework prescribes a workflow and the related toolset for determining the optimal network topology focusing on the weights, the operation of the transceivers, and the overall radiated power. The optimal network configuration is simulated by using computational electromagnetics strategies in order to assess the electromagnetic environment induced by the sensor network itself. The paper provides some results concerning a case study for a specific launcher.</description>

      <title>Joint Antenna Positioning and Beamforming for Movable Antenna Array Aided Ground Station in Low-Earth Orbit Satellite Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new architecture for the low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite ground station aided by movable antenna (MA) array. Unlike conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the MA array can flexibly adjust antenna positions to reconfigure array geometry, for more effectively mitigating interference and improving communication performance in ultra-dense LEO satellite networks. To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna positions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during the whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of the ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and time-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual transformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective function into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV and AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the achievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing an efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO satellite communication networks.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Modulation Design for Fluid-Antenna SWIPT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the design of modulation schemes that improve the rate-energy region of fluid antenna-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. By considering the nonlinear characteristics of practical energy harvesting circuits, we formulate a dual-objective rate-energy (RE) region optimization problem to jointly maximize the discrete-input mutual information (DIMI) and harvested current. The problem is solved using the epsilon-constraint method and optimized constellations are designed for various energy harvesting thresholds. We then evaluate the performance of the optimized constellations under three different fluid antenna (FA) port selection strategies: (i) Best Port, (ii) Fixed Port, and (iii) Random Port. Our simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains of optimized constellations over conventional constellations in both information rate and energy harvesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication will be a key feature of future mobile networks, enabling highly efficient systems and numerous new applications by leveraging communication signals for sensing. In this paper, we analyze the impact of arbitrary modulation alphabets on the sensing performance of communication-centric OFDM systems as expected in the next-generation 6G networks. We evaluate existing interference mitigation techniques, such as coherent successive target cancellation, and propose an enhanced version of this algorithm. A systematic performance evaluation in multi-target scenarios, including the effects of scattering, demonstrates that our proposed interference mitigation methods achieve performance comparable to sensing-optimal constant modulus signals while utilizing higher order constellations for more efficient communications.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of Joint Clock Recovery and Equalization for Sub-Terahertz Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a joint clock recovery (CR) and equalization architecture tailored for high-speed sub-terahertz (sub-THz) wireless communication links. Specifically, a Baud-spaced digital receiver architecture is investigated that combines a constant modulus algorithm (CMA) equalizer with a blind timing error detector (TED), enabling robust symbol timing synchronization without decision-directed (DD) feedback or pilot symbols. The proposed TED leverages the CMA filter coefficients to estimate timing errors, which are then used to drive a Farrow interpolator operating at twice the symbol rate. The system is validated experimentally using a 140~GHz wireless testbed with 16-QAM modulation over a 10~GHz bandwidth. Results show that the proposed TED schemes outperform conventional blind TEDs, such as Gardner and blind implementations of Mueller \&amp; M\"uller, in terms of bit error rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), and intersymbol interference (ISI) suppression. These capabilities are especially relevant to next-generation spaceborne communication systems, where wideband sub-THz links are expected to play a key role in enabling ultra-high-data-rate inter-satellite and deep-space communications under challenging synchronization constraints.</description>

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone of 6G, enabling simultaneous environmental awareness and communication. This paper explores radio SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) as a key ISAC approach, using radio signals for mapping and localization. We analyze radio SLAM across different frequency bands, discussing trade-offs in coverage, resolution, and hardware requirements. We also highlight opportunities for integration with sensing, positioning, and cooperative networks.

      <description>arXiv:2509.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose enhancements to score-based generative modeling techniques for low-latency pilot-based channel estimation in a point-to-point single-carrier multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. Building on recent advances in score-based models, we investigate a specific noise schedule design and sampling acceleration by step-skipping to reduce the number of denoising steps during inference. We additionally propose a single-step signal-to-noise ratio informed denoiser as an extreme case of the step-skipping approach. Our methods achieve significant latency reductions without performance degradation, as demonstrated on a synthetic channel dataset representing an urban macrocell MIMO communications scenario.</description>

      <title>Estimating Cellular Network Delays in Finnish Railways: A Machine Learning Enhanced Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in using public cellular networks for specialized communication applications, replacing standalone sector-specific networks. One such application is transitioning from the aging GSM-R railway network to public 4G and 5G networks. Finland is modernizing its railway communication system through the Digirail project, leveraging public cellular networks. To evaluate network performance, a nationwide measurement campaign was conducted in two modes: Best Quality and Packet Replication. However, Best Quality mode introduces artificial delays, making it unsuitable for real-world assessments. In this paper, railway network delays are modeled using machine learning based on measurements from the Packet Replication mode. The best-performing model is then employed to generate a dataset estimating network delays across Finland's railway network. This dataset provides a more accurate representation of network performance. Machine learning based network performance prediction is shown to be feasible, and the results indicate that Finland's public cellular network can meet the stringent performance requirements of railway network control.</description>

      <title>Contrast-Free Ultrasound Microvascular Imaging via Radiality and Similarity Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microvascular imaging has advanced significantly with ultrafast data acquisition and improved clutter filtering, enhancing the sensitivity of power Doppler imaging to small vessels. However, the image quality remains limited by spatial resolution and elevated background noise, both of which impede visualization and accurate quantification. To address these limitations, this study proposes a high-resolution cross-correlation Power Doppler (HR-XPD) method that integrates spatial radiality weighting with Doppler signal coherence analysis, thereby enhancing spatial resolution while suppressing artifacts and background noise. Quantitative evaluations in simulation and in vivo experiments on healthy human liver, transplanted human kidney, and pig kidney demonstrated that HR-XPD significantly improves microvascular resolvability and contrast compared to conventional PD. In vivo results showed up to a 2 to 3-fold enhancement in spatial resolution and an increase in contrast by up to 20 dB. High-resolution vascular details were clearly depicted within a short acquisition time of only 0.3 s-1.2 s without the use of contrast agents. These findings indicate that HR-XPD provides an effective, contrast-free, and high-resolution microvascular imaging approach with broad applicability in both preclinical and clinical research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where the measurement noise can be correlated. Since it is an enhanced version of EM-based outlier robust filter (EMORF), we call it as EMORF-II. As it is equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy with an increased computational overhead. However, thankfully the computational complexity order remains at par with other practical methods making it a useful choice for diverse applications.</description>

Abstract: The complexity of large-scale 6G-and-beyond networks demands innovative approaches for multi-objective optimization over vast search spaces, a task often intractable. Quantum computing (QC) emerges as a promising technology for efficient large-scale optimization. We present our vision of leveraging QC to tackle key classes of problems in future mobile networks. By analyzing and identifying common features, particularly their graph-centric representation, we propose a unified strategy involving QC algorithms. Specifically, we outline a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.</description>

      <title>RAQ-MIMO: MIMO for Multi-Band Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) are capable of receiving multi-band radio-frequency (RF) signals simultaneously, which are expected to break Chu's limit for classical electronic antennas. However, signals from different users will interfere with each other in the optical intermediate frequency (IF) domain of the multi-band quantum receiver, which is termed the IF interference (IFI) problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQ-MIMO) by exploiting the additional spatial diversity of MIMO receivers. Specifically, by applying the dynamic signal model of RAQRs, we clarify the physical relationship between the quantum local oscillator (LO) configurations and the multi-band gains with the concept of quantum transconductance. Then, with the quantum transconductance-based signal model, we formulate the spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem and further propose the quantum weighted minimum mean square error (qWMMSE) algorithm, which jointly optimizes the quantum LO configurations and the classical precoder/combiner matrices. Furthermore, we test the qWMMSE algorithm within the standard space division multiple access (SDMA) scheme and the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the qWMMSE optimization framework can significantly improve the SE of RAQ-MIMO systems for both multiple access schemes, and that RAQ-MIMO systems can outperform classical electronic receiver-based multi-user MIMO systems by eliminating the mutual coupling effect between classical antennas.</description>

      <title>Sensor Management in Multi-Stage Stochastic Control Problems with Imperfect State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technological advancements in miniaturization and wireless communications are yielding more affordable and versatile sensors and, in turn, more applications in which a network of sensors can be actively managed to best support overall decision-making objectives. We propose modeling the opportunity for sensor management within multi-stage stochastic control problems with imperfect state information. Such formulations inherently assume the state of the modeled environment cannot be accessed directly but instead the controller can observe only noisy measurements of the state and, therefore, at each decision stage some form of state estimation is required before a control is actuated. The notion of sensor management arises when the modeled controls not only affect the subsequent evolution of the state but can also affect the nature of future measurements and, hence, the quality of state estimates that drive future control decisions. In principle, the optimal strategy for any appropriately modeled multi-stage stochastic control problem with imperfect state information (with or without opportunity for sensor management) is the solution to a dynamic program; in practice, the computational requirements are typically prohibitive yet dynamic programming methods are still useful to guide the development of effective suboptimal strategies. In this spirit, we model the opportunity for sensor management within small-scale examples of two well-studied dynamic programming formulations, namely (1) the finite-state/finite-action Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (PO-MDP) and (2) the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian Regulator (LQGR). These examples admit solvable dynamic programs and confirm how the interplay between sensing and acting is a natural by-product of a dynamic programming solution.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning time-varying graphs from spatiotemporal measurements. Given an appropriate prior on the temporal behavior of signals, our proposed method can estimate time-varying graphs from a small number of available measurements. To achieve this, we introduce two regularization terms in convex optimization problems that constrain sparseness of temporal variations of the time-varying networks. Moreover, a computationally-scalable algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the optimization problem. The experimental results with synthetic and real datasets (point cloud and temperature data) demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Wideband Communications: Interference Challenges and Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea of ultra-wideband (UWB) communications for short ranges (up to a few tens of meters) has been around for nearly three decades. However, despite significant efforts by the industry, UWB deployment has not yet reached its predicted potential. This article, thus, seeks to rectify this situation by providing a practical examination of UWB interference conditions. Through a spectrum survey of today's wireless environments, we explore the interference that UWB devices may face from a perspective of outage probability in both high- and low-rate configurations. We find that by suppressing interference, the outage probability can be reduced by one or more orders of magnitude. In the non-line-of sight channels, in particular, we find that both interference suppression and bandwidth expansion are required to support the minimum data rates suggested in the IEEE802.15.4 series of standards. We connect these findings to a recently proposed UWB signaling method based on filter banks and show this method fulfills the above requirements for implementing effective UWB systems.</description>

      <title>Upper Mid-Band Spectrum for 6G: Vision, Opportunity and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the pursuit of gigabit-per-second data speeds for future 6G mobile networks, in addition to the support of sensing and artificial intelligence applications, the industry is expanding beyond crowded sub-6 GHz bands with innovative new spectrum allocations. In this paper, we chart a compelling vision for 6G within the frequency range 3 (FR3) spectrum, i.e. $7.125$-$24.25$ $\GHz$, by delving into its key enablers and addressing the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead for these new frequency bands. Here we highlight the physical properties of this never-before used spectrum for cellular by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity tradeoffs, while examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output technologies, challenges for commercial deployment, and potential solutions for FR3, including multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of Radar Receive Filter and Unimodular ISAC Waveform with Sidelobe Level Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been considered a key feature of next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the joint design of the radar receive filter and dual-functional transmit waveform for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC system. While optimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the radar receive spatial response and maximizing the achievable rate at the communication receiver, besides the constraints of full-power radar receiving filter and unimodular transmit sequence, we control the maximum range sidelobe level, which is often overlooked in existing ISAC waveform design literature, for better radar imaging performance. To solve the formulated optimization problem with convex and nonconvex constraints, we propose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) algorithm. For each subproblem in the proposed inexact ALM algorithm, we custom-design a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) scheme with closed-form solutions for all blocks of variable to enhance the computational efficiency. Convergence analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to provide a stationary and feasible solution. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the impact of different system parameters on communication and radar imaging performance. Comparison with the existing works shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Embracing Diffraction: A Paradigm Shift in Wireless Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless signals are integral to modern society, enabling both communication and increasingly, environmental sensing. While various propagation models exist, ranging from empirical methods to full-wave simulations, the phenomenon of electromagnetic diffraction is often treated as a secondary effect or a correction factor. This paper positions diffraction as a fundamentally important and underutilized mechanism that is rich with information about the physical environment. Specifically, diffraction-inducing elements generate distinct signatures that are rich with information about their underlying properties such as their geometries. We then argue that by understanding and exploiting these relationships, diffraction can be harnessed strategically. We introduce a general optimization framework to formalize this concept, illustrating how diffraction can be leveraged for both inverse problems (sensing scene details such as object geometries from measured fields) and design problems (shaping radio frequency (RF) fields for communication objectives by configuring diffracting elements). Focusing primarily on edge diffraction and Keller's Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), we discuss specific applications in RF sensing for scene understanding and in communications for RF field programming, drawing upon recent work. Overall, this paper lays out a vision for systematically incorporating diffraction into the design and operation of future wireless systems, paving the way for enhanced sensing capabilities and more robust communication strategies.</description>

      <title>Multi-output Classification using a Cross-talk Architecture for Compound Fault Diagnosis of Motors in Partially Labeled Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled target datasets. Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based designs-for compound fault diagnosis under partially labeled conditions. Based on this investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk architecture, residual neural dimension reductor (RNDR), that enables selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition, frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented using a motor-based test setup and evaluated across six domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the structural advantage of RNDR is more pronounced in compound fault settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods. Lastly, we analyzed the RNDR with various conditions, other models with increased number of parameters, and compared with the ablated RNDR structure.</description>

      <title>Integrating Movable Antennas and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided movable antenna (MA) system, where multiple IRSs cooperate with a multi-MA base station to extend wireless coverage to multiple target areas. The objective is to maximize the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across all locations within these areas through joint optimization of MA positions, IRS phase shifts, and transmit beamforming. To achieve this while balancing the performance-cost trade-off, we propose three coverage-enhancement schemes: the area-adaptive MA-IRS scheme, where both MA positions and IRS phase shifts are adaptively adjusted for each target area; the area-adaptive MA-staIRS scheme, where only MA positions are adjusted, while IRS phase shifts remain unchanged after initial configuration (with staIRS denoting static IRSs); and the shared MA-staIRS scheme, where a common MA placement and static IRS configuration are applied across all areas. These schemes lead to challenging non-convex optimization problems with implicit objectives, which are difficult to solve optimally. To address these problems, we propose a general algorithmic framework that can solve each problem efficiently albeit suboptimally. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed MA-based schemes consistently outperform their fixed-position antenna (FPA)-based counterparts under both area-adaptive and static IRS configurations, with the area-adaptive MA-IRS scheme achieving the best worst-case SNR; 2) as transmit antennas are typically far fewer than IRS elements, the area-adaptive MA-staIRS scheme may underperform the baseline FPA scheme with area-adaptive IRSs in worst-case SNR, but a modest increase in antenna number can reverse this; 3) under a fixed total cost, the optimal MA-to-IRS-element ratio for worst-case SNR maximization is empirically found to be proportional to the reciprocal of their unit cost ratio.</description>

      <title>19.3 GHz Acoustic Filter with High Close-in Rejection in Tri-layer Thin-Film Lithium Niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic filters are preferred front-end solutions at sub-6 GHz due to their superior frequency selectivity compared to electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. With the ongoing development of 5G and the evolution toward 6G, there is a growing need to extend acoustic filter technologies into frequency range 3 (FR3), which spans 7 to 24 GHz to accommodate emerging high-frequency bands. However, scaling acoustic filters beyond 10 GHz presents significant challenges, as conventional platforms suffer from increased insertion loss (IL) and degraded out-of-band (OoB) rejection at higher frequencies. Recent innovations have led to the emergence of periodically poled piezoelectric lithium niobate (P3F LN) laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBARs), offering low-loss and high electromechanical coupling performance above 10 GHz. This work presents the first tri-layer P3F LN filter operating at 19.3 GHz, achieving a low IL of 2.2 dB, a 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 8.5%, and an impressive 49 dB close in rejection. These results demonstrate strong potential for integration into FR3 diplexers.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming Design for Pinching Antenna-assisted Symbiotic Radio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio framework enabled by the pinching antenna system (PASS), designed to enhance both primary and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. This reconfigurability introduces additional degrees of freedom for adaptive pinching beamforming, thereby enabling constructive signal enhancement and interference suppression tailored to the locations of the backscatter device, the Internet of Things (IoT) receiver, and the primary receivers. To fully exploit these benefits, we formulate a joint transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem that maximizes the achievable sum rate while satisfying the IoT receiver's detection error probability constraint and feasible deployment constraints for the pinching antennas. The resulting problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address this challenge, we develop two complementary solution approaches. The first is a learning-aided gradient descent method, where the constrained optimization is reformulated into a differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning. In this approach, the pinching antenna position matrix is reparameterized to automatically satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. The second approach is an optimization-based successive convex approximation-particle swarm optimization method, which first determines the transmit beamforming solution using successive convex approximation and subsequently optimizes pinching beamforming via a particle swarm optimization search over candidate pinching antenna placements.</description>

      <title>1-Bit Unlimited Sampling Beyond Fourier Domain: Low-Resolution Sampling of Quantization Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal acquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently constrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a trade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy consumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit depth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with low-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with Sigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However, SDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to handle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) addresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware, resulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a novel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and USF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise shaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited signals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains. (2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery method for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques, offering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive numerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a broader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) has attracted considerable attention. This paper considers the frequency-selective multipath fading environment and proposes DFRC waveform design schemes based on multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. In the proposed waveform design schemes, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the radar system, the inter-stream interference (ISI) and the achievable rate of the communication system, are respectively considered as the performance metrics. In this paper, we focus on the performance trade-off between the radar system and the communication system, and the optimization problems are formulated. In the ISI minimization based waveform design scheme, the optimization problem is convex and can be easily solved. In the achievable rate maximization based waveform design scheme, we propose a water-filling (WF) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based algorithm to derive the covariance matrix and the precoding matrix. Simulation results validate the proposed DFRC waveform designs and show that the achievable rate maximization based scheme has a better performance than the ISI minimization based scheme.</description>

      <title>Revisiting XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: When Dual-Wideband Effects Meet Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems introduces significant near-field effects, such as spherical wavefront propagation and spatially non-stationary (SnS) properties. When combined with the dual-wideband effects inherent to wideband systems, these phenomena fundamentally alter the channel's sparsity patterns in the angular-delay domain, rendering existing estimation methods insufficient. To address these challenges, this paper reconsiders the channel estimation problem for wideband XL-MIMO systems. Leveraging the spatial-chirp property of array responses, we first quantitatively characterize the angular-delay domain sparsity of wideband XL-MIMO channels, revealing both global block sparsity and local common-delay sparsity. To effectively capture this structured sparsity, we then propose a novel column-wise hierarchical prior model that integrates a precision sharing mechanism and a Markov random field (MRF) structure. Building on this prior model, the channel estimation task is formulated as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-based Bayesian inference problem. Tailored to the complex factor graph induced by this hierarchical prior, we develop a MMV-based hybrid message passing (MMV-HMP) algorithm. This algorithm performs message updates along the edges of the factor graph, and selectively applies either the variational message passing (VMP) or sum-product (SP) rules, depending on the factor-node structure and message tractability. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed column-wise hierarchical prior model through ablation studies and demonstrate that the MMV-HMP algorithm, while maintaining moderate computational complexity, consistently outperforms existing baselines which fail to capture the structured sparsity of wideband XL-MIMO channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Grover adaptive search (GAS) for a combinatorial optimization problem whose objective function involves spin variables. While the GAS algorithm with a conventional design of a quantum dictionary subroutine handles a problem associated with an objective function with binary variables $\{0,1\}$, we reformulate the problem using spin variables $\{+1,-1\}$ to simplify the algorithm. Specifically, we introduce a novel quantum dictionary subroutine that is designed for this spin-based formulation. A key benefit of this approach is the substantial reduction in the number of CNOT gates required to construct the quantum circuit. We theoretically demonstrate that, for certain problems, our proposed approach can reduce the gate complexity from an exponential order to a polynomial order, compared to the conventional binary-based approach. This improvement has the potential to enhance the scalability and efficiency of GAS, particularly in larger quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Direct Analytics on Semantic-aware Time Series Data Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle the challenges of massive growing data traffic and sustainable data communication. It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</description>

Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, pivotal to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), are emerging as a transformative transportation paradigm with the potential to redefine urban and regional mobility. While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</description>

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</description>
