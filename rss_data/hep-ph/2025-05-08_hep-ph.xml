      <title>BitHEP -- The Limits of Low-Precision ML in HEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern neural network architectures demands fast and memory-efficient implementations to mitigate computational bottlenecks. In this work, we evaluate the recently proposed BitNet architecture in HEP applications, assessing its performance in classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks. Specifically, we investigate its suitability for quark-gluon discrimination, SMEFT parameter estimation, and detector simulation, comparing its efficiency and accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that while BitNet consistently performs competitively in classification tasks, its performance in regression and generation varies with the size and type of the network, highlighting key limitations and potential areas for improvement.</description>

      <title>A Quantal Theory of Restoration of Strong CP Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for relaxing a gauge theory CP violating phase in discrete steps to very small values. The idea is that the CP violating phase includes the magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux which can discharge by the nucleation of membranes. Inside the bubbles surrounded by the membranes, the total CP violating phase is reduced. When the bubbles are produced rapidly during radiation domination in the early universe, near the chiral symmetry breaking scale, they will collide and percolate, melting away into gauge theory radiation and dramatically relaxing CP violation.</description>

      <title>Antinuclei from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light primordial black holes (PBHs) may have originated in the early Universe, and could contribute to the dark matter in the Universe. Their Hawking evaporation into particles could eventually lead to the production of antinuclei, which propagate and arrive at Earth as cosmic rays with a flux peaked at GeV energies. We revisit here the antiproton and antideuteron signatures from PBH evaporation, relying on a lognormal PBH mass distribution, state-of-the-art propagation models, and an improved coalescence model for fusion into antideuterons. Our predictions are then compared with AMS-02 data on the antiproton flux. We find that the AMS-02 antiproton data severely constrain the Galactic PBH density, setting bounds that depend significantly on the parameters of the lognormal mass distribution, and that are comparable to or slightly stronger than bounds set from diverse messengers. We also discuss prospects for future detection of antideuterons. Given the bounds from AMS-02 antiproton data, we predict that if antideuterons were to be measured by AMS-02 or GAPS, since the secondary contribution is subdominant, they would clearly be a signal of new physics, only part of which could, however, be explained by PBH evaporation.</description>

      <title>Improved cosmological limits on $Z^\prime$ models with light right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve limits on $Z^\prime$ extensions of the Standard Model (SM) with light right-handed neutrinos. The presence of shared gauge interactions between the light right-handed neutrinos and other SM fermions allows for production of $\nu_R$ in the early Universe and we use the excess in the effective number of neutrino species $\Delta N_\text{eff}$ to place limits. Our benchmark model is a minimal gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ that often arises as a building block in other models, and we discuss applicability to more general $U(1)$ extensions. We devise an improved Monte Carlo integration scheme convenient for implementation of generic integrated Boltzmann equations with minimal simplifying assumptions. We sketch our numerical implementation in detail for future reference. Using the new ACT DR6 limit $\Delta N_\text{eff}&lt;0.17$, we improve constraints on the gauge coupling for $1\mathrm{\,GeV} &lt; m_{Z^\prime} &lt; 100\mathrm{\,TeV}$ by orders of magnitude and find the strongest limits thus far, surpassing even current and future colliders, and explore the potential of future CMB experiments to test $U(1)$ extensions up to the GUT scale. We perform a detailed analysis of the robustness of cosmological limits within standard and non-standard thermal histories and find that a strong first order phase transition, early dark energy or early matter domination could dilute $\nu_R$ abundances beyond detection. We investigate the effect of reheating on $\nu_R$-genesis and provide results and prescriptions to apply our bounds to non-standard thermal histories. Limits are generically weakened for reheating $T_\text{reh}\ll m_{Z^\prime}$. Our results suggest that projected limits on $Z^\prime$ with Dirac neutrinos can only be accommodated for in non-standard thermal histories, thus limiting the options to include dark matter candidates or Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Relativistic Freeze-Out During Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a thorough investigation of (ultra)relativistic freeze-out (UFO) during reheating. While the standard WIMP (non-relativistic freeze-out) and FIMP (freeze-in) paradigms have been explored in detail during the reheating epoch, UFO has not been systematically studied, despite the fact that it is operative in a broad region of parameter space. Although dark matter (DM) is ``hot" at the time of relativistic freeze-out, we show that it can easily undergo enough cooling by the time of structure formation to be compatible with $\Lambda$CDM. Unlike standard WIMP-like freeze-out, there can be significant out-of-equilibrium DM production after UFO, similar to the freeze-in mechanism. However, unlike freeze-in, UFO can accommodate much stronger couplings. The UFO parameter space consistent with $\Omega_{\chi}h^2=0.12$ is quite large, with DM masses spanning about 13 orders of magnitude ($10^{-7} \text{ GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 10^{6}$ GeV), reheating temperatures spanning 17 orders of magnitude ($10^{-2} \text{ GeV} \lesssim T_{\rm RH} \lesssim 10^{15} \text{ GeV}$) and Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effective interaction scales spanning 11 orders of magnitude ($10^{3} \text{ GeV} \lesssim \Lambda \lesssim 10^{14}\text{ GeV}$). Interestingly, the most suitable range of couplings for UFO lies precisely between the typical couplings for WIMPs and FIMPs, rendering UFO quite attractive from the standpoint of detection. Particle physics models that are easily amenable to UFO include heavy vector or scalar portal interactions, along with nonrenormalizable effective interactions. Finally, we show there is a distinction between UV UFO and IR UFO, where the relic abundance for the former is sensitive to the freeze-out temperature, while the abundance for the latter is sensitive to the DM mass and the reheating temperature but insensitive to the freeze-out temperature.</description>

      <title>The third-generation-philic WIMP: an EFT analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fermionic and scalar dark matter (DM) candidates that couple predominantly to third-generation Standard Model fermions, describing their interactions within an effective field theory framework. We show that current direct-detection constraints on these interactions are more than an order of magnitude weaker than those for flavor-universal couplings: effective scales in the few-TeV range remain allowed by existing data, leaving open the possibility of a connection between this type of new physics and a solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem. Imposing the observed relic abundance from thermal freeze-out within the same effective theory, a well-defined region for a fermionic DM candidate with mass in the 1-2 TeV range emerges. Notably, this region will be fully probed by upcoming direct-detection experiments. Finally, we show that additional parameter space for both fermion and scalar cases can be recovered by going beyond the effective theory, through the introduction of a suitable vector mediator enabling resonant DM annihilation.</description>

      <title>PT2GWFinder: A Package for Cosmological First-Order Phase Transitions and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole and neutron star mergers by ground-based interferometers, as well as the evidence for a gravitational wave background from pulsar timing array experiments, has marked a new era in astrophysics and cosmology. These experiments also have great potential for discovering new physics through gravitational wave detection. One of the most motivated sources of gravitational waves that can be realized only within the beyond-the-Standard-Model framework is first-order phase transitions. In this work we release PT2GWFinder, a Mathematica package designed to compute phase transition parameters and the gravitational wave power spectrum for an arbitrary scalar theory exhibiting a first-order phase transition in a single direction. PT2GWFinder performs the phase tracing, computes the bounce profile and action using FindBounce, calculates the relevant temperatures and phase transition parameters, and finally evaluates the gravitational wave spectrum. Additionally, it offers a user-friendly interface with DRalgo, which enables the computation of the dimensionally reduced effective potential in the high-temperature regime. This work includes a user manual and two models that demonstrate the capability and performance of PT2GWFinder. As a supplement, for one of these models we obtain the bounce solution and action analytically in the thin-wall approximation and demonstrate excellent agreement with the numerical approach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Production and Baryogenesis in a Simple Left-Right model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The left-right model with the simplest Higgs structure has a $SU(2)_L$ doublet $H_L$, a $SU(2)_R$ doublet $H_R$, and a singlet $\sigma$ that couples to the doublets as $\sigma(|H_L|^2-|H_R|^2)$. The left-right symmetry has $H_L\leftrightarrow H_R$ and $\sigma\leftrightarrow-\sigma$. We study gravitational wave production and baryogenesis in the electroweak phase transitions in the model. For two benchmark points, $\sigma$ first gets a vev, followed by $H_R$ and then $H_L$. An interesting feature is that the vev of $H_L$ is initially much higher than its zero temperature value, leading to a more strongly first-order transition and higher frequency gravitational waves. An unusual benchmark point has the $\sigma$ vev at zero when the electroweak symmetry breaks. This results in both $H_L$ and $H_R$ vevs being equal and in the multi-TeV range. At a lower temperature, the $\sigma$ vev turns on, breaking the left-right symmetry and $H_L$ drops to its standard model value. Since the electroweak symmetry is broken at the multi-TeV scale, the frequency of gravitational waves will be much higher than usual. Baryogenesis is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Minimal length effect on meson form factors in light front AdS$_{5}$/QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the impact of a minimal length scale, introduced via the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), on meson form factors within light-front holographic QCD (\(\mathrm{AdS}_5 / \mathrm{QCD}\)). By incorporating GUP through deformed operators in the QCD Lagrangian, we derive a GUP-corrected light-front wave function (LFWF) that includes contributions from all Fock states, weighted by probabilities \(a_n^2\). The resulting form factors account for transitions between Fock states via coefficients \(\mathcal{C}_{nm}\), revealing a net positive \(\beta\)-like correction driven by dominant positive coefficients (e.g., \(\mathcal{C}_{04}\), \(\mathcal{C}_{12}\)). This enhancement improves agreement with experimental pion form factor data. Our model is formulated to include all Fock states via the general summation over \( n \), but numerical evaluations truncate to \( n=0, 1, 2 \), sufficient for describing experimental data up to \( Q^2 \leq 4 \, \text{GeV}^2 \). Our findings suggest that minimal length effects amplify Fock state overlaps, offering insights into the interplay between quantum gravitational corrections and strong interaction dynamics. This generalized framework advances LFH QCD by capturing multi-parton contributions and paves the way for studying GUP effects in other hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of coherent scattering on relic neutrinos boosted by cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) scattering off the cosmic relic neutrino background have recently gained renewed interest in the literature. Current data suggest that UHECR are predominantly made of heavy nuclei. Since the energy of relic neutrinos can reach $\sim O(10)$ MeV in the rest frame of the UHECR, the cross section of heavy nuclei scattering off relic neutrinos can be coherently enhanced, which is similar to the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) observed at low-energy neutrino experiments. We calculate the diffuse flux of relic neutrinos boosted by UHECR by taking into account the contributions from both the coherent and incoherent scatterings. Using current data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and the Pierre Auger Observatory, we place constraints on the overdensity of relic neutrinos down to $10^7$. Since the flux of boosted relic neutrinos peaks at an energy of $\sim O(100) \, \text{PeV}$, we also entertain the possibility to explain the recently observed KM3NeT event with boosted relic neutrinos from UHECR.</description>

      <title>A multi-process imaging of nuclear modifications on parton distributions in proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear modifications to collinear parton distribution functions are conventionally quantified by the ratios \( r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) = f^\textrm{A,proton}_i(x,Q^2) / f^\textrm{proton}_i(x,Q^2) \). For a given nucleus $A$, these ratios generally depend on the parton momentum fraction \( x \), the probing scale \( Q^{2} \), and the parton species \( i \). Determining these dependencies relies on a global analysis of diverse experimental data. However, in realistic observables, these dependencies are intricately intertwined, making their extraction challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to effectively image the nuclear modification factors \( r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) \) at the observable level in proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Specifically, through a combined study of \( Z \)-boson production, \( Z \)+jet production, and \( Z+c \)-jet production, we separately enhance signals arising from light-quark, gluon, and heavy-flavor (charm) distributions in nuclei. This enables us to effectively image the \( r^{\textrm{A}}_i(x,Q^2) \) for specific parton species. The feasibility of this method is validated through perturbative calculations at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, employing three sets of nuclear PDF parametrizations: EPPS21, nCTEQ15, and TUJU19. Future measurements of these observables are expected to provide more efficient constraints on nuclear PDFs and yield new insights into the detailed partonic structures of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Non-decoupling Higgs bosons in Spontaneous CP-Violating 2HDMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of spontaneous CP-violation in the general two Higgs doublet model, which leads to a non-decoupling structure of the Higgs sector. All the masses of the Higgs bosons are purely determined by the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs fields, and are thus constrained to be smaller than ${\cal O}(500)$ GeV by the perturbative unitarity bound. Such a non-decoupling nature predicts sizable deviations from the standard model expectations in the observables of the discovered Higgs boson ($h$). We find that the magnitude of deviations in ${\cal B}_{h \to \gamma\gamma}$ (${\cal B}_{h \to Z\gamma}$) are larger than $\sim 10\%~(4\%)$ in the Higgs alignment limit. Moreover, we show that a robust correlation emerges between the deviations in the one-loop corrected $hhh$ coupling and ${\cal B}_{h \to \gamma\gamma}$ to be, e.g., $200~(50)\%$ and $-10.3$ ($-10.8)\%$, respectively, under the constraints from theoretical bounds and current experimental data. Using a few benchmark points, we highlight that flavor-violating decays of the additional Higgs bosons can be sizable due to the constrained structure of the Yukawa interactions.</description>

      <title>Unraveling New Physics Effects in $b \rightarrow s \ell_1 \ell_2$ Transitions with a Model-Independent Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent anomalies in observables associated with flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) transitions, specifically $b \rightarrow s \ell^+ \ell^-$ processes, we present a comprehensive analysis of lepton flavor-violating (LFV) decay modes mediated by $b \rightarrow s \ell_1 \ell_2$ transitions with $\ell_1 \neq \ell_2$. While such LFV processes are forbidden within the Standard Model (SM), they naturally arise in several of its extensions, including models featuring additional vector-like fermions and extra $Z'$ bosons. Employing the most general effective Hamiltonian for $b \rightarrow s \ell_1 \ell_2$ transitions, we derive the angular distributions of the relevant decay modes. Adopting a model-independent framework, we systematically study the LFV decays $B \rightarrow K^* \ell_1 \ell_2$, $B_s \rightarrow \phi \ell_1 \ell_2$, $B \rightarrow K_2^* \ell_1 \ell_2$, and $\Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda \ell_1 \ell_2$. Although LFV mesonic decays have been widely explored, the corresponding baryonic decays remain comparatively under-investigated. We provide bounds on branching ratio ($\mathcal{B}$), forward-backward asymmetry ($\mathcal{A}_{FB}$), and longitudinal lepton polarization fraction ($\mathcal{F}_L$). Furthermore, considering the projected sensitivities of the LHCb upgrade and Belle II experiments, we estimate upper limits for these observables, offering promising avenues for probing new physics in these LFV channels.</description>

Abstract: It is generally believed that the QCD theory is the fundamental theory for strong interactions. Due to the asymptotic freedom at the short distances, after proper factorization, one can predict the value of high-energy physical observable by using the perturbative QCD (pQCD). It has been demonstrated that by recursively using of renormalization group equation with the help of Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), one can eliminate conventional renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities existed in the initial fixed-order pQCD series. To extend the predictive power of pQCD, we are still facing the problem of how to reliably estimate the contributions from the unknown higher-order (UHO) terms. In this paper, using the PMC scheme-and-scale invariant series as the starting point, we suggest a novel method of using linear regression through the origin (LRTO) to fix the asymptotic form of the pQCD series, which subsequently predicts the reasonable magnitude of the one-order higher UHO-terms. As an explicit example, we apply the method to deal with the ratio $R_\tau$, which has been calculated up to four-loop QCD corrections. Our results show that the LRTO method works well, demonstrating its reliability and significant predictive power for estimating the UHO-terms. Especially, we show that the scale-invariant and more convergent PMC series exhibits a much better predictive power with stability and reliability than the initial scale-dependent pQCD series.</description>

      <title>Probing the Collision Geometry via Two-Photon Processes in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial collision geometry, including the reaction plane, is crucial for interpreting collective phenomena in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, yet it remains experimentally inaccessible through conventional measurements. Recent studies propose utilizing photon-induced processes as a direct probe, leveraging the complete linear polarization of emitted photons whose orientation strongly correlates with the collision geometry. In this work, we employ a QED-based approach to systematically investigate dilepton production via two-photon processes in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies and detector acceptances. Our calculations reveal that dilepton emission exhibits significant sensitivity to the initial collision geometry through both the azimuthal angles of their emission (defined by the relative momentum vector of the two leptons) and the overall momentum orientation of the dilepton pairs. These findings highlight the potential of two-photon-generated dileptons as a novel, polarization-driven probe to quantify the initial collision geometry and reduce uncertainties in characterizing quark-gluon plasma properties.</description>

Abstract: We use a non-invertible symmetry to construct a three-zero texture for the down-type quark mass matrix, which can resolve the strong CP problem without invoking the axion, in four-dimensional spacetime with three quark families in QCD. We assume CP invariance at the fundamental high-energy scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out a novel mechanism to generate $\cos \phi$ two-particle azimuthal correlation (`directed flow') in unpolarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the forward rapidity region of the projectile proton. This is a direct consequence of the recently discovered strong spin-orbit coupling in gluons at small-$x$. The observable simultaneously serves as a unique probe into the double helicity parton distribution functions of the proton.</description>

      <title>Computing singlet scalar freeze-out with plasmon and plasmino states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The final-state particles from cosmological dark matter co-annihilation are expected to equilibrate. As dictated by Hard Thermal Loop resummation, the spectrum of equilibrated quasiparticles is richer than in vacuum, with a massless gauge field possessing three independent polarization states (``plasmons''), and a massless fermion developing a novel branch (``plasmino''). Furthermore, once the Higgs phenomenon sets in, vacuum and thermal mass corrections interfere. We collect together the corresponding poles and residues for the Standard Model around its crossover temperature. Choosing its singlet scalar extension for illustration, we subsequently demonstrate, both numerically and via power counting, and in accordance with general theoretical expectations, how in the freeze-out of TeV-scale dark matter, these effects remain well hidden in the inclusive annihilation cross section. In particular, the dominant (longitudinal) gauge channel is shown to be practically temperature-independent. Cosmological constraints on TeV-scale singlet scalars are reconfirmed.</description>

      <title>Effective ALP-Photon Coupling in External Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete calculation of the one-loop fermionic correction to the effective coupling between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons within a constant, homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary strength. This interaction, responsible for the Primakoff effect, is central to detecting axion-like particles in astrophysical settings and terrestrial experiments like helioscopes and haloscopes. Accurately predicting the interaction rate requires accounting for quantum corrections. Our work tackles this by employing magnetically enhanced fermion propagators derived using Schwinger's proper time method and a systematic Lorentz decomposition using the Ritus basis. We evaluate the triangle loop diagram exactly, avoiding approximations on field strength or particle kinematics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the addition to the Standard Model of a scalar $SU(2)$ multiplet $\Delta_n$ with dimension $n$ going from $1$ to $6$. The multiplet $\Delta_n$ is assumed to have null vacuum expectation value and an arbitrary (free) hypercharge. We determine the shape of the phase space for the new terms that appear in the scalar potential (SP); we observe in particular that, in the case of a 6-plet, the phase space is slightly concave along one of its boundaries. We determine the bounded-from-below and vacuum stability conditions on the SP for each value of $n$.</description>

      <title>Constituent-quark-model based coupled-channels calculation of the $\mathbf{bb\bar c\bar c}$ and $\mathbf{bc\bar b\bar c}$ tetraquark systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a coupled-channels study of the $bb\bar c\bar c$ and $bc\bar b\bar c$ tetraquark systems in a molecular approach using a constituent quark model which has been widely used to satisfactorily describe a broad range of properties of heavy quark hadron systems, either conventional or exotic. Within a molecular framework, the interaction in the heavy quark sector is governed by gluon exchange or confinement forces that are inherently color-dependent. While the $B_c B_c$ system contains two identical quarks, enabling stronger interactions via exchange diagrams, the forces in the $B_c \bar{B}_c$ and $(c\bar{c})-(b\bar{b})$ systems are expected to be significantly weaker. Consequently, the theoretical and experimental analysis of $B_c^{(*)} B_c^{(*)}$, $B_c^{(*)} \bar{B}_c^{(*)}$, and charmonium-bottomonium bound structures could play a crucial role in clarifying the dominant mechanisms responsible for the formation of fully-heavy tetraquarks. For the $bb\bar c\bar c$ tetraquark sector, we find several resonance states with different spin-parity quantum numbers. These resonances are characterized by their proximity, but not too close, to the $B_c^{(\ast)}B_c^{(\ast)}$ thresholds and their large total decay widths, indicating strong decay channels. In contrast, our analysis of the $bc\bar b\bar c$ tetraquark sector reveals no bound states, virtual states, or resonances; suggesting that tetraquark states of the $(c\bar c)-(b\bar b)$ or $B_c^{(\ast)}\bar B_c^{(\ast)}$ molecular type are unlikely to be formed, within our model assumptions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Probing Sub-GeV Leptophilic Dark Matter with the Future VLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed Very Large Area Space Telescope (VLAST), with its expected unprecedented sensitivity in the MeV-GeV range, can also address the longstanding "MeV Gap" in gamma-ray observations. We explore the capability of VLAST to detect sub-GeV leptophilic dark matter (DM) annihilation, focusing on scalar and vector mediators and emphasizing the resonance region where the mediator mass is approximately twice the DM mass. While $s$-wave annihilation is tightly constrained by relic density and cosmic microwave background observations, $p$-wave and mixed $(s+p)$-wave scenarios remain viable, particularly near resonance. Additionally, direct detection experiments, especially those probing DM-electron scattering, significantly constrain nonresonance parameter space but are less effective in the resonance regime. VLAST can uniquely probe this surviving region, outperforming existing and planned instruments, and establishing itself as a crucial tool for indirect detection of thermal relic DM.</description>

      <title>Testing an unstable cosmic neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss how different cosmological observations can test the possibility that neutrinos might be unstable on cosmological times, resulting into an unstable cosmic neutrino background. I also discuss out how actually there are different independent anomalies intriguingly hint to such a possibility that would clearly point to new physics. I first focus on how the new DESI results place an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses that starts to be in tension with the lower bound from neutrino oscillation experiments and how this tension could be easily solved assuming unstable relic neutrinos. Then I show how 21 cm cosmology allows to test radiative relic neutrino decays and how these could explain the controversial EDGES anomaly. I also discuss how the excess radio background and in particular the ARCADE 2 data can also be nicely explained by relic neutrino radiative decays. Finally, I point out the difficulties in building a model that does not clash with the upper limits on the effective magnetic moment coming from neutrino-electron scattering experiments and globular cluster stars.</description>

      <title>Primordial black-hole formation and heavy r-process element synthesis from the cosmological QCD transition. Two aspects of an inhomogeneous early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) for illuminating the dark ages of the cosmological evolution and as dark matter candidates. We elucidate the role of phase transitions for primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and focus our attention to the cosmological QCD phase transition within a recent microscopical model. We explore the impact of physics beyond the Standard Model on the cosmic equation of state and the probability distribution for the formation of primordial black holes which serve as dark matter (DM) candidates. We argue that besides primordial black holes also droplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally stabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form nuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos locally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Search with ABRACADABRA-10\,cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ABRACADABRA-10 cm has had great success as a pathfinder lumped-element axion dark matter experiment, setting limits on axion dark matter at the GUT scale. Now, using the interaction of gravitational waves with electrodynamics and a change in readout strategy, we use the ABRA-10 cm detector for the first search for high-frequency gravitational waves using a modified axion detector. Potential sources at these high frequencies (10 kHz to 5 MHz) include merging primordial black hole binaries or superradiance, among other beyond the standard model phenomena. This paper presents the design, results, and challenges from the ABRA-10 cm high-frequency gravitational wave search, showing it is possible to simultaneously look for axions and high-frequency gravitational waves with both searches matching theoretical expectations for sensitivity. Additionally, we conducted the first time series transient search with data from an axion experiment, achieving sensitivity to $10^{-4}$ in strain. Scaled directly to the next generation axion experiment, DMRadio-GUT, this sensitivity would imply a reach to 0.01 $M_{\odot}$ primordial black hole mergers at distances around 3 pc, with prospects to go significantly further with modifications to the readout.</description>

      <title>Tidal effects on primordial black hole capture in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the capture of a primordial black hole (PBH) by a neutron star, accounting for the tidal perturbation from a nearby star or planet. For asteroid-mass PBHs, which could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe, a weakly bound post-capture orbit could be tidally disturbed to the point of preventing the PBH from settling in the neutron star and consuming it within a cosmologically short timescale. We show how this effect depends on environmental parameters and can weaken the proposed constraints based on observations of old neutron stars in high-density dark matter environments for PBH masses $\lesssim 10^{22}\,$g. We also provide approximate analytical formulae for the capture rates.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional femtoscopy for proton pairs in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtoscopy, a technique of measuring the size and the dynamics of the system created in heavy-ion collisions is used extensively in experiments at RHIC, LHC, SPS, and the FAIR/GSI. Analysis for pairs of pions is most common, due to their large abundance in the collisions, as well as well-understood theoretical formalism and advanced experimental methodology. It is usually performed in three dimensions in longitudinally co-moving reference frame of the pair, to maximize the amount of information obtained about the source. Similar three-dimensional analysis has also been performed for charged and neutral kaons. In contrast analyses for all other pair types -- either for pairs of identical protons, or for pairs of non-identical particles are only one-dimensional. The abundance of heavier particles is lower than for pions, while the theoretical formalism for such correlations, as well as practical experimental methodology is limited to one-dimensional case up to now. This work identifies specific challenges arising in the analysis of three-dimensional proton-proton femtoscopy and proposes a theoretical formalism to analyze them, as well as specific experimental methods to extract and fit correlations. A test and validation of these methods is performed on correlations simulated in the LHyquid+Therminator2 model, and demonstrates the feasibility of such analysis. The caveats in the theoretical interpretation of the results are discussed, by comparing the fitted values of femtscopic radii with the true characteristics of the source extracted directly from the model.</description>

      <title>Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as ultra-long period objects after a dormant cooling epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-long period transients (ULPs) are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for isolated ULPs, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$~hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as Galactic ULPs may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <title>Manifest Gauge Invariance for Structure Dependent Radiative Corrections to Processes Involving Atoms and Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections to reactions involving atoms or nuclei can become sensitive to the structure of the bound state. Generically, one encounters correlation functions of multiple currents which must satisfy Ward identities. At intermediate steps, however the Ward identities are obscured, and often violated by physically motivated approximation schemes. In this paper we outline a method to construct a representation of the aforementioned correlators that manifests gauge invariance in the limit of a heavy target (i.e., when recoil energy can be neglected). This representation then enables manifestly gauge invariant approximation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed representation naturally separates the largest contributions that dominate scattering amplitudes in the limit of a heavy constituent (e.g., proton) mass. We analyze elastic electron scattering from nuclei in detail, and also discuss radiative corrections to processes mediated by the weak interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of multi-field Dark Energy, using a well-motivated axio-dilaton model that contains the minimal number of fields to have the 2-derivative sigma-model interactions that power-counting arguments show naturally compete with General Relativity at low energies. Our analysis differs from earlier, related, studies by treating the case where the dilaton's couplings to matter are large enough to require screening to avoid unacceptable dilaton-mediated forces in the solar system. We use a recently proposed screening mechanism that exploits the interplay between stronger-than-gravitational axion-matter couplings with the 2-derivative axion-dilaton interactions to suppress the couplings of the dilaton to bulk matter. The required axion-matter couplings also modify cosmology, with the axion's background energy density turning out to resemble early dark energy. We compute the properties of the axion fluid describing the rapid oscillations of the axion field around the time-dependent minimum of its matter-dependent effective potential, extending the usual formalism to include nontrivial kinetic sigma-model interactions. We explore the implications of these models for the Cosmic Microwave Background and the growth of structure and find that for dilaton potentials of the Albrecht-Skordis form (itself well-motivated by UV physics), successful screening can be consistent with the early dark energy temporarily comprising as much as 10% of the total density in the past. We find that increasing the dilaton-matter coupling decreases the growth of structure due to enhanced Hubble friction, an effect that dominates the usual fifth-force effects that amplify structure growth.</description>

      <title>Comparison of integral equations used to study $T_{cc}^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed comparison between three formalisms used in recent studies of $DD^*$ scattering, which aim to understand the properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark, $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. These methods are the three-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials, and the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen (BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing that differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting short-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1804.05073v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy levels of the $n=1$ and $n=2$ bound states of the $\mu^+\mu^-$ atom (true muonium) are calculated starting from a previously derived potential that correctly describes positronium to order $\alpha^5$ supplemented by the known $\alpha^6$ contributions. All electron vacuum polarization corrections on the true muonium levels are computed to order $\alpha^6$ order. The second order perturbative contributions from all of the $\alpha^4$ and $\alpha^5$ terms in the potential are also included. Additional order $\alpha^6$ contributions from the two photon and three photon annihilation processes are included in the evaluation of the ground state ($1^3S_1-1^1S_0$) hyperfine splitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a possible attempt at renormalisable quantum gravity based on the standard BRST quantisation used for Yang-Mills theory. We have provided the BRST invariant Lagrangian of the gravitationally interacting U(1) gauge theory, namely the Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics (QGED), including the gauge fixing and the ghost Lagrangian. We have extracted a set of Feynman rules in the local inertial frame where gravity locally vanishes from this Lagrangian. Using the Feynman rules of the QGED constructed here, we have built all the renormalisation constants and show that the theory is perturbatively renormalisable, at least in the one-loop order. Power counting suggests that our theory could be renormalised in all orders of perturbative expansion. All infinite naked objects in the naked Lagrangian can replace experimentally measured ones. In addition to the standard QED parameters, we have shown that the gravitational coupling constant can be experimentally measured.
  We have also discussed a running effect of the gravitational coupling constant and the perturbative estimation of the Hawking radiation as examples of perturbative QGED. The difference between our theory and the widely known un-renormalisable quantum general relativity is clarified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of Dark Matter (DM) fermions production alongside a gauge boson (A$^{\prime}$) using a model based on Einstein-Cartan gravity in an electron-positron linear collider, such as the ILC, that operates at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV with a detector's integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$. We used the WHIZARD package as the event generator to simulate the $ e^{+} e^{-}$ interactions that lead to the production of di-muon pairs and missing transverse energy. We specifically are performing this study on a low mass dark gauge boson, M$_{A^\prime}$= 10 GeV, that can subsequently decay into a muon pair (A$^\prime\rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-})$ while aiming to set upper limits on the free parameters' masses of the model, such as the torsion field (ST), if evidence for physics beyond the standard model is not found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scenarios for secluded WIMP dark matter models have been extensively studied in simplified versions. This paper shows a complete UV realization of a secluded WIMP dark matter model with an extra Abelian gauge symmetry that includes two-component dark matter candidates, where the dark matter conversion process plays a significant role in determining the relic density in the Universe. The model contains two new unstable mediators: a dark Higgs and a dark photon. It generates Dirac neutrino masses and can be tested in future direct detection experiments of dark matter. The model is also compatible with cosmological and theoretical constraints, including the branching ratio of Standard model particles into invisible, Big Bang nucleosynthesis restrictions, and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, even without kinetic mixing.</description>

      <title>Valence quark-stopping and gluon junction-stopping scenarios in electron-nucleus collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider: Which one is correct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the current literature, two stopping scenarios are being discussed in the context of high-energy collisions: the valence quark scenario and the gluon or baryon junction scenario. In the valence quark-stopping scenario, three valence quarks each contribute one-third of the baryon number within a baryon. Conversely, in the gluon junction-stopping scenario, the gluon junction is responsible for carrying the entire baryon number. At present, there is no consensus regarding which type of stopping scenario is correct. Based on a multi-source thermal model, our investigation indicates that experimental data analyzed in previous and present studies suggest that the valence quark-stopping scenario is indeed accurate. It is anticipated that this scenario can be further validated through electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Constraints on extended axion structures from the lensing of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that have been regarded as promising dark matter (DM) candidates. On the other hand, extended compact objects such as axion stars, which are supported by gravity and axion self interactions, may have also been formed in the early Universe and comprise part of DM. In this work, we consider the lensing of electromagnetic signals from distant sources by axion stars, as a way to constrain the properties of axion stars and fundamental axion parameters. Accounting for the effect of the finite size of the axion star, we study the lensing effect induced by gravity, and by axion-photon interactions. The latter effect is frequency dependent, and is relevant in the low frequency band, which motivates the use of fast radio burst (FRB) signals as a probe. We calculate the predicted number of lensed FRB events by specifying the fundamental axion parameters, axion star radial profile, fraction of DM residing in axion stars, and imposing lensing criteria based on the flux ratio and time delay between the brightest images from lensing. Assuming an optimistic case of $10^4$ observed FRB events, and a timing resolution of $1\,\mu{\rm s}$, the lack of observed FRB lensing events in CHIME allows us to probe axion stars with mass $ \gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\odot$, corresponding to axion masses $\lesssim 10^{-10}\,{\rm eV}$ and for negligible axion-photon couplings. Even lighter axion stars up to $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot$ can be probed, assuming axion-photon couplings of at least $10^{-6}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Our results indicate that while FRB lensing by axion stars lead to sensitivities that are competitive with conventional microlensing searches operating in the optical band, it remains a challenge to probe axion-photon induced lensing effects.</description>

      <title>Spectral diversity in collisional neutrino-flavor conversion: flavor equipartition or swap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum kinetics of neutrinos are known to potentially change the classical neutrino radiation field in high-energy astrophysical sources such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. However, the mixing phenomena still have open issues in the nonlinear dynamics and the asymptotic states, particularly for recently discovered collision-induced flavor conversion. In this paper, we investigate linear and nonlinear dynamics of collisional neutrino-flavor conversion (CFC) with multi-energy neutrino gases through numerical simulations, demonstrating that the asymptotic states dramatically change depending on unstable modes dominating the system. In one unstable mode, high-energy neutrinos reach a flavor equipartition, but low-energy neutrinos return back to almost their initial states. In contrast, in the other one, rather low-energy neutrinos achieve a full flavor swap, but high-energy neutrinos undergo less flavor conversion. We clarify the distinct spectral behaviors in two different ways based on stability analysis and flavor pendulum. Our result suggests that CFC with flavor swap can become crucial at deeper radii with low electron fraction and requires more detailed theoretical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics.</description>

      <title>Superkick Effect in Vortex Particle Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex states of photons or electrons are a novel and promising experimental tool across atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. Various experimental schemes to generate high-energy vortex particles have been proposed. However, diagnosing the characteristics of vortex states at high energies remains a significant challenge, as traditional low-energy detection schemes become impractical for high-energy vortex particles due to their extremely short de Broglie wavelength. We recently proposed a novel experimental detection scheme based on a mechanism called "superkick" that is free from many drawbacks of the traditional methods and can reveal the vortex phase characteristics. In this paper, we present a complete theoretical framework for calculating the superkick effect in elastic electron scattering and systematically investigate the impact of various factors on its visibility. In particular, we argue that the vortex phase can be identified either by detecting the two scattered electrons in coincidence or by analyzing the characteristic azimuthal asymmetry in individual final particles.</description>

Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark-gluon plasma around the critical point at $T=182$ MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.15. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <title>The History of Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05736v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We overview the history of primordial black hole (PBH) research from the first papers around 50 years ago to the present epoch. The history may be divided into four periods, the dividing lines being marked by three key developments: inflation on the theoretical front and the detection of microlensing events by the MACHO project and gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA project on the observation front. However, they are also characterised by somewhat different focuses of research. The period 1967-1980 covered the groundbreaking work on PBH formation and evaporation. The period 1980-1996 mainly focussed on their formation, while the period 1996-2016 consolidated the work on formation but also collated the constraints on the PBH abundance. In the period 2016-2024 there was a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs and - while opinions about the strength of the purported evidence vary - this has motivated more careful studies of some aspects of the subject. Certainly the soaring number of papers on PBHs in this last period indicates a growing interest in the topic.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20009v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix and using a bootstrap generalization of the Cullum-Willoughby method to filter out spurious eigenvalues. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than the "effective mass," which is related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties.</description>

The rich and uniquely clean data set of charm mesons and baryons at BESIII offers a unique laboratory to study the evolution of Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) parameters across different charm hadron species and to shed light on the interplay between heavy quark dynamics and light quark effects. The HQE in terms of inverse powers of the heavy meson mass is well-established in beauty decays, however due to the lighter charm mass its applicability to charm remains an open question. To date no determination of the HQE parameters, the kinetic energy, chromomagnetic moment and Darwin terms, has been attempted. A particularly important role here is given to the Darwin and weak annihilation operators, whose values are important to predict lifetimes of heavy hadrons. Using a fast simulation for the BESIII detector response and predictions for spectral moments, we investigate the sensitivity to HQE parameters with today's and possible future data sets. In addition, we discuss the theory challenges for the HQE in charm and the experimental limitations. We further investigate the sensitivity of determining the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ with inclusive semileptonic charm decays.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity may govern the unification of all known elementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the internal $SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a consistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $% SL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus maintaining their connection to gravity. As a result -- while the full gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector and tensor field submultiplets of $SU(N)$ -- only the vector submultiplet and singlet tensor field may manifest in an observed particle spectrum. The axial-vector submultiplet remains decoupled from ordinary matter, while the tensor submultiplet acquires the Planck scale order mass. Consequently, the effective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$, bringing together $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states in $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin magnitudes, some $% SU(N)$ grand unified models, including the standard $SU(5)$, appear unsuitable for the standard spin-$1/2$ quarks and leptons. However, applying $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons form the fundamental representations, identifies $% SL(16,C)$ with its effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing fundamental forces.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory-burdened black holes on primordial gravitational waves in light of Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue-tilted Gravitational Waves (BGWs) have been proposed as a potential candidate for the cosmic gravitational waves detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). In the standard cosmological framework, BGWs are constrained in their frequency range by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limit on GW amplitude, which precludes their detection at interferometer scales. However, introducing a phase of early matter domination dilutes BGWs at higher frequencies, ensuring compatibility with both the BBN and LIGO constraints on stochastic GWs. This mechanism allows BGWs to align with PTA data while producing a distinct and testable GW signal across a broad frequency spectrum. Ultralight Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could provide the required early matter-dominated phase to support this process. Interpreted through the lens of BGWs, the PTA results offer a way to constrain the parameter space of a new scenario involving modified Hawking radiation, known as the ``memory burden" effect, associated with ultralight PBHs. This interpretation can be further probed by high-frequency GW detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate that PBHs as light as $10^{2-3}~{\rm g}$ can leave detectable imprints on BGWs at higher frequencies while remaining consistent with PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion-like particles with SPHEREx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study prospects to detect axion-like particles (ALPs) with the upcoming near-infrared telescope SPHEREx. The signal under investigation is the ALP decay into two photons. Assuming dark matter (DM) to be in the form of ALPs, we analyze the signal from the DM halos of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way. We find that SPHEREx can significantly improve current limits on the axion-photon coupling in the 0.5-3 eV ALP mass range.</description>

      <title>Entropy correction and quasinormal modes of slowly rotating Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like black hole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tunneling of fermion particle for slowly rotating Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like (KNdS-like) black hole in bumblebee gravity model by applying the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The Hawking temperature of slowly rotating KNdS-like black hole has been modified under GUP. The quantum gravity effect reduces the rise of Hawking temperature of slowly rotating KNdS-like black hole. The modified Hawking temperature and the correction of black hole entropy are investigated by using the tunneling of fermion beyond the semiclassical approximation. We study the scalar field perturbation and effective potential of slowly rotating KNdS-like black hole in bumblebee gravity model by using Klein-G\"{o}rdon equation. The quasinormal modes for scalar perturbation is investigated using WKB approximation method and P{\"o}schl-Teller fitting method. The significant impact on the greybody factor, Hawking spectra and sparsity of Hawking radiation of the black hole are also studied in the presence of Lorentz violating parameter L.</description>

      <title>Electroweak form factors of baryons in dense nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is evidence that the properties of hadrons are modified in a nuclear medium. Information about the medium modifications of the internal structure of hadrons is fundamental for the study of dense nuclear matter and high-energy processes, including heavy-ion and nucleus--nucleus collisions. At the moment, however, empirical information about medium modifications of hadrons is limited; therefore, theoretical studies are essential for progress in the field. In the present work, we review theoretical studies of the electromagnetic and axial form factors of octet baryons in symmetric nuclear matter. The calculations are based on a model that takes into account the degrees of freedom revealed in experimental studies of low and intermediate square transfer momentum $q^2=-Q^2$: valence quarks and meson cloud excitations of baryon cores. The formalism combines a covariant constituent quark model, developed for a free space (vacuum) with the quark--meson coupling model for extension to the nuclear medium. We conclude that the nuclear medium modifies the baryon properties differently according to the flavor content of the baryons and the medium density. The effects of the medium increase with density and are stronger (quenched or enhanced) for light baryons than for heavy baryons. In particular, the in-medium neutrino--nucleon and antineutrino--nucleon cross-sections are reduced compared to the values in free space. The proposed formalism can be extended to densities above the normal nuclear density and applied to neutrino--hyperon and antineutrino--hyperon scattering in dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Energy or Evolving Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the latest empirical constraints on cosmology, from a combination of DESI, CMB and supernova data, can be accounted for if a small component of dark matter has an evolving and oscillating equation of state within $-1&lt;w&lt;1$. From a fundamental physics perspective, this interpretation is more appealing than an evolving phantom dark energy with $w&lt;-1$, which violates the null energy condition.</description>
