      <title>Elucidating microstructural influences on fatigue behavior for additively manufactured Hastelloy X using Bayesian-calibrated crystal plasticity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal plasticity (CP) modeling is a vital tool for predicting the mechanical behavior of materials, but its calibration involves numerous (&gt;8) constitutive parameters, often requiring time-consuming trial-and-error methods. This paper proposes a robust calibration approach using Bayesian optimization (BO) to identify optimal CP model parameters under fatigue loading conditions. Utilizing cyclic data from additively manufactured Hastelloy X specimens at 500 degree-F, the BO framework, integrated with a Gaussian process surrogate model, significantly reduces the number of required simulations. A novel objective function is developed to match experimental stress-strain data across different strain amplitudes. Results demonstrate that effective CP model calibration is achieved within 75 iterations, with as few as 50 initial simulations. Sensitivity analysis reveals the influence of CP parameters at various loading points on the stress-strain curve. The results show that the stress-strain response is predominantly controlled by parameters related to yield, with increased influence from backstress parameters during compressive loading. In addition, the effect of introducing twins into the synthetic microstructure on fatigue behavior is studied, and a relationship between microstructural features and the fatigue indicator parameter is established. Results show that larger diameter grains, which exhibit a higher Schmid factor and an average misorientation of approximately 42 degrees +/- 1.67 degree, are identified as probable sites for failure. The proposed optimization framework can be applied to any material system or CP model, streamlining the calibration process and improving the predictive accuracy of such models.</description>

      <title>Is Polarization an Inevitable Outcome of Similarity-Based Content Recommendations? -- Mathematical Proofs and Computational Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on digital platforms shapes how individuals understand the world, as recommendation systems direct users toward content "similar" to their existing preferences. While this process simplifies information retrieval, there is concern that it may foster insular communities, so-called echo chambers, reinforcing existing viewpoints and limiting exposure to alternatives. To investigate whether such polarization emerges from fundamental principles of recommendation systems, we propose a minimal model that represents users and content as points in a continuous space. Users iteratively move toward the median of locally recommended items, chosen by nearest-neighbor criteria, and we show mathematically that they naturally coalesce into distinct, stable clusters without any explicit ideological bias. Computational simulations confirm these findings and explore how population size, adaptation rates, content production probabilities, and noise levels modulate clustering speed and intensity. Our results suggest that similarity-based retrieval, even in simplified scenarios, drives fragmentation. While we do not claim all systems inevitably cause polarization, we highlight that such retrieval is not neutral. Recognizing the geometric underpinnings of recommendation spaces may inform interventions, policies, and critiques that address unintended cultural and ideological divisions.</description>

      <title>On Scalable Design for User-Centric Multi-Modal Shared E-Mobility Systems using MILP and Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of urban transportation, shared e-mobility services have emerged as a sustainable solution to meet growing demand for flexible, eco-friendly travel. However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive multi-modal optimization framework with focus on user preferences and real-world constraints. This paper presents a multi-modal optimization framework for shared e-mobility, with a particular focus on e-mobility hubs (e-hubs) with micromobility. We propose and evaluate two approaches: a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solution, complemented by a heuristic graph reduction technique to manage computational complexity in scenarios with limited e-hubs, achieving a computational advantage of 93%, 72%, and 47% for 20, 50, and 100 e-hubs, respectively. Additionally, the modified Dijkstra's algorithm offers a more scalable, real-time alternative for larger e-hub networks, with median execution times consistently around 53 ms, regardless of the number of e-hubs. Thorough experimental evaluation on real-world map and simulated traffic data of Dublin City Centre reveals that both methods seamlessly adapt to practical considerations and constraints such as multi-modality, user-preferences and state of charge for different e-mobility tools. While MILP offers greater flexibility for incorporating additional objectives and constraints, the modified Dijkstra's algorithm is better suited for large-scale, real-time applications due to its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Report on Financial Regulations Challenge at COLING 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial large language models (FinLLMs) have been applied to various tasks in business, finance, accounting, and auditing. Complex financial regulations and standards are critical to financial services, which LLMs must comply with. However, FinLLMs' performance in understanding and interpreting financial regulations has rarely been studied. Therefore, we organize the Regulations Challenge, a shared task at COLING 2025. It encourages the academic community to explore the strengths and limitations of popular LLMs. We create 9 novel tasks and corresponding question sets. In this paper, we provide an overview of these tasks and summarize participants' approaches and results. We aim to raise awareness of FinLLMs' professional capability in financial regulations.</description>

      <title>Cardiovascular Disease Detection By Leveraging Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) persists as a primary cause of death on a global scale, which requires more effective and timely detection methods. Traditional supervised learning approaches for CVD detection rely heavily on large-labeled datasets, which are often difficult to obtain. This paper employs semi-supervised learning models to boost efficiency and accuracy of CVD detection when there are few labeled samples. By leveraging both labeled and vast amounts of unlabeled data, our approach demonstrates improvements in prediction performance, while reducing the dependency on labeled data. Experimental results in a publicly available dataset show that semi-supervised models outperform traditional supervised learning techniques, providing an intriguing approach for the initial identification of cardiovascular disease within clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Method for Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification is crucial for space safety and satellite monitoring, involving the analysis of typical satellite behaviors such as station-keeping, drift, etc. However, existing PoL identification methods remain underdeveloped due to the complexity of aerospace systems, variability in satellite behaviors, and fluctuating observation sampling rates. In a first attempt, we developed a domain expertise-informed machine learning method (Expert-ML) to combine satellite orbital movement knowledge and machine learning models. The Expert-ML method achieved high accuracy results in simulation data and real-world data with normal sampling rate. However, this approach lacks of generality as it requires domain expertise and its performance degraded significantly when data sampling rate varied. To achieve generality, we propose a novel diffusion-based PoL identification method. Distinct from prior approaches, the proposed method leverages a diffusion model to achieve end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, we employ a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data. The encoded features are subsequently incorporated as conditional information in the denoising process to generate PoL labels. Through experimentation across real-world satellite settings, our proposed diffusion-based method demonstrates its high identification quality and provides a robust solution even with reduced data sampling rates, indicating its great potential in practical satellite behavior pattern identification, tracking and related mission deployment.</description>

      <title>SusGen-GPT: A Data-Centric LLM for Financial NLP and Sustainability Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the financial sector and the rising focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations highlight the need for advanced NLP tools. However, open-source LLMs proficient in both finance and ESG domains remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce SusGen-30K, a category-balanced dataset comprising seven financial NLP tasks and ESG report generation, and propose TCFD-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating sustainability report generation. Leveraging this dataset, we developed SusGen-GPT, a suite of models achieving state-of-the-art performance across six adapted and two off-the-shelf tasks, trailing GPT-4 by only 2% despite using 7-8B parameters compared to GPT-4's 1,700B. Based on this, we propose the SusGen system, integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to assist in sustainability report generation. This work demonstrates the efficiency of our approach, advancing research in finance and ESG.</description>

      <title>Populating cellular metamaterials on the extrema of attainable elasticity through neuroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative and entropy stable solid wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for imposing non-linear entropy conservative and entropy stable wall boundary conditions for the resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of an adiabatic wall or a wall with a prescribed heat entropy flow, addressing three scenarios: electrically insulating walls, thin walls with finite conductivity, and perfectly conducting walls. The procedure relies on the formalism and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts, and simultaneous-approximation-term operators. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of boundary conditions is coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable discrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are weakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a simultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation operators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators) on high-order unstructured grids are used to demonstrate the new procedure's accuracy, robustness, and efficacy for weakly enforcing boundary conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the non-linear stability of the proposed technique, with applications to three-dimensional flows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm summation-by-parts spatial operator, including finite element, finite difference, finite volume, nodal and modal discontinuous Galerkin, and flux reconstruction schemes.</description>

      <title>Practical IMT and EESS Spectrum Sharing in the 7 to 8 GHz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 7.3 GHz (350 MHz bandwidth) Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) band, while not protected, is used for Passive Sea Surface Temperature (P-SST) measurements that provide important data for weather forecasts, coastal disaster prevention, climate modeling, and oceanographic research. The full 7 GHz band (7.125 to 8.4 GHz), which encompasses these EOS frequencies, is the largest contiguous block of potentially available mid-band spectrum and will play a significant role in meeting the anticipated demand for wireless services. A Real Time Geofenced Spectrum Sharing (RGSS) system is shown to be a practical and near term solution to spectrum sharing between P-SST measurements and 5G or 6G networks in the 7GHz band. RGSS enables IMT networks and EOS radiometers to share 350MHz of overlapping spectrum centered at 7.3 GHz. It prevents interference to P-SST measurements while simultaneously allowing IMT systems un-constrained access to the shared spectrum greater than 99.9% of the time. Subscriber impact during the less than 0.1 percent paused access time can be prevented by using 3GPP defined capabilities and O-RAN APIs to move subscribers to other frequencies. Paused access time data from a proof-of-concept RGSS system is available to academic, government, and industry researchers through a web or programmatic interface.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Enhanced Monte Carlo: A Machine Learning View on Control Variate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being an essential tool across engineering and finance, Monte Carlo simulation can be computationally intensive, especially in large-scale, path-dependent problems that hinder straightforward parallelization. A natural alternative is to replace simulation with machine learning or surrogate prediction, though this introduces challenges in understanding the resulting errors.We introduce a Prediction-Enhanced Monte Carlo (PEMC) framework where we leverage machine learning prediction as control variates, thus maintaining unbiased evaluations instead of the direct use of ML predictors. Traditional control variate methods require knowledge of means and focus on per-sample variance reduction. In contrast, PEMC aims at overall cost-aware variance reduction, eliminating the need for mean knowledge. PEMC leverages pre-trained neural architectures to construct effective control variates and replaces computationally expensive sample-path generation with efficient neural network evaluations. This allows PEMC to address scenarios where no good control variates are known. We showcase the efficacy of PEMC through two production-grade exotic option-pricing problems: swaption pricing in HJM model and the variance swap pricing in a stochastic local volatility model.</description>

      <title>An adaptive acceleration scheme for phase-field fatigue computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-field models of fatigue are capable of reproducing the main phenomenology of fatigue behavior. However, phase-field computations in the high-cycle fatigue regime are prohibitively expensive, due to the need to resolve spatially the small length scale inherent to phase-field models and temporally the loading history for several millions of cycles. As a remedy, we propose a fully adaptive acceleration scheme based on the cycle jump technique, where the cycle-by-cycle resolution of an appropriately determined number of cycles is skipped while predicting the local system evolution during the jump. The novelty of our approach is a cycle-jump criterion to determine the appropriate cycle-jump size based on a target increment of a global variable which monitors the advancement of fatigue. We propose the definition and meaning of this variable for three general stages of the fatigue life. In comparison to existing acceleration techniques, our approach needs no parameters and bounds for the cycle-jump size, and it works independently of the material, specimen or loading conditions. Since one of the monitoring variables is the fatigue crack length, we introduce an accurate, flexible and efficient method for its computation, which overcomes the issues of conventional crack tip tracking algorithms and enables the consideration of several cracks evolving at the same time. The performance of the proposed acceleration scheme is demonstrated with representative numerical examples, which show a speedup reaching four orders of magnitude in the high-cycle fatigue regime with consistently high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Calibration and Validation of a Phase-Field Model of Brittle Fracture within the Damage Mechanics Challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the Damage Mechanics Challenge, we adopt a phase-field model of brittle fracture to blindly predict the behavior up to failure of a notched three-point-bending specimen loaded under mixed-mode conditions. The beam is additively manufactured using a geo-architected gypsum based on the combination of bassanite and a water-based binder. The calibration of the material parameters involved in the model is based on a set of available independent experimental tests and on a two-stage procedure. In the first stage an estimate of most of the elastic parameters is obtained, whereas the remaining parameters are optimized in the second stage so as to minimize the discrepancy between the numerical predictions and a set of experimental results on notched three-point-bending beams. The good agreement between numerical predictions and experimental results in terms of load-displacement curves and crack paths demonstrates the predictive ability of the model and the reliability of the calibration procedure.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at \url{https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN}.</description>

      <title>SocialEyes: Scaling mobile eye-tracking to multi-person social settings</title>

Abstract: Eye movements provide a window into human behaviour, attention, and interaction dynamics. Challenges in real-world, multi-person environments have, however, restrained eye-tracking research predominantly to single-person, in-lab settings. We developed a system to stream, record, and analyse synchronised data from multiple mobile eye-tracking devices during collective viewing experiences (e.g., concerts, films, lectures). We implemented lightweight operator interfaces for real-time-monitoring, remote-troubleshooting, and gaze-projection from individual egocentric perspectives to a common coordinate space for shared gaze analysis. We tested the system in a live concert and a film screening with 30 simultaneous viewers during each of two public events (N=60). We observe precise time-synchronisation between devices measured through recorded clock-offsets, and accurate gaze-projection in challenging dynamic scenes. Our novel analysis metrics and visualizations illustrate the potential of collective eye-tracking data for understanding collaborative behaviour and social interaction. This advancement promotes ecological validity in eye-tracking research and paves the way for innovative interactive tools.</description>

      <title>Multistep Brent Oil Price Forecasting with a Multi-Aspect Meta-heuristic Optimization and Ensemble Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate crude oil price forecasting is crucial for various economic activities, including energy trading, risk management, and investment planning. Although deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for crude oil price forecasting, achieving accurate forecasts remains challenging. Deep learning models' performance is heavily influenced by hyperparameters tuning, and they are expected to perform differently under various circumstances. Furthermore, price volatility is also sensitive to external factors such as world events. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates metaheuristic optimization with an ensemble of five widely used neural network architectures for time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that apply metaheuristics to optimise hyperparameters within the neural network architecture, we exploit the GWO metaheuristic optimiser at four levels: feature selection, data preparation, model training, and forecast blending. The proposed approach has been evaluated for forecasting three-ahead days using real-world Brent crude oil price data, and the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the forecasting performance measured using various benchmarks, achieving 0.000127 of MSE.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multimodal Protein Representations to Predict Protein Melting Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting protein melting temperature changes (Delta Tm) is fundamental for assessing protein stability and guiding protein engineering. Leveraging multi-modal protein representations has shown great promise in capturing the complex relationships among protein sequences, structures, and functions. In this study, we develop models based on powerful protein language models, including ESM-2, ESM-3 and AlphaFold, using various feature extraction methods to enhance prediction accuracy. By utilizing the ESM-3 model, we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the s571 test dataset, obtaining a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.50. Furthermore, we conduct a fair evaluation to compare the performance of different protein language models in the Delta Tm prediction task. Our results demonstrate that integrating multi-modal protein representations could advance the prediction of protein melting temperatures.</description>

      <title>Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.
