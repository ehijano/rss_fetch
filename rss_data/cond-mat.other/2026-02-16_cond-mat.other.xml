      <title>Enhanced Spin Lifetime and Long-Range Spin Transport in p-Silicon using Spin Gapless Semiconductor as Ferromagnetic Injector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical spin injection and transport in silicon are central challenges for realizing semiconductor-based spintronic devices, particularly in p-type Si, where strong spin relaxation and interface effects often suppress detectable spin signals. Here, we report electrical spin injection, accumulation, and transport in lightly doped p-type silicon using the spin-gapless Heusler compound Mn$_2$CoAl as a ferromagnetic spin injector, separated from the p-Si channel by a thin MgO tunnel barrier in a lateral device geometry. Spin transport is systematically investigated through three-terminal (3-T) Hanle and four-terminal (4-T) nonlocal (NL) spin-valve and Hanle measurements. Clear Lorentzian Hanle signals are observed in the 3-T configuration from \SI{5}{K} up to room temperature, yielding a spin lifetime of approximately $\sim$\SI{0.68}{ns} at \SI{300}{K} that increases to approximately $\sim$\SI{4.11}{ns} at \SI{5}{K}. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals a weak power-law dependence of the spin lifetime, indicating a Bir--Aronov--Pikus-type spin relaxation mechanism. To validate genuine spin transport, NL spin-valve and Hanle measurements were performed, revealing well-defined spin-valve switching and controlled spin precession at \SI{5}{K}. From NL Hanle fitting, a spin lifetime of approximately $\sim$\SI{5.65}{ns} and a spin diffusion length of approximately $\sim$\SI{0.82}{\micro\meter} are extracted, confirming diffusive long-range spin transport in the p-Si channel. Although NL signals diminish at elevated temperatures due to reduced interfacial spin polarization and thermal noise, the combined 3-T and 4-T results establish spin-gapless Mn$_2$CoAl as an effective spin injector for p-type silicon. These findings highlight the potential of spin-gapless semiconductors for improving spin injection efficiency and advancing Si-compatible spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Compact localized states and magnetic flux-driven topological phase transition in a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a novel two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model defined on a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry that hosts multiple flat bands (FBs) and supports topological phase transitions driven by a magnetic flux. This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology with partially accessible chaotic sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most quantum metrology protocols harness highly entangled probe states and globally accessible measurements to surpass the standard quantum limit. However, it is challenging to satisfy these requirements in realistic many-body sensors. We demonstrate that both of these constraints can be overcome in quantum chaotic sensors. Crucially, we establish that even in the presence of partial measurement accessibility, chaotic dynamics enables initial unentangled states to exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information, $I_{\alpha}$ with time. In the weakly chaotic regime, we identify spin-coherent states placed at the edge of the regular islands in the mixed classical phase space as optimal initial states for enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, in the strongly chaotic regime, $I_{\alpha}$ is insensitive to the choice of the initial state. Notably, quantum-enhanced sensitivity is achieved even when a very low fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the qubits are accessible. These results establish quantum chaos as a robust resource for quantum-enhanced sensing under realistic accessibility constraints on accessibility.</description>

      <title>Stability of stationary solutions in Acoustic wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of steady-state solutions of the Wave-Kinetic Equations for acoustic waves. Combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we characterise the time evolution of small isotropic perturbations for both 2D and 3D equilibrium Rayleigh-Jeans and non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov solutions. In particular, we show that the stability of these solutions is ensured by different mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between bodies integrated in a microelectromechanical/nanoelectromechanical quantum damped oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due to its dependence on various circuit elements.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian interference of topological edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological boundary states exhibit distinctive properties, including unidirectional propagation and noise robustness, which hold significant potential for advancing the performance of quantum science and technology. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of non-Abelian quantum interference and entanglement generation, protected by dual symmetries (time-independent inversion and time-dependent interchain), in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Specifically, in a multichain system, we first achieve tunable topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is selected by the permutation sequence. We then extend this to two particles, observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially entangled NOON states whose properties are dictated by the permutation sequence. Our work establishes an alternative pathway for exploring non-Abelian topology applied to quantum science and technology, enabled by the unique protection of time-dependent symmetry.</description>
