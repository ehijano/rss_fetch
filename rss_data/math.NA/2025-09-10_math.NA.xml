      <title>Subdivision Schemes in Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for nonlinear subdivision schemes on complete metric spaces (CMS). We begin with CMS preliminaries and formalize refinement in CMS, retaining key structural properties, such as locality. We prove a convergence theorem under contractivity and demonstrate its applicability. To address schemes where contractivity is unknown, we introduce two notions of proximity. Our proximity methods relate a nonlinear scheme to another nonlinear scheme with known contractivity, rather than to a linear scheme, as in much of the literature. Specifically, the first type proximity compares the two schemes after a single refinement step and, as in the classical theory, yields convergence from sufficiently dense initial data. The proximity of the second type monitors alignment across all refinement levels and provides strong convergence without density assumptions. We formulate and prove the corresponding theorems, and illustrate them with various examples, such as schemes over metric spaces of compact sets in $\R^n$ and schemes over the Wasserstein space, as well as a geometric Hermite metric space. These results extend subdivision theory beyond Euclidean and manifold-valued data for data in metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Train Operator Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a tensor--train framework for nonintrusive operator inference aimed at learning discrete operators and using them to predict solutions of physical governing equations. Our framework comprises three approaches: full--order tensor--train operator inference, full--order quantized tensor--train operator inference, and reduced--order tensor--train operator inference. In each case, snapshot data is represented in tensor--train format--either through compression or cross interpolation--enabling the efficient handling of extremely large datasets with significantly reduced computational effort compared to standard methods. The effectiveness of each approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments related to Computational Fluid Dynamics and benchmarked against the standard reduced--order operator inference method, highlighting the advantages of the tensor--train representations in both accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a loosely coupled, non-iterative Robin-Robin coupling method proposed and analyzed in [Numer. Algorithms, 99:921-948, 2025] for a parabolic-parabolic interface problem. We modify the first step of the scheme so that several error difference quantities remain higher order convergence without requiring additional assumptions. Numerical results are presented to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Unstructured to structured: geometric multigrid on complex geometries via domain remapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For domains that are easily represented by structured meshes, robust geometric multigrid solvers can quickly provide the numerical solution to many discretized elliptic PDEs. However, for complicated domains with unstructured meshes, constructing suitable hierarchies of meshes becomes challenging. We propose a framework for mapping computations from such complex domains to regular computational domains via diffeomorphisms, enabling the use of robust geometric-style multigrid. This mapping facilitates regular memory accesses during solves, improving efficiency and scalability, especially on massively parallel processors such as GPUs. Moreover, we show that the diffeomorphic mapping itself may be approximately learned using an invertible neural network, facilitating automated application to geometries where no analytic mapping is readily available.</description>

      <title>The Closest Point Heat Method for Solving Eikonal Equations on Implicit Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Closest Point Heat Method (CPHM), a novel approach for solving the surface Eikonal equation on general smooth surfaces. Building on the strengths of the classical heat method, such as simplicity of implementation and computational efficiency, CPHM integrates closest point techniques to reduce dependence on surface meshes. This embedding framework naturally extends the heat method to implicit surfaces while preserving both its efficiency and intrinsic geometric properties. Numerical experiments on benchmark geometries confirm the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness on complex shapes.</description>

      <title>Collocation and Mass Matrix in Least-squares Isogeometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a systematic numerical analysis of the spectral properties of the collocation and mass matrices in the isogeometric least-squares collocation method (IGA-L), for the approximation of the Poisson problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. This study primarily focuses on the spectral properties of the IGA-L collocation and mass matrices in relation to the isogeometric discretization parameters, such as the mesh size, degree, regularity, spatial dimension, and the number and distribution of the collocation points. Through a comprehensive numerical investigation, we provide estimations for the condition number, as well as the maximum and minimum singular values, in relation to the mesh size, degree and regularity. Moreover, in this paper we also study the effect of the number and distribution of the collocation points on the spectral properties of the collocation matrix, providing insights into the optimization of the collocation points for achieving better-conditioned linear systems.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Error Analysis of Explicit Modified Euler Methods for Superlinear and Non-contractive SODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of explicit modified Euler methods (MEMs) is constructed for long-time approximations of super-linear SODEs driven by multiplicative noise. The proposed schemes can preserve the same Lyapunov structure as the continuous problems. Under a non-contractive condition, we establish a non-asymptotic error bound between the law of the numerical approximation and the target distribution in Wasserstein-1 ($\mathcal{W}_1$) distance through a time-independent weak convergence rate for the proposed schemes. As a by-product of this weak error estimate, we obtain an $\mathcal{O}(\tau|\ln \tau|)$ convergence rate between the exact and numerical invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Accuracy analysis and optimization of scale-independent third-order WENO-Z scheme with critical-point accuracy preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the order degradation at critical points in the WENO3-Z scheme, some improvements have been proposed , but these approaches generally fail to consider the occurrence of critical points at arbitrary positions within grid intervals, resulting in their inability to maintain third-order accuracy when a first-order critical point (CP1) occurs. Also, most previous improved schemes suffer from a relatively large exponent p of the ratio of global to local smoothness indicators, which adversely affects the numerical resolution. Concerning these limitations, introduced here is an accuracy-optimization lemma demonstrating that the accuracy of nonlinear weights can be enhanced providing that smoothness indicators satisfy specific conditions, thereby establishing a methodology for elevating the accuracy of nonlinear weights. Leveraging this lemma, a local smoothness indicator is constructed with error terms achieving second-order in smooth regions and fourth-order at CP1, alongside a global smoothness indicator yielding fourth-order accuracy in smooth regions and fifth-order at CP1, enabling the derivation of new nonlinear weights that meet accuracy requirements even when employing p=1. Furthermore, a resolution-optimization lemma is proposed to analyze the relationship between parameters in local smoothness indicators and resolution. By integrating theoretical analysis with numerical practices, free parameters in non-normalized weights and local smoothness indicators are determined under the balance of numerical resolution and robustness, which leads to the development of WENO3-ZES4, a new WENO3-Z improvement that preserves the optimal order at CP1 especially with p=1. 1D and 2D validating tests show that the new scheme consistently achieves third-order in the case of CP1 regardless of its position and exhibits good resolution as well as preferable robustness.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed semi-discrete finite element approximation and full discretization of the Stochastic semilinear generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by additive Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and the semi-implicit method for time discretization and derive a strong convergence rate with respect to both parameters (spatial and temporal). Numerical experiments have also been performed to support theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration through low rank tensor approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical flow iteration method has recently been proposed as a memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov-Poisson equation. It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. If the number of time steps gets large, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given a representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which the characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by restarting the numerical flow iteration after certain time intervals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of the solution at the restart times using the blackbox approximation. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure numerical flow iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step while still keeping its memory complexity. On the other hand, our numerical results demonstrate that the methods preserves the property of the numerical flow iteration of showing much less dissipation of filaments compared to the semi-Lagrangian method.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error analysis and adaptivity of a space-time finite element method for the wave equation in second order formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish rigorous \emph{a posteriori} error bounds for a space-time finite element method of arbitrary order discretising linear wave problems in second order formulation. The method combines standard finite elements in space and continuous piecewise polynomials in time with an upwind discontinuous Galerkin-type approximation for the second temporal derivative. The proposed scheme accepts dynamic mesh modification, as required by space-time adaptive algorithms, resulting in a discontinuous temporal discretisation when mesh changes occur. We prove \emph{a posteriori} error bounds in the $L^\infty(L^2)$-norm, using carefully designed temporal and spatial reconstructions; explicit control on the constants (including the spatial and temporal orders of the method) in those error bounds is shown. The convergence behaviour of an error estimator is verified numerically, also taking into account the effect of the mesh change. A space-time adaptive algorithm is proposed and tested numerically.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Krylov Subspace approximation Based on IDR($s$) Method for Matrix Function Bilinear Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bilinear form u^\top f(A) v of matrix functions appears in many application problems, where u, v \in R^n\), A \in R^{n * n}\), and f(z) is a given analytic function.The IDR(s) method effectively reduces computational complexity and storage requirements by introducing dimension reduction techniques, while maintaining the numerical stability of the algorithm. This paper studies the numerical algorithm and posterior error estimation for the matrix function bilinear form u^{\top} f(A) v based on the IDR(s) method. Through the error analysis of the IDR(s) algorithm, the corresponding error expansion is derived, and it is verified that the leading term of the error expansion serves as a reliable posterior error estimate. Based on this, in this paper a corresponding stopping criterion is proposed. This approach is dedicated to improving computational efficiency, especially by showing excellent performance in handling ill-posed and large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Real-time CBCT reconstructions using Krylov solvers in repeated scanning procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new efficient iterative solver for the reconstruction of real-time cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), which is based on the Prior Image Constrained Compressed Sensing (PICCS) regularization and leverages the efficiency of Krylov subspace methods. In particular, we focus on the setting where a sequence of under-sampled CT scans are taken on the same object with only local changes (e.g. changes in a tumour size or the introduction of a surgical tool). This is very common, for example, in image-guided surgery, where the amount of measurements is limited to ensure the safety of the patient. In this case, we can also typically assume that a (good) initial reconstruction for the solution exists, coming from a previously over-sampled scan, so we can use this information to aid the subsequent reconstructions. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in both a synthetic scan and using real CT data, where it can be observed that the PICCS framework is very effective for the reduction of artifacts, and that the new method is faster than other common alternatives used in the same setting.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal time-space discretizations for a class of nonlinear parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider parabolic evolution equations with Lipschitz continuous and strongly monotone spatial operators. By introducing an additional variable, we construct an equivalent system where the operator is a Lipschitz continuous mapping from a Hilbert space $Y \times X$ to its dual, with a Lipschitz continuous inverse. Resulting Galerkin discretizations can be solved with an inexact Uzawa type algorithm. Quasi-optimality of the Galerkin approximations is guaranteed under an inf-sup condition on the selected `test' and `trial' subspaces of $Y$ and $X$. To circumvent the restriction imposed by this inf-sup condition, an a posteriori condition for quasi-optimality is developed that is shown to be satisfied whenever the test space is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>On the Lebesgue Constant of Extended-Domain Spectral Methods for Elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended-domain method is an appealingly simple strategy for applying spectral methods to complex geometries, but its theoretical stability properties, particularly for non-normal operators, are not fully understood. This paper provides a rigorous stability analysis based on the Lebesgue constant and reveals a fundamental stability dichotomy at the heart of the method. We first prove a surprising result: for the self-adjoint Poisson equation, the method is unstable, with a Lebesgue constant that grows super-polynomially due to the ill-conditioning of spectral differentiation. In stark contrast, we prove that for the non-self-adjoint convection-diffusion equation, the method becomes stable. We show that the first-order convection term regularizes the operator, leading to a provably polynomial bound on the Lebesgue constant. These results, extended here to multiple dimensions and variable coefficients, provide a complete theoretical foundation for this practical method, establishing the precise conditions under which it is stable and highlighting a non-trivial interplay between operator components.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods for the Spherical Shallow Water Equations in Covariant Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order that are well balanced, conservative of mass, and conservative or dissipative of total energy (i.e., a mathematical entropy function) for a covariant flux formulation of the rotating shallow water equations with variable bottom topography on curved manifolds such as the sphere. The proposed methods are based on a skew-symmetric splitting of the tensor divergence in covariant form, which we implement and analyze within a general flux-differencing framework using tensor-product summation-by-parts operators. Such schemes are proven to satisfy semi-discrete mass and energy conservation on general unstructured quadrilateral grids in addition to well balancing for arbitrary continuous bottom topographies, with energy dissipation resulting from a suitable choice of numerical interface flux. Furthermore, the proposed covariant formulation permits an analytical representation of the geometry and associated metric terms while satisfying the aforementioned entropy stability, conservation, and well-balancing properties without the need to approximate the metric terms so as to enforce discrete metric identities. Numerical experiments on cubed-sphere grids are presented in order to verify the schemes' structure-preservation properties as well as to assess their accuracy and robustness within the context of several standard test cases characteristic of idealized atmospheric flows. Our theoretical and numerical results support the further development of the proposed methodology towards a full dynamical core for numerical weather prediction and climate modelling, as well as broader applications to other hyperbolic and advection-dominated systems of partial differential equations on curved manifolds.</description>

      <title>Control of a Uniformly Magnetized Plasma with External Electric Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of plasmas is a challenging topic. We study a control problem for plasma living in a uniform external magnetic field. Linear analysis for any equilibrium $\mu$ is investigated through the Laplace-Fourier transform approach. Moreover, the Penrose condition, which characterizes the stability of equilibrium, is derived for Bernstein modes and verified numerically. Based on the linear analysis, a general control strategy is introduced, with recovering the free-streaming solution as a specific example. We finally present several examples to control instabilities, including Gaussian equilibria and Dory-Guest-Harris instability.</description>

      <title>Contributions to Robust and Efficient Methods for Analysis of High Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of data of our era is their extra-large sizes and dimensions. Analyzing such high-dimensional data poses significant challenges, since the feature dimension is often much larger than the sample size. This thesis introduces robust and computationally efficient methods to address several common challenges associated with high-dimensional data. In my first manuscript, I propose a coherent approach to variable screening that accommodates nonlinear associations. I develop a novel variable screening method that transcends traditional linear assumptions by leveraging mutual information, with an intended application in neuroimaging data. This approach allows for accurate identification of important variables by capturing nonlinear as well as linear relationships between the outcome and covariates. Building on this foundation, I develop new optimization methods for sparse estimation using nonconvex penalties in my second manuscript. These methods address notable challenges in current statistical computing practices, facilitating computationally efficient and robust analyses of complex datasets. The proposed method can be applied to a general class of optimization problems. In my third manuscript, I contribute to robust modeling of high-dimensional correlated observations by developing a mixed-effects model based on Tsallis power-law entropy maximization and discussed the theoretical properties of such distribution. This model surpasses the constraints of conventional Gaussian models by accommodating a broader class of distributions with enhanced robustness to outliers. Additionally, I develop a proximal nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm that accelerates convergence while maintaining numerical stability, along with rigorous statistical properties for the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Model-Driven Subspaces for Large-Scale Optimization with Local Approximation Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving large-scale optimization problems is a bottleneck and is very important for machine learning and multiple kinds of scientific problems. Subspace-based methods using the local approximation strategy are one of the most important methods. This paper discusses different and novel kinds of advanced subspaces for such methods and presents a new algorithm with such subspaces, called MD-LAMBO. Theoretical analysis including the subspaces' properties, sufficient function value decrease, and global convergence is given for the new algorithm. The related model construction on the subspaces is given under derivative-free settings. In numerical results, performance profiles, and truncated Newton step errors of MD-LAMBO using different model-driven subspaces are provided, which show subspace-dependent numerical differences and advantages of our methods and subspaces.</description>

      <title>Tensor Forms of Derivatives of Matrices and their applications in the Solutions to Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors and matrices, and present some identities in terms of these products. We offer tensor expressions of derivatives of tensors, focus on the tensor forms of derivatives of a matrix w.r.t. another matrix. This tensor form makes possible for us to unify ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with partial differential equations (PDEs), and facilitates solution to them in some cases. For our purpose, we also extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors (matrices) to a more general case through any partition of the modes, present some identities in terms of these products, initialize the definition of partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) of a tensor, and use the partial TuckD to simplify the PDEs. We also present a tensor form for the Lyapunov function. Our results in the products of tensors and matrices help us to establish some important equalities on the derivatives of matrices and tensors. An algorithm based on the partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) to solve the PDEs is given, and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Modified Loss of Momentum Gradient Descent: Fine-Grained Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory. Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in $\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics, generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>PCGBandit: One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation. Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g. preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.</description>

      <title>Unidimensional semi-discrete partial optimal transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-discrete formulation of one-dimensional partial optimal transport with quadratic cost, where a probability density is partially transported to a finite sum of Dirac masses of smaller total mass. This problem arises naturally in applications such as risk management, the modeling of crowd motion, and sliced partial transport algorithms for point cloud registration. Unlike higher-dimensional settings, the dual functional in the unidimensional case exhibits reduced regularity. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a regularization procedure based on thickening the density along an auxiliary dimension. We prove that the maximizers of the regularized dual problem converge to those of the original dual problem, with quadratic rate in the introduced thickness. We further provide a numerical scheme that leverages the regularized functional, and we validate our analysis with simulations that confirm the quadratic convergence rate. Finally, we compare the semi-discrete and fully discrete settings, demonstrating that our approach offers both improved stability and computational efficiency for unidimensional partial transport problems.</description>

      <title>A Pathway to Practical Quantum Advantage in Solving Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) promises to tackle classically intractable problems. A key milestone is solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), which has remained formidable for quantum algorithms due to their high input-output overhead and nonlinearity. Here, we establish a full-stack framework that charts a practical pathway to a quantum advantage for large-scale NSE simulation. Our approach integrates a spectral-based input/output algorithm, an explicit and synthesized quantum circuit, and a refined error-correction protocol. The algorithm achieves an end-to-end exponential speedup in asymptotic complexity, meeting the lower bound for general quantum linear system solvers. Through symmetry-based circuit synthesis and optimized error correction, we reduce the required logical and physical resources by two orders of magnitude. Our concrete resource analysis demonstrates that solving NSE on a $2^{80}$-grid is feasible with 8.71 million physical qubits (at an error rate of $5 \times 10^{-4}$) in 42.6 days -- outperforming a state-of-the-art supercomputer, which would require over a century. This work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum speedup and the practical deployment of high-performance scientific computing.</description>

Abstract: We consider a loosely coupled, non-iterative Robin-Robin coupling method proposed and analyzed in [J. Numer. Math., 31(1):59--77, 2023] for a parabolic-parabolic interface problem and prove estimates for the discrete time derivatives of the scalar field in different norms. When the interface is flat and perpendicular to two of the edges of the domain we prove error estimates in the $H^2$-norm. Such estimates are key ingredients to analyze a defect correction method for the parabolic-parabolic interface problem. Numerical results are shown to support our findings.</description>

Specifically we consider linear finite elements discretising space and backward Euler time discretisation. Our analysis relies on a specific geometric assumption on the evolution of the surface. Our main results are $L^2_{H^1}$ error bounds for both the semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes, and we provide some numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design and investigate a variety of multigrid solvers for high-order local discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to elliptic interface and multiphase Stokes problems. Using the template of a standard multigrid V-cycle, we consider a variety of element-wise block smoothers, including Jacobi, multi-coloured Gauss-Seidel, processor-block Gauss-Seidel, and with special interest, smoothers based on sparse approximate inverse (SAI) methods. In particular, we develop SAI methods that: (i) balance the smoothing of velocity and pressure variables in Stokes problems; and (ii) robustly handles high-contrast viscosity coefficients in multiphase problems. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional test cases, including Poisson, elliptic interface, steady-state Stokes, and unsteady Stokes problems, we examine a multitude of multigrid smoother and solver combinations. In every case, there is at least one approach that matches the performance of classical geometric multigrid algorithms, e.g., 4 to 8 iterations reduce the residual by 10 orders of magnitude. We also discuss their relative merits with regard to simplicity, robustness, computational cost, and parallelisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) libraries are widely used for evaluating discrete convolutions. Most FFT implementations follow some variant of the Cooley-Tukey framework, in which the transform is decomposed into butterfly operations and index-reversal permutations. While butterfly operations dominate the floating-point operation count, the memory access patterns induced by index-reversal permutations significantly degrade the FFT's arithmetic intensity. When performing discrete convolution, the three sets of index-reversal permutations which occur in FFT-based implementations using Cooley-Tukey frameworks cancel out, thus paving the way to implementations free of any permutation. To the best of our knowledge, such permutation-free variants of FFT-based discrete convolution are not commonly used in practice, making such kernels worth investigating. Here, we look into such permutation-avoiding convolution procedures for multi-dimensional cases within a general radix Cooley-Tukey framework. We perform numerical experiments to benchmark the algorithms presented against state-of-the-art FFT-based convolution implementations. Our results suggest that developers of FFT libraries should consider supporting permutation-avoiding convolution kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to solve numerically the Cauchy problem for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with a box-type initial condition (IC) having a nontrivial background of amplitude $q_o&gt;0$ as $x\to \pm \infty$ by implementing numerically the corresponding Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). The Riemann--Hilbert problem associated to the inverse transform is solved numerically by means of appropriate contour deformations in the complex plane following the numerical implementation of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. In this work, the box parameters are chosen so that there is no discrete spectrum (i.e., no solitons). The numerical method is demonstrated to be accurate within the two asymptotic regimes corresponding to two different regions of the $(x,t)$-plane depending on whether $|x/(2t)| &lt; q_o$ or $|x/(2t)| &gt; q_o$, as $t \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>A single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method for expectation-constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems, such as those with fairness constraints, involve complex expectation constraints and large datasets, necessitating the design of efficient stochastic methods to solve them. Most existing research focuses on cases with no {constraint} or easy-to-project constraints or deterministic constraints. In this paper, we consider nonconvex nonsmooth stochastic optimization problems with expectation constraints, for which we build a novel exact penalty model. We first show the relationship between the penalty model and the original problem. Then on solving the penalty problem, we present a single-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method, which utilizes the subgradients of both the objective and constraint functions, as well as the constraint function value at each iteration. Under certain regularity conditions (weaker than Slater-type constraint qualification or strong feasibility assumed in existing works), we establish an iteration complexity result of $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ to reach a near-$\epsilon$ stationary point of the penalized problem in expectation, matching the lower bound for such tasks. Building on the exact penalization, an $(\epsilon,\epsilon)$-KKT point of the original problem is obtained. For a few scenarios, our complexity of either the {objective} sample subgradient or the constraint sample function values can be lower than the state-of-the-art results by a factor of $\epsilon^{-2}$. Moreover, on solving two fairness-constrained problems and a multi-class Neyman-Pearson classification problem, our method is significantly (up to 466 times) faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, including switching subgradient method and inexact proximal point methods.</description>

Abstract: Operator learning is the approximation of operators between infinite dimensional Banach spaces using machine learning approaches. While most progress in this area has been driven by variants of deep neural networks such as the Deep Operator Network and Fourier Neural Operator, the theoretical guarantees are often in the form of a universal approximation property. However, the existence theorems do not guarantee that an accurate operator network is obtainable in practice. Motivated by the recent kernel-based operator learning framework, we propose a random feature operator learning method with theoretical guarantees and error bounds. The random feature method can be viewed as a randomized approximation of a kernel method, which significantly reduces the computation requirements for training. We provide a generalization error analysis for our proposed random feature operator learning method along with comprehensive numerical results. Compared to kernel-based method and neural network methods, the proposed method can obtain similar or better test errors across benchmarks examples with significantly reduced training times. An additional advantages it that our implementation is simple and does require costly computational resources, such as GPU.</description>
