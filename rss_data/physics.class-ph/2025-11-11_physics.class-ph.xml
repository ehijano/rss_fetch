      <title>Do Discrete Fine-Scale Mechanical Models with Rotational Degrees of Freedom Homogenize Into a Cosserat or a Cauchy Continuum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article answers the question of whether homogenization of discrete fine-scale mechanical models, such as particle or lattice models, gives rise to an equivalent continuum that is of Cauchy-type or Cosserat-type. The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other. Finally, the study demonstrates that cases for which the Cosserat character of the homogenized response is significant are associated with non-physically high fine-scale bending stiffness and, as such, are of no interest in practice.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional Lightweight Radiators for Small-Satellite Thermal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal management in small satellites is constrained by limited radiative area and strict mass budgets, necessitating the development of radiator structures that are simultaneously lightweight, thermally conductive, and mechanically robust. Here, we present a topology-optimization and design-space analysis framework for multifunctional lightweight radiators that achieve high specific stiffness and high effective thermal conductivity through simultaneous structural and thermal optimization. Density-based optimization produces hierarchical architectures that naturally form continuous cavities suitable for high-conductivity channels such as embedded heat pipes. The resulting microarchitectures exhibit Pareto behavior indicating efficient trade-offs between mass, stiffness, and thermal conductivity, while maintaining dynamic stability across a broad range of design parameters. Coupled structural-thermal analysis shows that voids used as thermal channels yield nearly isothermal radiating surfaces, confirming efficient lateral and transverse heat flow through the radiator. This integrated framework contributes toward the development of thermo-mechanically optimized radiator panels for small-scale spacecraft, enabling compact and efficient thermal control solutions.</description>

      <title>Poncelet property of planar elliptic integrable Kepler billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the integrable dynamics of a Kepler billiard in the plane bounded by a branch of a conic section focused at the Kepler center. We show that in this case, for non-zero-energy orbits, the lines of consecutive second orbital foci along a billiard trajectory are all tangent to a fixed circle. Based on this observation we analyse in details the integrable dynamics of a planar Kepler billiard inside or outside an elliptic reflection wall, with the Kepler center occupying one of its foci. We identify the associated elliptic curve on which the dynamics is linearized, and the shift defined thereon. We also discuss explicit conditions on $n$-periodicity using Cayley's criteria.</description>

      <title>Novel duality-invariant theories of electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify new families of duality-invariant theories of electrodynamics. We achieve this in two different ways. On the one hand, we present an algorithm to construct a one-parameter family of exactly duality-invariant theories from a single seed duality-invariant theory. If the seed theory is causal, the theories constructed from this method will also be causal when the parameter is non-negative. On the other hand, we find two additional novel families of duality-invariant theories which include a nonzero term independent of the electromagnetic field. The first of them generalizes Bialynicki-Birula electrodynamics, while the second family of theories features a well-defined Maxwell limit as the term independent of the gauge field strength is sent to zero.</description>
