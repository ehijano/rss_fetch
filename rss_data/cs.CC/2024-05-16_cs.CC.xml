      <title>Symmetric-Difference (Degeneracy) and Signed Tree Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dense counterpart of graph degeneracy, which extends the recently-proposed invariant symmetric difference. We say that a graph has sd-degeneracy (for symmetric-difference degeneracy) at most $d$ if it admits an elimination order of its vertices where a vertex $u$ can be removed whenever it has a $d$-twin, i.e., another vertex $v$ such that at most $d$ vertices outside $\{u,v\}$ are neighbors of exactly one of $u, v$. The family of graph classes of bounded sd-degeneracy is a superset of that of graph classes of bounded degeneracy or of bounded flip-width, and more generally, of bounded symmetric difference. Unlike most graph parameters, sd-degeneracy is not hereditary: it may be strictly smaller on a graph than on some of its induced subgraphs. In particular, every $n$-vertex graph is an induced subgraph of some $O(n^2)$-vertex graph of sd-degeneracy 1. In spite of this and the breadth of classes of bounded sd-degeneracy, we devise $\tilde{O}(\sqrt n)$-bit adjacency labeling schemes for them, which are optimal up to the hidden polylogarithmic factor. This is attained on some even more general classes, consisting of graphs $G$ whose vertices bijectively map to the leaves of a tree $T$, where transversal edges and anti-edges added to $T$ define the edge set of $G$. We call such graph representations signed tree models as they extend the so-called tree models (or twin-decompositions) developed in the context of twin-width, by adding transversal anti-edges. While computing the degeneracy of an input graph can be done in linear time, we show that deciding whether its symmetric difference is at most 8 is co-NP-complete, and whether its sd-degeneracy is at most 1 is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Recurrence solution of monomer-polymer models on two-dimensional rectangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of counting polymer coverings on the rectangular lattices is investigated. In this model, a linear rigid polymer covers $k$ adjacent lattice sites such that no two polymers occupy a common site. Those unoccupied lattice sites are considered as monomers. We prove that for a given number of polymers ($k$-mers), the number of arrangements for the polymers on two-dimensional rectangular lattices satisfies simple recurrence relations. These recurrence relations are quite general and apply for arbitrary polymer length ($k$) and the width of the lattices ($n$). The well-studied monomer-dimer problem is a special case of the monomer-polymer model when $k=2$. It is known the enumeration of monomer-dimer configurations in planar lattices is #P-complete. The recurrence relations shown here have the potential for hints for the solution of long-standing problems in this class of computational complexity.</description>

      <title>The computational power of discrete chemical reaction networks with bounded executions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) model systems where molecules interact according to a finite set of reactions such as $A + B \to C$, representing that if a molecule of $A$ and $B$ collide, they disappear and a molecule of $C$ is produced. CRNs can compute Boolean-valued predicates $\phi:\mathbb{N}^d \to \{0,1\}$ and integer-valued functions $f:\mathbb{N}^d \to \mathbb{N}$; for instance $X_1 + X_2 \to Y$ computes the function $\min(x_1,x_2)$.
  We study the computational power of execution bounded CRNs, in which only a finite number of reactions can occur from the initial configuration (e.g., ruling out reversible reactions such as $A \rightleftharpoons B$). The power and composability of such CRNs depend crucially on some other modeling choices that do not affect the computational power of CRNs with unbounded executions, namely whether an initial leader is present, and whether (for predicates) all species are required to "vote" for the Boolean output. If the CRN starts with an initial leader, and can allow only the leader to vote, then all semilinear predicates and functions can be stably computed in $O(n \log n)$ parallel time by execution bounded CRNs.
  However, if no initial leader is allowed, all species vote, and the CRN is "noncollapsing" (does not shrink from initially large to final $O(1)$ size configurations), then execution bounded CRNs are severely limited, able to compute only eventually constant predicates. A key tool is to characterize execution bounded CRNs as precisely those with a nonnegative linear potential function that is strictly decreased by every reaction, a result that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Identity Problem in the special affine group of $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09502v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider semigroup algorithmic problems in the Special Affine group $\mathsf{SA}(2, \mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}^2 \rtimes \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$, which is the group of affine transformations of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that preserve orientation. Our paper focuses on two decision problems introduced by Choffrut and Karhum\"{a}ki (2005): the Identity Problem (does a semigroup contain a neutral element?) and the Group Problem (is a semigroup a group?) for finitely generated sub-semigroups of $\mathsf{SA}(2, \mathbb{Z})$. We show that both problems are decidable and NP-complete. Since $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z}) \leq \mathsf{SA}(2, \mathbb{Z}) \leq \mathsf{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z})$, our result extends that of Bell, Hirvensalo and Potapov (2017) on the NP-completeness of both problems in $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$, and contributes a first step towards the open problems in $\mathsf{SL}(3, \mathbb{Z})$.</description>
