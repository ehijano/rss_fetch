      <title>Visualization and Comparison of AOI Transitions with Force-Directed Graph Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing the gaze trajectories of people viewing screens and advertisements, we can determine what people are interested in. This knowledge can be effective when recommending commercial products and services, and also, when improving advertisement design. Therefore, analysis and visualization of eye gaze have been an active research topic. This paper proposes a new method for visualizing patterns of the gaze trajectories of multiple people by (1) visualizing patterns that move through multiple areas of interest (AOI) and (2) visualizing differences among multiple gaze trajectories. The method first constructs a hierarchical AOI structure to a Web page or an image, and uses this structure to convert the trajectory into a sequence of symbols. We apply N-grams to the generated symbol sequences to extract transition patterns between AOIs. Finally, the method visualizes a list of the pattern extraction results and the shapes of the characteristic elements. We present the visualization of gaze trajectories for three examples of stimuli, and argue that analysts can efficiently discover trends in gaze transitions between text and figures, as well as differences between participants of the eye-tracking experiments.</description>

      <title>Designing AI Tools for Clinical Care Teams to Support Serious Illness Conversations with Older Adults in the Emergency Department</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serious illness conversations (SICs), discussions between clinical care teams and patients with serious, life-limiting illnesses about their values, goals, and care preferences, are critical for patient-centered care. Without these conversations, patients often receive aggressive interventions that may not align with their goals. Clinical care teams face significant barriers when conducting serious illness conversations with older adult patients in Emergency Department (ED) settings, where most older adult patients lack documented treatment goals. To understand current practices and identify AI support opportunities, we conducted interviews with two domain experts and nine ED clinical care team members. Through thematic analysis, we characterized a four-phase serious illness conversation workflow (identification, preparation, conduction, documentation) and identified key needs and challenges at each stage. Clinical care teams struggle with fragmented EHR data access, time constraints, emotional preparation demands, and documentation burdens. While participants expressed interest in AI tools for information synthesis, conversational support, and automated documentation, they emphasized preserving human connection and clinical autonomy. We present design guidelines for AI tools supporting SIC workflows that fit within existing clinical practices. This work contributes empirical understanding of ED-based serious illness conversations and provides design considerations for AI in high-stakes clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Understanding Remote Communication between Grandparents and Grandchildren in Distributed Immigrant Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grandparent-grandchild bonds are crucial for both parties. Many immigrant families are geographically dispersed, and the grandparents and grandchildren need to rely on remote communication to maintain their relationships. In addition to geographical separation, grandparents and grandchildren in such families also face language and culture barriers during remote communication. The associated challenges and needs remain understudied as existing research primarily focuses on non-immigrant families or co-located immigrant families. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with six Chinese immigrant families in Canada. Our findings highlight unique challenges faced by immigrant families during remote communication, such as amplified language and cultural barriers due to geographic separation, and provide insights into how technology can better support remote communication. This work offers empirical knowledge about the communication needs of distributed immigrant families and provides directions for future research and design to support grandparent-grandchild remote communication in these families.</description>

      <title>Vid2Coach: Transforming How-To Videos into Task Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People use videos to learn new recipes, exercises, and crafts. Such videos remain difficult for blind and low vision (BLV) people to follow as they rely on visual comparison. Our observations of visual rehabilitation therapists (VRTs) guiding BLV people to follow how-to videos revealed that VRTs provide both proactive and responsive support including detailed descriptions, non-visual workarounds, and progress feedback. We propose Vid2Coach, a system that transforms how-to videos into wearable camera-based assistants that provide accessible instructions and mixed-initiative feedback. From the video, Vid2Coach generates accessible instructions by augmenting narrated instructions with demonstration details and completion criteria for each step. It then uses retrieval-augmented-generation to extract relevant non-visual workarounds from BLV-specific resources. Vid2Coach then monitors user progress with a camera embedded in commercial smart glasses to provide context-aware instructions, proactive feedback, and answers to user questions. BLV participants (N=8) using Vid2Coach completed cooking tasks with 58.5\% fewer errors than when using their typical workflow and wanted to use Vid2Coach in their daily lives. Vid2Coach demonstrates an opportunity for AI visual assistance that strengthens rather than replaces non-visual expertise.</description>

      <title>CO-OPERA: A Human-AI Collaborative Playwriting Tool to Support Creative Storytelling for Interdisciplinary Drama Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drama-in-education is an interdisciplinary instructional approach that integrates subjects such as language, history, and psychology. Its core component is playwriting. Based on need-finding interviews of 13 teachers, we found that current general-purpose AI tools cannot effectively assist teachers and students during playwriting. Therefore, we propose CO-OPERA - a collaborative playwriting tool integrating generative artificial intelligence capabilities. In CO-OPERA, users can both expand their thinking through discussions with a tutor and converge their thinking by operating agents to generate script elements. Additionally, the system allows for iterative modifications and regenerations based on user requirements. A system usability test conducted with middle school students shows that our CO-OPERA helps users focus on whole logical narrative development during playwriting. Our playwriting examples and raw data for qualitative and quantitative analysis are available at https://github.com/daisyinb612/CO-OPERA.</description>

      <title>Fast SSVEP Detection Using a Calibration-Free EEG Decoding Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential is a brain response to visual stimuli flickering at constant frequencies. It is commonly used in brain-computer interfaces for direct brain-device communication due to their simplicity, minimal training data, and high information transfer rate. Traditional methods suffer from poor performance due to reliance on prior knowledge, while deep learning achieves higher accuracy but requires substantial high-quality training data for precise signal decoding. In this paper, we propose a calibration-free EEG signal decoding framework for fast SSVEP detection. Our framework integrates Inter-Trial Remixing &amp; Context-Aware Distribution Alignment data augmentation for EEG signals and employs a compact architecture of small fully connected layers, effectively addressing the challenge of limited EEG data availability. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Spectrum Denoise Module that operates in the frequency domain based on global features, requiring only linear complexity to reduce noise in EEG data and improve data quality. For calibration-free classification experiments on short EEG signals from three public datasets, our framework demonstrates statistically significant accuracy advantages(p&lt;0.05) over existing methods in the majority of cases, while requiring at least 52.7% fewer parameters and 29.9% less inference time. By eliminating the need for user-specific calibration, this advancement significantly enhances the usability of BCI systems, accelerating their commercialization and widespread adoption in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>How Problematic are Suspenseful Interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current "social acceptability" guidelines for interactive technologies advise against certain, seemingly problematic forms of interaction. Specifically, "suspenseful" interactions, characterized by visible manipulations and invisible effects, are generally considered be problematic. However, the empirical grounding for this claim is surprisingly weak. To test its validity, this paper presents a controlled replication study (n = 281) of the "suspensefulness effect". Although it could be statistically replicated with two out of three social acceptability measures, effect sizes were small (r =&lt; .2), and all compared forms of interaction, including the suspenseful one, had high absolute social acceptability scores. Thus, despite the slight negative effect, suspenseful interactions seem less problematic in the overall scheme of things. We discuss alternative approaches to improve the social acceptability of interactive technology, and recommend to more closely engage with their specific social situatedness.</description>

      <title>NoRe: Augmenting Journaling Experience with Generative AI for Music Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Journaling has long been recognized for fostering emotional awareness and self-reflection, and recent advancements in generative AI offer new opportunities to create personalized music that can enhance these practices. In this study, we explore how AI-generated music can augment the journaling experience. Through a formative study, we examined journal writers' writing patterns, purposes, emotional regulation strategies, and the design requirements for the system that augments journaling experience by journal-based AI-generated music. Based on these insights, we developed NoRe, a system that transforms journal entries into personalized music using generative AI. In a seven-day in-the-wild study (N=15), we investigated user engagement and perceived emotional effectiveness through system logs, surveys, and interviews. Our findings suggest that journal-based music generation could support emotional reflection and provide vivid reminiscence of daily experiences. Drawing from these findings, we discuss design implications for tailoring music to journal writers' emotional states and preferences.</description>

      <title>Your Interface, Your Control: Adapting Takeover Requests for Seamless Handover in Semi-Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the automotive industry transitioning towards conditionally automated driving, takeover warning systems are crucial for ensuring safe collaborative driving between users and semi-automated vehicles. However, previous work has focused on static warning systems that do not accommodate different driver states. Therefore, we propose an adaptive takeover warning system that is personalised to drivers, enhancing their experience and safety. We conducted two user studies investigating semi-autonomous driving scenarios in rural and urban environments while participants performed non-driving-related tasks such as text entry and visual search. We investigated the effects of varying time budgets and head-up versus head-down displays for takeover requests on drivers' situational awareness and mental state. Through our statistical and clustering analyses, we propose strategies for designing adaptable takeover systems, e.g., using longer time budgets and head-up displays for non-hazardous takeover events in high-complexity environments while using shorter time budgets and head-down displays for hazardous events in low-complexity environments.</description>

      <title>Prompt Engineer: Analyzing Skill Requirements in the AI Job Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a new job role: the Prompt Engineer. Despite growing interest in this position, we still do not fully understand what skills this new job role requires or how common these jobs are. We analyzed 20,662 job postings on LinkedIn, including 72 prompt engineer positions, to learn more about this emerging role. We found that prompt engineering is still rare (less than 0.5% of sampled job postings) but has a unique skill profile. Prompt engineers need AI knowledge (22.8%), prompt design skills (18.7%), good communication (21.9%), and creative problem-solving (15.8%) skills. These requirements significantly differ from those of established roles, such as data scientists and machine learning engineers, showing that prompt engineering is becoming its own profession. Our findings help job seekers, employers, and educational institutions in better understanding the emerging field of prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>The Automated but Risky Game: Modeling Agent-to-Agent Negotiations and Transactions in Consumer Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.</description>

      <title>Bottom-Up Perspectives on AI Governance: Insights from User Reviews of AI Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2.com, we apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains. These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning, coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain, including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded, user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and digital policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many people suffer from mental health problems but not everyone seeks professional help or has access to mental health care. AI chatbots have increasingly become a go-to for individuals who either have mental disorders or simply want someone to talk to. This paper presents a study on participants who have previously used chatbots and a scenario-based testing of large language model (LLM) chatbots. Our findings indicate that AI chatbots were primarily utilized as a "Five minute therapist" or as a non-judgmental companion. Participants appreciated the anonymity and lack of judgment from chatbots. However, there were concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive information. The scenario-based testing of LLM chatbots highlighted additional issues. Some chatbots were consistently reassuring, used emojis and names to add a personal touch, and were quick to suggest seeking professional help. However, there were limitations such as inconsistent tone, occasional inappropriate responses (e.g., casual or romantic), and a lack of crisis sensitivity, particularly in recognizing red flag language and escalating responses appropriately. These findings can inform both the technology and mental health care industries on how to better utilize AI chatbots to support individuals during challenging emotional periods.</description>

      <title>Feeling Guilty Being a c(ai)borg: Navigating the Tensions Between Guilt and Empowerment in AI Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the emotional, ethical and practical dimensions of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into personal and professional workflows, focusing on the concept of feeling guilty as a 'c(ai)borg' - a human augmented by AI. Inspired by Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto, the study explores how AI challenges traditional notions of creativity, originality and intellectual labour. Using an autoethnographic approach, the authors reflect on their year-long experiences with AI tools, revealing a transition from initial guilt and reluctance to empowerment through skill-building and transparency. Key findings highlight the importance of basic academic skills, advanced AI literacy and honest engagement with AI results.

      <title>Let Them Down Easy! Contextual Effects of LLM Guardrails on User Perceptions and Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy, reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals. Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent, offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and sustained user engagement.</description>

      <title>Curate, Connect, Inquire: A System for Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Human-Robot Centered Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI in robotics has amplified the need for high-quality, reusable datasets, particularly in human-robot interaction (HRI) and AI-embedded robotics. While more robotics datasets are being created, the landscape of open data in the field is uneven. This is due to a lack of curation standards and consistent publication practices, which makes it difficult to discover, access, and reuse robotics data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a curation and access system with two main contributions: (1) a structured methodology to curate, publish, and integrate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) human-centered robotics datasets; and (2) a ChatGPT-powered conversational interface trained with the curated datasets metadata and documentation to enable exploration, comparison robotics datasets and data retrieval using natural language. Developed based on practical experience curating datasets from robotics labs within Texas Robotics at the University of Texas at Austin, the system demonstrates the value of standardized curation and persistent publication of robotics data. The system's evaluation suggests that access and understandability of human-robotics data are significantly improved. This work directly aligns with the goals of the HCRL @ ICRA 2025 workshop and represents a step towards more human-centered access to data for embodied AI.</description>

      <title>MythTriage: Scalable Detection of Opioid Use Disorder Myths on a Video-Sharing Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts, we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and platform moderation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive-VP: A Framework for LLM-Based Virtual Patients that Adapts to Trainees' Dialogue to Facilitate Nurse Communication Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time, while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for nursing communication training.</description>

      <title>Towards Temporally Explainable Dysarthric Speech Clarity Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dysarthria, a motor speech disorder, affects intelligibility and requires targeted interventions for effective communication. In this work, we investigate automated mispronunciation feedback by collecting a dysarthric speech dataset from six speakers reading two passages, annotated by a speech therapist with temporal markers and mispronunciation descriptions. We design a three-stage framework for explainable mispronunciation evaluation: (1) overall clarity scoring, (2) mispronunciation localization, and (3) mispronunciation type classification. We systematically analyze pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models in each stage, assessing their effectiveness in dysarthric speech evaluation (Code available at: https://github.com/augmented-human-lab/interspeech25_speechtherapy, Supplementary webpage: https://apps.ahlab.org/interspeech25_speechtherapy/). Our findings offer clinically relevant insights for automating actionable feedback for pronunciation assessment, which could enable independent practice for patients and help therapists deliver more effective interventions.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Language of Harm: Examining the Role of Emojis in Harmful Online Communication and Content Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity. While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense, the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse. In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered, multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning. Our analysis also reveals heterogeneous effects across offense types, offering nuanced insights for online communication and emoji moderation.</description>

      <title>Bridging Subjective and Objective QoE: Operator-Level Aggregation Using LLM-Based Comment Analysis and Network MOS Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we con- struct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.</description>

      <title>TRiMM: Transformer-Based Rich Motion Matching for Real-Time multi-modal Interaction in Digital Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven digital humans have sparked a series of recent studies on co-speech gesture generation systems. However, existing approaches struggle with real-time synthesis and long-text comprehension. This paper introduces Transformer-Based Rich Motion Matching (TRiMM), a novel multi-modal framework for real-time 3D gesture generation. Our method incorporates three modules: 1) a cross-modal attention mechanism to achieve precise temporal alignment between speech and gestures; 2) a long-context autoregressive model with a sliding window mechanism for effective sequence modeling; 3) a large-scale gesture matching system that constructs an atomic action library and enables real-time retrieval. Additionally, we develop a lightweight pipeline implemented in the Unreal Engine for experimentation. Our approach achieves real-time inference at 120 fps and maintains a per-sentence latency of 0.15 seconds on consumer-grade GPUs (Geforce RTX3060). Extensive subjective and objective evaluations on the ZEGGS, and BEAT datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. TRiMM enhances the speed of co-speech gesture generation while ensuring gesture quality, enabling LLM-driven digital humans to respond to speech in real time and synthesize corresponding gestures.

      <title>$\text{TREX}^2$: Dual-Reconstruction Framework for Teleoperated-Robot with EXtended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot teleoperation with extended reality (XR teleoperation) enables intuitive interaction by allowing remote robots to mimic user motions with real-time 3D feedback. However, existing systems face significant motion-to-motion (M2M) latency--the delay between the user's latest motion and the corresponding robot feedback--leading to high teleoperation error and mission completion time. This issue stems from the system's exclusive reliance on network communication, making it highly vulnerable to network degradation. To address these challenges, we introduce $\text{TREX}^2$, the first end-to-end, fully open-sourced XR teleoperation framework that decouples robot control and XR visualization from network dependencies. $\text{TREX}^2$ leverages local sensing data to reconstruct delayed or missing information of the counterpart, thereby significantly reducing network-induced issues. This approach allows both the XR and robot to run concurrently with network transmission while maintaining high robot planning accuracy. $\text{TREX}^2$ also features contention-aware scheduling to mitigate GPU contention and bandwidth-adaptive point cloud scaling to cope with limited bandwidth. We implement $\text{TREX}^2$ across three hardware settings, including simulated and physical robots, and evaluate it on 9,500 real-world teleoperation trials from the RoboSet dataset \cite{kumar2024robohive}, covering single- and multi-step missions. Compared to state-of-the-art XR teleoperation frameworks, $\text{TREX}^2$ reduces teleoperation error by up to 69.8\% on WLAN and 73.1\% on cellular networks with only 6.7\% maximum runtime overhead. It also improves completion time by up to 47.7\%, enabling smoother teleoperation. A real-world case study on ten stationary and mobile missions further shows $\text{TREX}^2$ achieves up to 37.7\% faster completion while lowering average teleoperation error by up to 57.2\%.</description>

      <title>AgentCPM-GUI: Building Mobile-Use Agents with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover, most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices. AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and $91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.</description>

      <title>Challenges in designing research infrastructure software in multi-stakeholder contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the challenges in designing research infrastructure software for automated software publication in multi-stakeholder environments, focusing specifically on the HERMES system. Through two quantitative surveys of research software engineers (RSEs) and infrastructure facility staff (IFs), it examines technical, organizational, and social requirements across these stakeholder groups. The study reveals significant differences in how RSEs and IFs prioritize various system features. While RSEs highly value compatibility with existing infrastructure, IFs prioritize user-focused aspects like system usability and documentation. The research identifies two main challenges in designing research infrastructure software: (1) the existence of multiple stakeholder groups with differing requirements, and (2) the internal heterogeneity within each stakeholder group across dimensions such as technical experience. The study also highlights that only half of RSE respondents actively practice software publication, pointing to potential cultural or technical barriers. Additionally, the research reveals discrepancies in how stakeholders view organizational aspects, with IFs consistently rating factors like responsibility structures and quality assurance as more important than RSEs do. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complexities involved in designing research infrastructure software and emphasize the need for systems that can accommodate diverse user groups while maintaining usability across different technical expertise levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive visualization editors empower users to author visualizations without writing code, but do not provide guidance on the art and craft of effective visual communication. In this paper, we explore the potential of using an off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) to provide actionable and customized feedback to visualization designers. Our implementation, VISUALIZATIONARY, demonstrates how ChatGPT can be used for this purpose through two key components: a preamble of visualization design guidelines and a suite of perceptual filters that extract salient metrics from a visualization image. We present findings from a longitudinal user study involving 13 visualization designers-6 novices, 4 intermediates, and 3 experts-who authored a new visualization from scratch over several days. Our results indicate that providing guidance in natural language via an LLM can aid even seasoned designers in refining their visualizations.

      <title>"Cold, Calculated, and Condescending": How AI Identifies and Explains Ableism Compared to Disabled People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People with disabilities (PwD) regularly encounter ableist hate and microaggressions online. These spaces are generally moderated by machine learning models, but little is known about how effectively AI models identify ableist speech and how well their judgments align with PwD. To investigate this, we curated a first-of-its-kind dataset of 200 social media comments targeted towards PwD, and prompted state-of-the art AI models (i.e., Toxicity Classifiers, LLMs) to score toxicity and ableism for each comment, and explain their reasoning. Then, we recruited 190 participants to similarly rate and explain the harm, and evaluate LLM explanations. Our mixed-methods analysis highlighted a major disconnect: AI underestimated toxicity compared to PwD ratings, while its ableism assessments were sporadic and varied. Although LLMs identified some biases, its explanations were flawed--they lacked nuance, made incorrect assumptions, and appeared judgmental instead of educational. Going forward, we discuss challenges and opportunities in designing moderation systems for ableism, and advocate for the involvement of intersectional disabled perspectives in AI.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Causal Discovery for Pedestrians-Autonomous Personal Mobility Vehicle Interactions with eHMIs: From Psychological States to Walking Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous personal mobility vehicle (APMV) is a new type of small smart vehicle designed for mixed-traffic environments, including interactions with pedestrians. To enhance the interaction experience between pedestrians and APMVs and to prevent potential risks, it is crucial to investigate pedestrians' walking behaviors when interacting with APMVs and to understand the psychological processes underlying these behaviors. This study aims to investigate the causal relationships between subjective evaluations of pedestrians and their walking behaviors during interactions with an APMV equipped with an external human-machine interface (eHMI). An experiment of pedestrian-APMV interaction was conducted with 42 pedestrian participants, in which various eHMIs on the APMV were designed to induce participants to experience different levels of subjective evaluations and generate the corresponding walking behaviors. Based on the hypothesized model of the pedestrian's cognition-decision-behavior process, the results of causal discovery align with the previously proposed model. Furthermore, this study further analyzes the direct and total causal effects of each factor and investigates the causal processes affecting several important factors in the field of human-vehicle interaction, such as situation awareness, trust in vehicle, risk perception, hesitation in decision making, and walking behaviors.</description>

      <title>Position: Beyond Assistance - Reimagining LLMs as Ethical and Adaptive Co-Creators in Mental Health Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This position paper argues for a fundamental shift in how Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into the mental health care domain. We advocate for their role as co-creators rather than mere assistive tools. While LLMs have the potential to enhance accessibility, personalization, and crisis intervention, their adoption remains limited due to concerns about bias, evaluation, over-reliance, dehumanization, and regulatory uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose two structured pathways: SAFE-i (Supportive, Adaptive, Fair, and Ethical Implementation) Guidelines for ethical and responsible deployment, and HAAS-e (Human-AI Alignment and Safety Evaluation) Framework for multidimensional, human-centered assessment. SAFE-i provides a blueprint for data governance, adaptive model engineering, and real-world integration, ensuring LLMs align with clinical and ethical standards. HAAS-e introduces evaluation metrics that go beyond technical accuracy to measure trustworthiness, empathy, cultural sensitivity, and actionability. We call for the adoption of these structured approaches to establish a responsible and scalable model for LLM-driven mental health support, ensuring that AI complements, rather than replaces, human expertise.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Sensing and Machine Learning to Compare Printed and Verbal Assembly Instructions Delivered by a Social Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare a manual assembly task communicated to workers using both printed and robot-delivered instructions. The comparison was made using physiological signals (blood volume pulse (BVP) and electrodermal activity (EDA)) collected from individuals during an experimental study. In addition, we also collected responses of individuals using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) survey. Furthermore, we mapped the collected physiological signals to the responses of participants for NASA TLX to predict their workload. For both the classification problems, we compare the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Results show that for our CNN-based approach using multimodal data (both BVP and EDA) gave better results than using just BVP (approx. 8.38% more) and EDA (approx 20.49% more). Our LSTM-based model too had better results when we used multimodal data (approx 8.38% more than just BVP and 6.70% more than just EDA). Overall, CNNs performed better than LSTMs for classifying physiologies for paper vs robot-based instruction by 7.72%. The CNN-based model was able to give better classification results (approximately 17.83% more on an average across all responses of the NASA TLX) within a few minutes of training compared to the LSTM-based models.</description>

      <title>REALM: A Dataset of Real-World LLM Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT series, have driven significant industrial applications, leading to economic and societal transformations. However, a comprehensive understanding of their real-world applications remains limited. To address this, we introduce REALM, a dataset of over 94,000 LLM use cases collected from Reddit and news articles. REALM captures two key dimensions: the diverse applications of LLMs and the demographics of their users. It categorizes LLM applications and explores how users' occupations relate to the types of applications they use. By integrating real-world data, REALM offers insights into LLM adoption across different domains, providing a foundation for future research on their evolving societal roles.</description>

      <title>3MDBench: Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are being actively explored in medicine, their ability to conduct telemedicine consultations combining accurate diagnosis with professional dialogue remains underexplored. In this paper, we present 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through four temperament-based Patient Agents and an Assessor Agent that jointly evaluate diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality. It includes 3013 cases across 34 diagnoses drawn from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for popular LVLMs, including GPT-4o-mini, LLaVA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%.

      <title>Completing A Systematic Review in Hours instead of Months with Interactive AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic reviews (SRs) are vital for evidence-based practice in high stakes disciplines, such as healthcare, but are often impeded by intensive labors and lengthy processes that can take months to complete. Due to the high demand for domain expertise, existing automatic summarization methods fail to accurately identify relevant studies and generate high-quality summaries. To that end, we introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in the quality of generated SRs. InsightAgent also provides intuitive visualizations of the corpus and agent trajectories, allowing users to effortlessly monitor the actions of the agent and provide real-time feedback based on their expertise. Our user studies with 9 medical professionals demonstrate that the visualization and interaction mechanisms can effectively improve the quality of synthesized SRs by 27.2%, reaching 79.7% of human-written quality. At the same time, user satisfaction is improved by 34.4%. With InsightAgent, it only takes a clinician about 1.5 hours, rather than months, to complete a high-quality systematic review.</description>

      <title>HiLDe: Intentional Code Generation via Human-in-the-Loop Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers' capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.</description>

      <title>Public versus Less-Public News Engagement on Facebook: Patterns Across Bias and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of social media as a news platform has raised significant concerns about the influence and societal impact of biased and unreliable news on these platforms. While much research has explored user engagement with news on platforms like Facebook, most studies have focused on publicly shared posts. This focus leaves an important question unanswered: how representative is the public sphere of Facebook's entire ecosystem? Specifically, how much of the interactions occur in less-public spaces, and do public engagement patterns for different news classes (e.g., reliable vs. unreliable) generalize to the broader Facebook ecosystem?
  This paper presents the first comprehensive comparison of interaction patterns between Facebook's more public sphere (referred to as public in paper) and the less public sphere (referred to as private). For the analysis, we first collect two complementary datasets: (1) aggregated interaction data for all Facebook posts (public + private) for 19,050 manually labeled news articles (225.3M user interactions), and (2) a subset containing only interactions with public posts (70.4M interactions). Then, through discussions and iterative feedback from the CrowdTangle team, we develop a robust method for fair comparison between these datasets.
  Our analysis reveals that only 31% of news interactions occur in the public sphere, with significant variations across news classes. Engagement patterns in less-public spaces often differ, with users, for example, engaging more deeply in private contexts. These findings highlight the need to examine both public and less-public engagement to fully understand news dissemination on Facebook. The observed differences hold important implications on content moderation, platform governance, and policymaking, contributing to healthier online discourse.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Variation Theory in Counterfactual Data Augmentation for Optimized Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Learning (AL) allows models to learn interactively from user feedback. This paper introduces a counterfactual data augmentation approach to AL, particularly addressing the selection of datapoints for user querying, a pivotal concern in enhancing data efficiency. Our approach is inspired by Variation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the essential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what changes. Instead of just querying with existing datapoints, our approach synthesizes artificial datapoints that highlight potential key similarities and differences among labels using a neuro-symbolic pipeline combining large language models (LLMs) and rule-based models. Through an experiment in the example domain of text classification, we show that our approach achieves significantly higher performance when there are fewer annotated data. As the annotated training data gets larger the impact of the generated data starts to diminish showing its capability to address the cold start problem in AL. This research sheds light on integrating theories of human learning into the optimization of AL.</description>

      <title>Content Moderation by LLM: From Accuracy to Legitimacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One trending application of LLM (large language model) is to use it for content moderation in online platforms. Most current studies on this application have focused on the metric of accuracy -- the extent to which LLMs make correct decisions about content. This article argues that accuracy is insufficient and misleading because it fails to grasp the distinction between easy cases and hard cases, as well as the inevitable trade-offs in achieving higher accuracy. Closer examination reveals that content moderation is a constitutive part of platform governance, the key of which is to gain and enhance legitimacy. Instead of making moderation decisions correct, the chief goal of LLMs is to make them legitimate. In this regard, this article proposes a paradigm shift from the single benchmark of accuracy towards a legitimacy-based framework for evaluating the performance of LLM moderators. The framework suggests that for easy cases, the key is to ensure accuracy, speed, and transparency, while for hard cases, what matters is reasoned justification and user participation. Examined under this framework, LLMs' real potential in moderation is not accuracy improvement. Rather, LLMs can better contribute in four other aspects: to conduct screening of hard cases from easy cases, to provide quality explanations for moderation decisions, to assist human reviewers in getting more contextual information, and to facilitate user participation in a more interactive way. To realize these contributions, this article proposes a workflow for incorporating LLMs into the content moderation system. Using normative theories from law and social sciences to critically assess the new technological application, this article seeks to redefine LLMs' role in content moderation and redirect relevant research in this field.</description>

      <title>If Eleanor Rigby Had Met ChatGPT: A Study on Loneliness in a Post-LLM World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warning: this paper discusses content related, but not limited to, violence, sex, and suicide. Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person's mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs in services like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT outside of its marketed use as a task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22x more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations to research and industry to address loneliness.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Aware Monte Carlo Tree Search for Efficient Information Seeking in Goal-Oriented Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective decision-making and problem-solving in conversational systems require the ability to identify and acquire missing information through targeted questioning. A key challenge lies in efficiently narrowing down a large space of possible outcomes by posing questions that minimize uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate information-seeking questions, with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to strategically select questions that maximize information gain, as a part of inference-time planning. Our primary contribution includes a hierarchical feedback mechanism that exploits past interaction patterns to guide future strategy. Specifically, each new problem is mapped to a cluster based on semantic similarity, and our UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees) formulation employs a cluster-specific bonus reward to prioritize successful question trajectories that have proven effective for similar problems in the past. Extensive empirical evaluation across medical diagnosis and technical troubleshooting domains shows that our method achieves an average of 12% improvement in success rates and about 10x reduction in the number of LLM calls made for planning per conversation, compared to the state of the art. An additional 8% gain in success rate is observed on average when we start with a constrained set of possibilities. Our results underscore the efficacy of feedback-aware MCTS in enhancing information-seeking in goal-oriented dialogues.</description>

      <title>Dialogue Systems for Emotional Support via Value Reinforcement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emotional support dialogue systems aim to reduce help-seekers' distress and help them overcome challenges. While human values$\unicode{x2013}$core beliefs that shape an individual's priorities$\unicode{x2013}$are increasingly emphasized in contemporary psychological therapy for their role in fostering internal transformation and long-term emotional well-being, their integration into emotional support systems remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present a value-driven method for training emotional support dialogue systems designed to reinforce positive values in seekers. Notably, our model identifies which values to reinforce at each turn and how to do so, by leveraging online support conversations from Reddit. We evaluate the method across support skills, seekers' emotional intensity, and value reinforcement. Our method consistently outperforms various baselines, effectively exploring and eliciting values from seekers. Additionally, leveraging crowd knowledge from Reddit significantly enhances its effectiveness. Therapists highlighted its ability to validate seekers' challenges and emphasize positive aspects of their situations$\unicode{x2013}$both crucial elements of value reinforcement. Our work, being the first to integrate value reinforcement into emotional support systems, demonstrates its promise and establishes a foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>How Do LLMs Acquire New Knowledge? A Knowledge Circuits Perspective on Continual Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite exceptional capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical gap in understanding how they internalize new knowledge, particularly how to structurally embed acquired knowledge in their neural computations. We address this issue through the lens of knowledge circuit evolution, identifying computational subgraphs that facilitate knowledge storage and processing. Our systematic analysis of circuit evolution throughout continual pre-training reveals several key findings: (1) the acquisition of new knowledge is influenced by its relevance to pre-existing knowledge; (2) the evolution of knowledge circuits exhibits a distinct phase shift from formation to optimization; (3) the evolution of knowledge circuits follows a deep-to-shallow pattern. These insights not only advance our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of new knowledge acquisition in LLMs, but also provide potential implications for improving continual pre-training strategies to enhance model performance.

      <title>Navigating Rifts in Human-LLM Grounding: Study and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models excel at following instructions but often struggle with the collaborative aspects of conversation that humans naturally employ. This limitation in grounding -- the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding -- can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, we find that early grounding failures predict later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce Rifts, a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on Rifts, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention aimed at mitigating grounding failures.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Governance (HAIG): A Trust-Utility Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g., "human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions (Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds (critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they emerge.</description>

      <title>What is Stigma Attributed to? A Theory-Grounded, Expert-Annotated Interview Corpus for Demystifying Mental-Health Stigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mental-health stigma remains a pervasive social problem that hampers treatment-seeking and recovery. Existing resources for training neural models to finely classify such stigma are limited, relying primarily on social-media or synthetic data without theoretical underpinnings. To remedy this gap, we present an expert-annotated, theory-informed corpus of human-chatbot interviews, comprising 4,141 snippets from 684 participants with documented socio-cultural backgrounds. Our experiments benchmark state-of-the-art neural models and empirically unpack the challenges of stigma detection. This dataset can facilitate research on computationally detecting, neutralizing, and counteracting mental-health stigma. Our corpus is openly available at https://github.com/HanMeng2004/Mental-Health-Stigma-Interview-Corpus.</description>

      <title>The Many Challenges of Human-Like Agents in Virtual Game Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-like agents are an increasingly important topic in games and beyond. Believable non-player characters enhance the gaming experience by improving immersion and providing entertainment. They also offer players the opportunity to engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or cooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.
  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimizing User Preferences in AI Copilots: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI copilots represent a new generation of AI-powered systems designed to assist users, particularly knowledge workers and developers, in complex, context-rich tasks. As these systems become more embedded in daily workflows, personalization has emerged as a critical factor for improving usability, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the system's ability to detect, interpret, and align with individual user preferences. While prior work in intelligent assistants and optimization algorithms is extensive, their intersection within AI copilots remains underexplored. This survey addresses that gap by examining how user preferences are operationalized in AI copilots. We investigate how preference signals are sourced, modeled across different interaction stages, and refined through feedback loops. Building on a comprehensive literature review, we define the concept of an AI copilot and introduce a taxonomy of preference optimization techniques across pre-, mid-, and post-interaction phases. Each technique is evaluated in terms of advantages, limitations, and design implications. By consolidating fragmented efforts across AI personalization, human-AI interaction, and language model adaptation, this work offers both a unified conceptual foundation and a practical design perspective for building user-aligned, persona-aware AI copilots that support end-to-end adaptability and deployment.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide for Supporting Formative Assessment and Feedback Using Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formative assessment is a cornerstone of effective teaching and learning, providing students with feedback to guide their learning. While there has been an exponential growth in the application of generative AI in scaling various aspects of formative assessment, ranging from automatic question generation to intelligent tutoring systems and personalized feedback, few have directly addressed the core pedagogical principles of formative assessment. Here, we critically examined how generative AI, especially large-language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, can support key components of formative assessment: helping students, teachers, and peers understand "where learners are going," "where learners currently are," and "how to move learners forward" in the learning process. With the rapid emergence of new prompting techniques and LLM capabilities, we also provide guiding principles for educators to effectively leverage cost-free LLMs in formative assessments while remaining grounded in pedagogical best practices. Furthermore, we reviewed the role of LLMs in generating feedback, highlighting limitations in current evaluation metrics that inadequately capture the nuances of formative feedback, such as distinguishing feedback at the task, process, and self-regulatory levels. Finally, we offer practical guidelines for educators and researchers, including concrete classroom strategies and future directions such as developing robust metrics to assess LLM-generated feedback, leveraging LLMs to overcome systemic and cultural barriers to formative assessment, and designing AI-aware assessment strategies that promote transferable skills while mitigating overreliance on LLM-generated responses. By structuring the discussion within an established formative assessment framework, this review provides a comprehensive foundation for integrating LLMs into formative assessment in a pedagogically informed manner.</description>

      <title>The CASE Framework -- A New Architecture for Participatory Research and Digital Health Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the CASE framework, an open-source platform for adaptive, context-aware participatory research, and pandemic preparedness. CASE implements an event-driven architecture that enables dynamic survey workflows, allowing real-time adaptation based on participant responses, external data, temporal conditions, and evolving user states. The framework supports a broad range of research needs, from simple one-time questionnaires to complex longitudinal studies with advanced conditional logic. Built on over a decade of practical experience, CASE underwent a major architectural rework in 2024, transitioning from a microservice-based design to a streamlined monolithic architecture. This evolution significantly improved maintainability, flexibility, and accessibility to deployment, particularly for institutions with limited technical capacity. CASE has been successfully deployed across diverse domains, powering national disease surveillance platforms, supporting post-COVID cohort studies, and enabling real-time sentiment analysis during political events. These applications, involving tens of thousands of participants, demonstrate the framework's scalability, versatility, and practical value. This paper describes the foundations of CASE, details its architectural evolution, and presents lessons learned from real-world deployments. We establish CASE as a mature and reusable research infrastructure that balances sophisticated functionality with practical implementation, addressing the critical global need for sustainable and institutionally controlled data collection systems.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Guardrails for Open-World Decision Making in Autonomous Drone Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications. While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design, simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in search-and-rescue missions.</description>

      <title>Estimating LLM Consistency: A User Baseline vs Surrogate Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitive to prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliable generated text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and fragility -- one of them being measuring the consistency (the model's confidence in the response, or likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled) of LLM responses. In previous work, measuring consistency often relied on the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled responses, or internal states or logits of responses. However, it is not yet clear how well these approaches approximate how humans perceive the consistency of LLM responses. We performed a user study (n=2,976) and found current methods typically do not approximate users' perceptions of LLM consistency very well. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency, and we show that this method matches the performance of the best-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that methods of estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect that we suggest evaluation with human input be more broadly used.</description>

      <title>Guiding Generative Storytelling with Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automated story generation, but challenges remain in maintaining long-form coherence and providing users with intuitive and effective control. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in reducing hallucinations in text generation; however, the use of structured data to support generative storytelling remains underexplored. This paper investigates how knowledge graphs (KGs) can enhance LLM-based storytelling by improving narrative quality and enabling user-driven modifications. We propose a KG-assisted storytelling pipeline and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study with 15 participants. Participants created their own story prompts, generated stories, and edited knowledge graphs to shape their narratives. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, our findings demonstrate that knowledge graphs significantly enhance story quality in action-oriented and structured narratives within our system settings. Additionally, editing the knowledge graph increases users' sense of control, making storytelling more engaging, interactive, and playful.</description>
