      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Fluid Leakage and Fault Instability in Geologic CO2 Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geologic CO$_2$ storage is an important strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and mitigating climate change. In this process, coupling between mechanical deformation and fluid flow in fault zones is a key determinant of fault instability, induced seismicity, and CO$_2$ leakage. Using a recently developed methodology, PREDICT, we obtain probability distributions of the permeability tensor in faults from the stochastic placement of clay smears that accounts for geologic uncertainty. We build a comprehensive set of fault permeability scenarios from PREDICT and investigate the effects of uncertainties from the fault zone internal structure and composition on forecasts of CO$_2$ permanence and fault stability. To tackle the prohibitively expensive computational cost of the large number of simulations required to quantify uncertainty, we develop a deep-learning-based surrogate model capable of predicting flow migration, pressure buildup, and geomechanical responses in CO$_2$ storage operations. We also compare our probabilistic estimation of CO$_2$ leakage and fault instability with previous studies based on deterministic estimates of fault permeability. The results highlight the importance of including uncertainty and anisotropy in modeling of complex fault structures and improved management of geologic CO$_2$ storage projects.</description>

      <title>What day is the peak of death in France?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, 639,300 people died in France, 35,900 fewer than in 2022, a year of high mortality. Over the last twenty years, from 2004 to 2023, January 3rd was the deadliest day, while August 15th was the least deadly one. Elderly people die significantly less often in the summer. Deaths are also less frequent on public holidays and Sundays. Finally, the risk of dying is higher on one's birthday, especially for young people.</description>

      <title>q Index Degree Distribution in Random Networks via Superstatistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ a superstatistical approach to construct q exponential and q Maxwell Boltzmann complex networks, generalizing the concept of scale free networks. By adjusting the crossover parameter {\lambda}, we control the degree of the q exponential plateau at low node degrees, allowing a smooth transition to pure power law degree distributions. Similarly, the parameter b modulates the q Maxwell Boltzmann curvature, facilitating a shift toward pure power law networks. This framework introduces a novel perspective for constructing and analyzing scale free networks. Our results show that these additional degrees of freedom significantly enhance the flexibility of both network types in terms of topological and transport properties, including clustering coefficients, small world characteristics, and resilience to attacks. Future research will focus on exploring the dynamic properties of these networks, offering promising directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in the numerical integration of evolution equations based on Bayesian isotonic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new Bayesian framework for quantifying discretization errors in numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. By modelling the errors as random variables, we impose a monotonicity constraint on the variances, referred to as discretization error variances. The key to our approach is the use of a shrinkage prior for the variances coupled with variable transformations. This methodology extends existing Bayesian isotonic regression techniques to tackle the challenge of estimating the variances of a normal distribution. An additional key feature is the use of a Gaussian mixture model for the $\log$-$\chi^2_1$ distribution, enabling the development of an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm for the corresponding posterior.</description>

      <title>Machine learning models with different cheminformatics data sets to forecast the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) regression models along with three cheminformatics data sets (RDkit, Mordred, Morgan) have been used to predict the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The data consists of cheinformatics descriptors of the electron donor used in 433 OSCs for which the experimental PCE (target variable) is reported in the literature. The donor is either a polymer or a small organic molecule, and the acceptor the fullerene derivatives PCBM or PC71BM. Unlike previous methods, our ML approach considers the type of donor and the acceptor by adding four extra donor's features using the one-hot encoder tool. It is demonstrated that this additional information improves the prediction performance up to 34%. We have also exploited this feature to theoretically forecast the PCE of new OSCs by evaluating the ML model for a different acceptor. It is predicted that more than 50% of the OCSs obtained by exchanging the acceptor would have higher experimental PCE. The prediction accuracy of a given ML approach is analyzed for different PCE intervals. RF using RDkit descriptors resulted in the best ML approach with a Pearson's correlation coefficient for the training and testing sets equal to 0.96 and 0.62, respectively.</description>
