      <title>Finiteness and finite domination in stratified homotopy theory</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study compactness and finiteness of an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a conservative functor to a finite poset $P$. We provide sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ to be compact in terms of strata and homotopy links of $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow P$. Analogous conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ to be finite are also given. From these, we deduce that, if $X\rightarrow P$ is a conically stratified space with the property that the weak homotopy type of its strata, and of strata of its local links, are compact (respectively finite) $\infty$-groupoids, then $\text{Exit}_P(X)$ is compact (respectively finite). This gives a positive answer to a question of Porta and Teyssier. If $X\rightarrow P$ is equipped with a conically smooth structure (e.g. a Whitney stratification), we show that $\text{Exit}_P(X)$ is finite if and only the weak homotopy types of the strata of $X\rightarrow P$ are finite. The aforementioned characterization relies on the finiteness of $\text{Exit}_P(X)$, when $X\rightarrow P$ is compact and conically smooth. We conclude our paper by showing that the analogous statement does not hold in the topological category. More explicitly, we provide an example of a compact $C^0$-stratified space whose exit paths $\infty$-category is compact, but not finite. This stratified space was constructed by Quinn. We also observe that this provides a non-trivial example of a $C^0$-stratified space which does not admit any conically smooth structure.</description>

      <title>Constructing projective modules</title>

Abstract: We discuss elements of a social history of the theory of projective modules over commutative rings. We attempt to study the question: how did the theory of projective modules become one of "mainstream" focus in mathematics? To do this, we begin in what one might call the pre-history of projective modules, describing the mathematical culture into which the notion of projective module was released. These recollections involve four pieces: (a) analyzing aspects of the theory of fiber bundles, as it impinges on algebraic geometry, (b) understanding the rise of homological techniques in algebraic topology, (c) describing the influence of category-theoretic ideas in topology and algebra and (d) revisiting the story of the percolation of sheaf-theoretic ideas through algebraic geometry.
  We will then argue that it was this unique confluence of mathematical events that allowed projective modules to emerge as objects of central mathematical importance. More precisely, we will first argue that, in the context of social currents of the time, projective modules initially were isolated as objects of purely technical convenience reflecting the aesthetic sensibilities of the creators of the fledgling theory of homological algebra. Only later did they transcend this limited role to become objects of "mainstream importance" due to influence from the theory of algebraic fiber bundles and the theory of sheaves. Along the way, we aim to show how strong personal ties emanating from the Bourbaki movement and its connections in mathematical centers including Paris, Princeton and Chicago were essential to the entrance, propagation and mainstream mathematical acceptance of the theory.</description>

      <title>A categorical interpretation of Morita equivalence for dynamical von Neumann algebras</title>

Abstract: $\DeclareMathOperator{\G}{\mathbb{G}}\DeclareMathOperator{\Rep}{Rep} \DeclareMathOperator{\Corr}{Corr}$Let $\G$ be a locally compact quantum group and $(M, \alpha)$ a $\G$-$W^*$-algebra. The object of study of this paper is the $W^*$-category $\Rep^{\G}(M)$ of normal, unital $\G$-representations of $M$ on Hilbert spaces endowed with a unitary $\G$-representation. This category has a right action of the category $\Rep(\G)= \Rep^{\G}(\mathbb{C})$ for which it becomes a right $\Rep(\G)$-module $W^*$-category. Given another $\G$-$W^*$-algebra $(N, \beta)$, we denote the category of normal $*$-functors $\Rep^{\G}(N)\to \Rep^{\G}(M)$ compatible with the $\Rep(\G)$-module structure by $\operatorname{Fun}_{\Rep(\G)}(\Rep^{\G}(N), \Rep^{\G}(M))$ and we denote the category of $\G$-$M$-$N$-correspondences by $\operatorname{Corr}^{\G}(M,N)$. We prove that there are canonical functors $P: \Corr^{\G}(M,N)\to \operatorname{Fun}_{\Rep(\G)}(\Rep^{\G}(N), \Rep^{\G}(M))$ and $Q: \operatorname{Fun}_{\Rep(\G)}(\Rep^{\G}(N), \Rep^{\G}(M))\to \operatorname{Corr}^{\G}(M,N)$ such that $Q \circ P\cong \operatorname{id}.$ We use these functors to show that the $\G$-dynamical von Neumann algebras $(M, \alpha)$ and $(N, \beta)$ are equivariantly Morita equivalent if and only if $\Rep^{\G}(N)$ and $\Rep^{\G}(M)$ are equivalent as $\Rep(\G)$-module-$W^*$-categories. Specializing to the case where $\G$ is a compact quantum group, we prove that moreover $P\circ Q \cong \operatorname{id}$, so that the categories $\Corr^{\G}(M,N)$ and $\operatorname{Fun}_{\Rep(\G)}(\Rep^{\G}(N), \Rep^{\G}(M))$ are equivalent. This is an equivariant version of the Eilenberg-Watts theorem for actions of compact quantum groups on von Neumann algebras.</description>
