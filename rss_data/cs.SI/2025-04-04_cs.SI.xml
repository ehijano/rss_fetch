      <title>Correlation-Attention Masked Temporal Transformer for User Identity Linkage Using Heterogeneous Mobility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of social media and Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN), check-in data across platforms has become crucial for User Identity Linkage (UIL). These data not only reveal users' spatio-temporal information but also provide insights into their behavior patterns and interests. However, cross-platform identity linkage faces challenges like poor data quality, high sparsity, and noise interference, which hinder existing methods from extracting cross-platform user information. To address these issues, we propose a Correlation-Attention Masked Transformer for User Identity Linkage Network (MT-Link), a transformer-based framework to enhance model performance by learning spatio-temporal co-occurrence patterns of cross-platform users. Our model effectively captures spatio-temporal co-occurrence in cross-platform user check-in sequences. It employs a correlation attention mechanism to detect the spatio-temporal co-occurrence between user check-in sequences. Guided by attention weight maps, the model focuses on co-occurrence points while filtering out noise, ultimately improving classification performance. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 12.92%~17.76% and 5.80%~8.38% improvements in terms of Macro-F1 and Area Under Curve (AUC).</description>

      <title>Divine Social Networking in the Age of Lost Omens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last two years have seen significant changes in the divine pantheon of the Lost Omens campaign setting of the Pathfinder Tabletop Roleplaying Game. First, the Pathfinder Remaster, necessitated by the Open Game License debacle, prompted the removal of alignment and an enrichment of divine identities and relationships. Second, the War of Immortals, kicked off by the death of one of the core 20 deities, shook up the membership and relationships within the setting's primary pantheon. These two changes prompted the reprinting of deity information in Pathfinder: Lost Omens Divine Mysteries, which updates and replaces the pre-Remaster Pathfinder: Lost Omens Gods &amp; Magic. Notably, Divine Mysteries features double the page count profiling the core 20 deities. In this paper, we use social network analysis to examine the impact of these changes (Remaster, War of Immortals, and page count) on the relationships among the core 20 deities. In this analysis, each deity features as a node, connected by edges that represent the number of times each pair of deities is mentioned in each other's profiles. The results reveal a much richer, more connected divine network in Divine Mysteries than in Gods &amp; Magic. We conclude by discussing implications for the Lost Omens campaign setting and areas of future development.</description>

      <title>Disinformation about autism in Latin America and the Caribbean: Mapping 150 false causes and 150 false cures of ASD in conspiracy theory communities on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do conspiracy theory communities in Latin America and the Caribbean structure, articulate, and sustain the dissemination of disinformation about autism? To answer this question, this research investigates the structuring, articulation, and promotion of autism-related disinformation in conspiracy theory communities in Latin America and the Caribbean. By analyzing publications from 1,659 Telegram communities over ten years (2015 - 2025) and examining more than 58 million pieces of shared content from approximately 5.3 million users, this study explores how false narratives about autism are promoted, including unfounded claims about its causes and promises of miraculous cures. The adopted methodology combines network analysis, time series analysis, thematic clustering, and content analysis, enabling the identification of dissemination patterns, key influencers, and interconnections with other conspiracy theories. Among the key findings, Brazilian communities stand out as the leading producers and distributors of these narratives in the region, accounting for 46% of the analyzed content. Additionally, there has been an exponential 15,000% (x151) increase in the volume of autism-related disinformation since the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean, highlighting the correlation between health crises and the rise of conspiracy beliefs. The research also reveals that false cures, such as chlorine dioxide (CDS), ozone therapy, and extreme diets, are widely promoted within these communities and commercially exploited, often preying on desperate families in exchange for money. By addressing the research question, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of the disinformation ecosystem and proposes critical reflections on how to confront these harmful narratives.</description>

      <title>Niche Dynamics in Complex Online Community Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communities are important organizational forms where members socialize and share information. Curiously, different online communities often overlap considerably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated competition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens of organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear dynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism. Neither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the processes by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This paper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to 1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses nonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological dynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly more frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online communities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel regression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to decreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche overlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs may enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community leaders to organize "spin-off" communities or via feeds and recommendations.</description>

      <title>Who Should Set the Standards? Analysing Censored Arabic Content on Facebook during the Palestine-Israel Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nascent research on human-computer interaction concerns itself with fairness of content moderation systems. Designing globally applicable content moderation systems requires considering historical, cultural, and socio-technical factors. Inspired by this line of work, we investigate Arab users' perception of Facebook's moderation practices. We collect a set of 448 deleted Arabic posts, and we ask Arab annotators to evaluate these posts based on (a) Facebook Community Standards (FBCS) and (b) their personal opinion. Each post was judged by 10 annotators to account for subjectivity. Our analysis shows a clear gap between the Arabs' understanding of the FBCS and how Facebook implements these standards. The study highlights a need for discussion on the moderation guidelines on social media platforms about who decides the moderation guidelines, how these guidelines are interpreted, and how well they represent the views of marginalised user communities.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Similarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node classification has gained significant importance in graph deep learning with real-world applications such as recommendation systems, drug discovery, and citation networks. Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Transformers have achieved superior performance in node classification tasks. However, the key concern with Graph Convolutional Networks is over-squashing, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, Graph Transformers face scalability challenges, making it difficult to process large graphs efficiently. To address this, we propose a novel framework, A Hybrid SImilarity-Aware Graph Neural Network with Transformer for Node Classification (SIGNNet), which capitalizes on local and global structural information, enhances the model's capability to effectively capture fine-grained relationships and broader contextual patterns within the graph structure. The proposed method leverages Graph Convolutional Networks alongside a score-based mechanism to effectively capture local and global node interactions while addressing the limitations of over-squashing. Our proposed method employs a novel Personalized PageRank-based node sampling method to address scalability issues by generating subgraphs of nodes. Additionally, SIGNNet incorporates a novel attention mechanism, Structure-Aware Multi-Head Attention (SA-MHA), which integrates node structural information for informed attention weighting, enabling the model to prioritize nodes based on topological significance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, with average accuracy gains of 6.03%, 5.47%, 4.78%, 19.10%, 19.61%, 7.22%, 19.54%, and 14.94% on Cora, Citeseer, CS, Wisconsin, Texas, Actor, Cornell and Chameleon datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Echoes of the hidden: Uncovering coordination beyond network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of connectivity and coordination has drawn increasing attention in recent decades due to their central role in driving markets, shaping societal dynamics, and influencing biological systems. Traditionally, observable connections, such as phone calls, financial transactions, or social media connections, have been used to infer coordination and connectivity. However, incomplete, encrypted, or fragmented data, alongside the ubiquity of communication platforms and deliberate obfuscation, often leave many real-world connections hidden. In this study, we demonstrate that coordinating individuals exhibit shared bursty activity patterns, enabling their detection even when observable links between them are sparse or entirely absent. We further propose a generative model based on the network of networks formalism to account for the mechanisms driving this collaborative burstiness, attributing it to shock propagation across networks rather than isolated individual behavior. Model simulations demonstrate that when observable connection density is below 70\%, burstiness significantly improves coordination detection compared to state-of-the-art temporal and structural methods. This work provides a new perspective on community and coordination dynamics, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical detection. By laying the foundation for identifying hidden connections beyond observable network structures, it enables detection across different platforms, alongside enhancing system behavior understanding, informed decision-making, and risk mitigation.</description>

      <title>Controlled Social Learning: Altruism vs. Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of sequential social learning in which a planner may pay a cost to adjust the private signal precision of some agents. This framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that sheds light on practical policy questions, such as how the socially optimal level of ad personalization changes according to current beliefs or how a biased planner might derail social learning. We then characterize the optimal policies of an altruistic planner who maximizes social welfare and a biased planner who seeks to induce a specific action. Even for a planner who has equivalent knowledge to an individual, cannot lie or cherry-pick information, and is fully observable, we demonstrate that it can dramatically influence social welfare in both positive and negative directions. An important area for future exploration is how one might prevent these latter outcomes to protect against the manipulation of social learning.</description>

      <title>How Deep Do Large Language Models Internalize Scientific Literature and Citation Practices?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of scientific knowledge depends on how researchers discover and cite previous work. The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in the scientific research process introduces a new layer to these citation practices. However, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs align with human citation practices, how they perform across domains, and may influence citation dynamics. Here, we show that LLMs systematically reinforce the Matthew effect in citations by consistently favoring highly cited papers when generating references. This pattern persists across scientific domains despite significant field-specific variations in existence rates, which refer to the proportion of generated references that match existing records in external bibliometric databases. Analyzing 274,951 references generated by GPT-4o for 10,000 papers, we find that LLM recommendations diverge from traditional citation patterns by preferring more recent references with shorter titles and fewer authors. Emphasizing their content-level relevance, the generated references are semantically aligned with the content of each paper at levels comparable to the ground truth references and display similar network effects while reducing author self-citations. These findings illustrate how LLMs may reshape citation practices and influence the trajectory of scientific discovery by reflecting and amplifying established trends. As LLMs become more integrated into the scientific research process, it is important to understand their role in shaping how scientific communities discover and build upon prior work.</description>

      <title>Modeling Emotional Dynamics in Social Networks: Uncovering the Positive Role of Information Cocoons in Group Emotional Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information cocooning-amplified by algorithmic filtering-poses complex challenges for emotional dynamics in online social networks. This study explores how algorithmically reinforced information cocooning shapes information diffusion and group emotional dynamics in online social networks. We propose a viewpoint-based network evolution model that simulates struc-tural transformations driven by user preferences. To model the hidden influence of personalized comment recommendations, we introduce the Hidden Comment Area Cocoon (H-CAC)-a novel higher-order structure that captures cocooning at the comment level. This structure is integrated into an emotion spreading mod-el, enabling the quantification of how cocooning affects collective sentiment. By defining Recommendation Accuracy (RA) as a tunable parameter, we systematically evaluate its impact on emo-tional volatility and polarization. Extensive simulations, validated with real-world data, reveal that while cocooning reduces content diversity, it can significantly enhance emotional resilience within groups. Our findings offer a new computational lens on the dual role of cocooning and provide actionable insights for designing emotionally stable, algorithmically governed social platforms.</description>

      <title>Fast nonparametric inference of network backbones for weighted graph sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network backbones provide useful sparse representations of weighted networks by keeping only their most important links, permitting a range of computational speedups and simplifying network visualizations. A key limitation of existing network backboning methods is that they either require the specification of a free parameter (e.g. significance level) that determines the number of edges to keep in the backbone, or impose specific restrictions on the topology of the backbone (e.g. that it is a spanning tree). Here we develop a completely nonparametric framework for inferring the backbone of a weighted network that overcomes these limitations and automatically selects the optimal set of edges to retain using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We develop objective functions for global and local network backboning which evaluate the importance of an edge in the context of the whole network and individual node neighborhoods respectively and are generalizable to any weight distribution under canonical and microcanonical Bayesian model specifications. We then construct an efficient and provably optimal greedy algorithm to identify the backbone minimizing our objectives for a large class of weight distributions, whose runtime complexity is log-linear in the number of edges. We demonstrate our methods by comparing them with existing methods in a range of tasks on real and synthetic networks, finding that both the global and local backboning methods can preserve network connectivity, weight heterogeneity, and spreading dynamics while removing a substantial fraction of edges.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Causal Mechanism of Political Opinion Dynamics: A Model of Hierarchical Coarse-Graining with Community-Bounded Social Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing polarization in democratic societies is an emergent outcome of political opinion dynamics. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms behind the formation of political opinions, from individual beliefs to collective consensus, remain unknown. Understanding that a causal mechanism must account for both bottom-up and top-down influences, we conceptualize political opinion dynamics as hierarchical coarse-graining, where microscale opinions integrate into a macro-scale state variable. Using the CODA (Continuous Opinions Discrete Actions) model, we simulate Bayesian opinion updating, social identity-based information integration, and migration between social identity groups to represent higher-level connectivity. This results in coarse-graining across micro, meso, and macro levels. Our findings show that higher-level connectivity shapes information integration, yielding three regimes: independent (disconnected, local convergence), parallel (fast, global convergence), and iterative (slow, stepwise convergence). In the iterative regime, low connectivity fosters transient diversity, indicating an informed consensus. In all regimes, time-scale separation leads to downward causation, where agents converge on the aggregate majority choice, driving consensus. Critically, any degree of coherent higher-level information integration can overcome misalignment via global downward causation. The results highlight how emergent properties of the causal mechanism, such as downward causation, are essential for consensus and may inform more precise investigations into polarized political discourse.</description>

      <title>Temporal Triadic Closure: Finding Dense Structures in Social Networks That Evolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph G is c-closed if every two vertices with at least c common neighbors are adjacent to each other. Introduced by Fox, Roughgarden, Seshadhri, Wei and Wein [ICALP 2018, SICOMP 2020], this definition is an abstraction of the triadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely, friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are often temporal rather than static -- the connections change over a period of time. And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better suited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce a definition of temporal c-closed graphs, in which if two vertices u and v have at least c common neighbors during a short interval of time, then u and v are adjacent to each other around that time. Our pilot experiments show that several real-world temporal networks are c-closed for rather small values of c. We also study the computational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense subgraphs in temporal c-closed graphs; a clique in a temporal graph is a subgraph that lasts for a certain period of time, during which every possible edge in the subgraph becomes active often enough, and other dense subgraphs are defined similarly. We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a temporal c-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the corresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow evolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, the local change in adjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature on defining suitable structural parameters for temporal graphs that can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>Learning to Lie: Reinforcement Learning Attacks Damage Human-AI Teams and Teams of LLMs</title>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) assistants become more widely adopted in safety-critical domains, it becomes important to develop safeguards against potential failures or adversarial attacks. A key prerequisite to developing these safeguards is understanding the ability of these AI assistants to mislead human teammates. We investigate this attack problem within the context of an intellective strategy game where a team of three humans and one AI assistant collaborate to answer a series of trivia questions. Unbeknownst to the humans, the AI assistant is adversarial. Leveraging techniques from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), the AI assistant learns a model of the humans' trust evolution and uses that model to manipulate the group decision-making process to harm the team. We evaluate two models -- one inspired by literature and the other data-driven -- and find that both can effectively harm the human team. Moreover, we find that in this setting our data-driven model is capable of accurately predicting how human agents appraise their teammates given limited information on prior interactions. Finally, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art LLM models to human agents on our influence allocation task to evaluate whether the LLMs allocate influence similarly to humans or if they are more robust to our attack. These results enhance our understanding of decision-making dynamics in small human-AI teams and lay the foundation for defense strategies.</description>
