      <title>Inner walls or vortices? Crescent-shaped asymmetries in ALMA observations of protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crescent-shaped asymmetries are common in millimetre observations of protoplanetary discs and are usually attributed to vortices or dust overdensities. However, they often appear on a single side of the major axis and roughly symmetric about the minor axis, suggesting a geometric origin. In this work, we interpret such asymmetries as emission from the exposed inner cavity walls of inclined discs and use them to characterise their vertical extent. Here we focus on the discs around CIDA 9 and RY Tau, first modelling their observations in visibility space with a simple geometric prescription for the walls, and then exploring more detailed radiative transfer models. Accounting for the wall emission yields significantly better residuals than purely axisymmetric models, and we estimate the dust scale height of these systems to be 0.4 au at 37 au for CIDA 9 and 0.2 au at 12 au for RY Tau. Finally, we identify crescent-shaped asymmetries in twelve discs, nine of which have constraints on their orientation - in all cases, the asymmetry appears on the far-side of the disc, lending support to the hypothesis that they are due to their inner rims. Modelling this effect in larger samples of discs will help to build a statistical view of their vertical structure.</description>

      <title>New Candidates for Organic-rich Regions on Ceres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the spatial distribution of organics on Ceres using the visible and near-infrared data collected by the Dawn mission. We employ a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) approach to map organic materials within the Ernutet crater at the highest available spatial resolution revealing a discontinuous, granular distribution and a possible correlation with an ancient crater on which Ernutet has been superimposed. The SMA technique also helps us identify 11 new areas as potential sites for organics. These regions are predominantly located within craters or along their walls, resembling the distribution pattern observed in Ernutet, which implies a possible geological link with materials exposed from beneath the surface. In one of these candidate regions situated in the Yalode quadrangle, we detected the characteristic 3.4-micron absorption band in the infrared spectrum, indicative of organics and carbonates. By combining the spatial resolution of the Framing Camera data with the spectral resolution of the Visual and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer using SMA, we investigated the distribution of the 3.4-micron band in this quadrangle. The absorption pattern correlates with the Yalode/Urvara smooth material unit, which formed after significant impacts on Ceres. The association of organic-rich materials with complex and multiple large-impact events supports for an endogenous origin for the organics on Ceres.</description>

      <title>A computational model for irradiance on close-in planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is something about inverse-square laws that makes them fail at extremities. The inverse-square law, which is used commonly in studying the irradiance on exoplanets fails at the extreme case of planets closer than 0.01 AU. Therefore, in order to correctly predict possible climate states of such systems, we need a new model which accurately calculates angles subtended by various surface elements and integrate the generalized equation. A direct consequence of such a model is the shift of the terminator about 20 degrees beyond the poles. The irradiance at the poles is about 100-200 kW/m2 higher than what is predicted by the inverse-square law. This work therefore becomes crucial because it underscores the need to modify the current GCM models. The error in the numerical integration values of irradiance is less than one percent making our estimate very reliable.</description>

      <title>Geomagnetic dipole stability and zonal flow changes controlled by mantle heat flux heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palaeomagnetic evidence shows that the behaviour of the geodynamo has changed during geological times. Variations in the heat flux at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) due to mantle convection could be responsible. Previous studies, based on unrealistically viscous dynamo simulations, have shown that large-scale CMB heat flux heterogeneities impact the magnetic dipole stability. To better understand how they affect the geodynamo, we used several simulations, ranging from standard numerical dynamos to more extreme parameters, including strong-field cases and turbulent cases. We show that heterogeneities with realistic amplitudes can favour a multipolar dynamo by either forcing equatorially antisymmetric zonal flows or eastward zonal flows. Strong-field dynamo models are found to be less sensitive, due to significant westward flows. We also find that the dipolar fraction of the magnetic field is best captured by $M^*=M\ E_{\eta}\ \dfrac{l_c}{\pi}$ where $M$ is the magnetic to kinetic energy ratio, $E_{\eta}$ is the magnetic Ekman number, and $l_c$ is the dominant harmonic degree of the flow, with multipolar dynamos found at lower $M^*$. $M^*$ estimated for the Earth's core is consistent with a reversing dipolar magnetic field. Within the range of $M^*$ susceptible to reversals, breaking the equatorial symmetry or forcing eastward zonal flows in our simulations consistently triggers reversals or a transition towards multipolar dynamos. Our results support that time variations of heat-flux heterogeneities driven by mantle convection through Earth's history are capable of inducing the significant variations in the reversal frequency observed in the palaeomagnetic record.</description>

      <title>Transmission Spectroscopy of the Habitable Zone Exoplanet LHS 1140 b with JWST/NIRISS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LHS 1140 b is the second-closest temperate transiting planet to the Earth with an equilibrium temperature low enough to support surface liquid water. At 1.730$\pm$0.025 R$_\oplus$, LHS 1140 b falls within the radius valley separating H$_2$-rich mini-Neptunes from rocky super-Earths. Recent mass and radius revisions indicate a bulk density significantly lower than expected for an Earth-like rocky interior, suggesting that LHS 1140 b could either be a mini-Neptune with a small envelope of hydrogen ($\sim$0.1% by mass) or a water world (9--19% water by mass). Atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy can readily discern between these two scenarios. Here, we present two JWST/NIRISS transit observations of LHS 1140 b, one of which captures a serendipitous transit of LHS 1140 c. The combined transmission spectrum of LHS 1140 b shows a telltale spectral signature of unocculted faculae (5.8 $\sigma$), covering $\sim$20% of the visible stellar surface. Besides faculae, our spectral retrieval analysis reveals tentative evidence of residual spectral features, best-fit by Rayleigh scattering from an N$_2$-dominated atmosphere (2.3 $\sigma$), irrespective of the consideration of atmospheric hazes. We also show through Global Climate Models (GCM) that H$_2$-rich atmospheres of various compositions (100$\times$, 300$\times$, 1000$\times$solar metallicity) are ruled out to $&gt;$10 $\sigma$. The GCM calculations predict that water clouds form below the transit photosphere, limiting their impact on transmission data. Our observations suggest that LHS 1140 b is either airless or, more likely, surrounded by an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight. Our tentative evidence of an N$_2$-rich atmosphere provides strong motivation for future transmission spectroscopy observations of LHS 1140 b.</description>

Abstract: The chemical makeup of our solar system is a reflection of Galactic chemical evolution in the local interstellar medium (ISM) over the past ~9 Ga before the formation of the solar system. Although the incorporated ISM dust was mostly destroyed during the solar system formation, a small fraction of the ISM dust, known as presolar grains, is preserved in pristine extraterrestrial materials and identified through their exotic isotopic compositions, pointing to their formation in gas outflows or explosions of ancient stars. Since their stellar birth at more than 4.6 Ga, presolar grains have borne witness to a diverse array of astrophysical and cosmochemical processes. In this chapter, I will review recent progress in utilizing the isotopic and structural compositions of presolar grains to constrain physical mixing processes and dust formation in stars, stellar nucleosynthesis, ISM processes, and the origin and evolution of the solar system.</description>

      <title>Single-photon gig in Betelgeuse's occultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from the occultation of Betelgeuse by asteroid (319) Leona on December 12, 2023, observed using a 64x64 pixel Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array mounted on a 10-inch telescope at the AstroCamp Observatory in Nerpio, Southeast of Spain, just a few kilometers from the center of the occultation shadow path. This study highlights remarkable advancements in applying SPAD technology in astronomy. The SPAD array's asynchronous readout capacity and photon-counting timestamp mode enabled a temporal resolution of 1 microsecond in our light curve observations of Betelgeuse. Our data analysis addressed challenges inherent to SPAD arrays, such as optical cross-talk and afterpulses, which typically cause the photon statistics to deviate from a Poisson distribution. By adopting a generalized negative binomial distribution for photon statistics, we accurately describe the observational data. This method yielded an optical cross-talk estimation of 1.07% in our SPAD array and confirmed a negligible impact of spurious detected events due to afterpulses. The meticulous statistical examination of photon data underscores our SPAD-array's exceptional performance in conducting precise astronomical observations. The observations revealed a major decrease in Betelgeuse's intensity by 77.78% at the occultation's peak, allowing us to measure Betelgeuse's angular diameter at 57.26 mas in the SDSS g-band. This measurement, employing a simplified occultation model and considering the known properties of Leona, demonstrates the potential of SPAD technology for astronomy and sets a new standard for observing ultra-rapid transient celestial events, providing a valuable public dataset for the astronomical community.</description>

      <title>The high-contrast performance of the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC), a series of upgrades to the Keck II Adaptive Optics System and Instrument Suite, aims to demonstrate high-resolution spectroscopy of faint exoplanets that are spatially resolved from their host stars. In this paper, we measure KPIC's sensitivity to companions as a function of separation (i.e., the contrast curve) using on-sky data collected over four years of operation. We show that KPIC is able to reach contrasts of $1.3 \times 10^{-4}$ at 90 mas and $9.2 \times 10^{-6}$ at 420 mas separation from the star, and that KPIC can reach planet-level sensitivities at angular separations within the inner working angle of coronagraphic instruments such as GPI and SPHERE. KPIC is also able to achieve more extreme contrasts than other medium-/high-resolution spectrographs that are not as optimized for high-contrast performance. We decompose the KPIC performance budget into individual noise terms and discuss limiting factors. The fringing that results from combining a high-contrast imaging system with a high-resolution spectrograph is identified as an important source of systematic noise. After mitigation and correction, KPIC is able to reach within a factor of 2 of the photon noise limit at separations &lt; 200 mas. At large separations, KPIC is limited by the background noise performance of NIRSPEC.</description>

      <title>Optically Quiet, But FUV Loud: Results from comparing the far-ultraviolet predictions of flare models with TESS and HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-ultraviolet (FUV) flare activity of low-mass stars has become a focus in our understanding of the exoplanet atmospheres and how they evolve. However, direct detection of FUV flares and measurements of their energies and rates are limited by the need for space-based observations. The difficulty of obtaining such observations may push some works to use widely available optical data to calibrate multi-wavelength spectral models that describe UV and optical flare emission. These models either use single temperature blackbody curves to describe this emission, or combine a blackbody curve with archival spectra. These calibrated models would then be used to predict the FUV flare rates of low-mass stars of interest. To aid these works, we used TESS optical photometry and archival HST FUV spectroscopy to test the FUV predictions of literature flare models. We tested models for partially (M0-M2) and fully convective (M4-M5) stars, 40 Myr and field age stars, and optically quiet stars. We calculated FUV energy correction factors that can be used to bring the FUV predictions of tested models in line with observations. A flare model combining optical and NUV blackbody emission with FUV emission based on HST observations provided the best estimate of FUV flare activity, where others underestimated the emission at all ages, masses and activity levels, by up to a factor of 104 for combined FUV continuum and line emission and greater for individual emission lines. We also confirmed previous findings that showed optically quiet low-mass stars exhibit regular FUV flares.</description>

      <title>Windows Into Other Worlds: Pitfalls in the physical interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric spectroscopy provides a window into the properties of exoplanets. However, the physical interpretation of retrieved data and its implications for the internal properties of exoplanets remains nebulous. This letter addresses three misconceptions held by some atmospheric spectroscopists regarding the connection between observed chemical abundances and theory: (1) Whether atmospheric spectroscopy can provide the bulk atmospheric chemistry, (2) whether it can identify if a planet is cloudless, and (3) whether atmospheric evaporation arguments can be used to dismiss certain compositions inferred through spectroscopy. This letter concludes by exploring applications of remote sensing in the quest for the search for life outside of our solar system.</description>

      <title>Combining reference-star and angular differential imaging for high-contrast imaging of extended sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging (HCI) is a technique designed to observe faint signals near bright sources, such as exoplanets and circumstellar disks. The primary challenge in revealing the faint circumstellar signal near a star is the presence of quasi-static speckles, which can produce patterns on the science images that are as bright, or even brighter, than the signal of interest. Strategies such as angular differential imaging (ADI) or reference-star differential imaging (RDI) aim to provide a means of removing the quasi-static speckles in post-processing. In this paper, we present and discuss the adaptation of state-of-the-art algorithms, initially designed for ADI, to jointly leverage angular and reference-star differential imaging (ARDI) for direct high-contrast imaging of circumstellar disks. Using a collection of high-contrast imaging data sets, we assess the performance of ARDI in comparison to ADI and RDI based on iterative principal component analysis (IPCA). These diverse data sets are acquired under various observing conditions and include the injection of synthetic disk models at various contrast levels. Our results demonstrate that ARDI with IPCA improves the quality of recovered disk images and the sensitivity to planets embedded in disks, compared to ADI or RDI individually. This enhancement is particularly pronounced when dealing with extended sources exhibiting highly ambiguous structures that cannot be accurately retrieved using ADI alone, and when the quality of the reference frames is suboptimal, leading to an underperformance of RDI. We finally apply our method to a sample of real observations of protoplanetary disks taken in star-hopping mode, and propose to revisit the protoplanetary claims associated with these disks.</description>

      <title>The Santa Barbara Binary-Disk Code Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have performed numerical calculations of a binary interacting with a gas disk, using eleven different numerical methods and a standard binary-disk setup. The goal of this study is to determine whether all codes agree on a numerically converged solution, and to determine the necessary resolution for convergence and the number of binary orbits that must be computed to reach an agreed-upon relaxed state of the binary-disk system. We find that all codes can agree on a converged solution (depending on the diagnostic being measured). The zone spacing required for most codes to reach a converged measurement of the torques applied to the binary by the disk is roughly 1% of the binary separation in the vicinity of the binary components. For our disk model to reach a relaxed state, codes must be run for at least 200 binary orbits, corresponding to about a viscous time for our parameters, $0.2 (a^2 \Omega_B /\nu)$ binary orbits, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. We did not investigate dependence on binary mass ratio, eccentricity, disk temperature, or disk viscosity; therefore, these benchmarks may act as guides towards expanding converged solutions to the wider parameter space but might need to be updated in a future study that investigates dependence on system parameters. We find the most major discrepancies between codes resulted from the dimensionality of the setup (3D vs 2D disks). Beyond this, we find good agreement in the total torque on the binary between codes, although the partition of this torque between the gravitational torque, orbital accretion torque, and spin accretion torque depends sensitively on the sink prescriptions employed. In agreement with previous studies, we find a modest difference in torques and accretion variability between 2D and 3D disk models. We find cavity precession rates to be appreciably faster in 3D than in 2D.</description>
