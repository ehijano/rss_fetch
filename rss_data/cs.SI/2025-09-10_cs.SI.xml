      <title>Free Elections in the Free State: Ensemble Analysis of Redistricting in New Hampshire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of legislative redistricting in New Hampshire, along with many other states across the country, was particularly contentious during the 2020 census cycle. In this paper we present an ensemble analysis of the enacted districts to provide mathematical context for claims made about these maps in litigation. Operationalizing the New Hampshire redistricting rules and algorithmically generating a large collection of districting plans allows us to construct a baseline for expected behavior of districting plans in the state and evaluate non-partisan justifications and geographic tradeoffs between districting criteria and partisan outcomes. In addition, our results demonstrate the impact of selection and aggregation of election data for analyzing partisan symmetry measures.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization Considering Influence, Cost and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence maximization has been studied for social network analysis, such as viral marketing (advertising), rumor prevention, and opinion leader identification. However, most studies neglect the interplay between influence spread, cost efficiency, and temporal urgency. In practical scenarios such as viral marketing and information campaigns, jointly optimizing Influence, Cost, and Time is essential, yet remaining largely unaddressed in current literature. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes a new multi-objective influence maximization problem that simultaneously optimizes influence, cost, and time. We show the intuitive and empirical evidence to prove the feasibility and necessity of this multi-objective problem. We also develop an evolutionary variable-length search algorithm that can effectively search for optimal node combinations. The proposed EVEA algorithm outperforms all baselines, achieving up to 19.3% higher hypervolume and 25 to 40% faster convergence across four real-world networks, while maintaining a diverse and balanced Pareto front among influence, cost, and time objectives.</description>

      <title>Multi-Topic Projected Opinion Dynamics for Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of opinion formation on resource allocation among multiple topics by multiple agents, who are subject to hard budget constraints. We define a utility function for each agent and then derive a projected dynamical system model of opinion evolution assuming that each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility subject to its constraints. Inter-agent coupling arises from an undirected social network, while inter-topic coupling arises from resource constraints. We show that opinions always converge to the equilibrium set. For special networks with very weak antagonistic relations, the opinions converge to a unique equilibrium point. We further show that the underlying opinion formation game is a potential game. We relate the equilibria of the dynamics and the Nash equilibria of the game and characterize the unique Nash equilibrium for networks with no antagonistic relations. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Multilevel User Credibility Assessment in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online social networks serve as major platforms for disseminating both real and fake news. Many users--intentionally or unintentionally--spread harmful content, misinformation, and rumors in domains such as politics and business. Consequently, user credibility assessment has become a prominent area of research in recent years. Most existing methods suffer from two key limitations. First, they treat credibility as a binary task, labeling users as either genuine or fake, whereas real-world applications often demand a more nuanced, multilevel evaluation. Second, they rely on only a subset of relevant features, which constrains their predictive performance. In this paper, we address the lack of a dataset suitable for multilevel credibility assessment by first devising a collection method tailored to this task. We then propose the \textit{MultiCred} model, which assigns users to one of several credibility tiers based on a rich and diverse set of features extracted from their profiles, tweets, and comments. MultiCred leverages deep language models for textual analysis and deep neural networks for non-textual data processing. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiCred significantly outperforms existing approaches across multiple accuracy metrics. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Mohammad-Moradi/MultiCred.</description>

      <title>Revealing The Secret Power: How Algorithms Can Influence Content Visibility on Twitter/X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17390v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the opaque design and the limited public understanding of social networks' recommendation algorithms have raised concerns about potential manipulation of information exposure. Reducing content visibility, aka shadow banning, may help limit harmful content; however, it can also be used to suppress dissenting voices. This prompts the need for greater transparency and a better understanding of this practice.
  In this paper, we investigate the presence of visibility alterations through a large-scale quantitative analysis of two Twitter/X datasets comprising over 40 million tweets from more than 9 million users, focused on discussions surrounding the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the 2024 US Presidential Elections. We use view counts to detect patterns of reduced or inflated visibility and examine how these correlate with user opinions, social roles, and narrative framings. Our analysis shows that the algorithm systematically penalizes tweets containing links to external resources, reducing their visibility by up to a factor of eight, regardless of the ideological stance or source reliability. Rather, content visibility may be penalized or favored depending on the specific accounts producing it, as observed when comparing tweets from the Kyiv Independent and RT.com or tweets by Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Overall, our work highlights the importance of transparency in content moderation and recommendation systems to protect the integrity of public discourse and ensure equitable access to online platforms.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Network-aware Direct Search Method for Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) is a pivotal concept in social network analysis, involving the identification of influential nodes within a network to maximize the number of influenced nodes, and has a wide variety of applications that range from viral marketing and information dissemination to public health campaigns. IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a black-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that maximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not require gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike gradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the objective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current solution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from scalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially when applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes the Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search approach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood formulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of the IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested our method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art approaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various greedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically confirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the graph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can significantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context.</description>

      <title>Research on Conversational Recommender System Considering Consumer Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users' heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs. satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book, and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Personalized Pricing Through Strategic User Profiling in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional user profiling techniques rely on browsing history or purchase records to identify users' willingness to pay. This enables sellers to offer personalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to non-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies has caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online sellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to better track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper presents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their social activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller should strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in social networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller and users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this game comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well as among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure consistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under random user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying backward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as the accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the equilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and facilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off after the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data access and profiling practices by potential sellers. This finding suggests that recent regulatory evolution towards enhancing users' privacy awareness may have unintended consequences of reducing users' payoffs.</description>
