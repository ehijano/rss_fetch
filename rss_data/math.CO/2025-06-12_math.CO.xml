      <title>Proof of a conjecture on isolation of graphs with a universal vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A copy of a graph $F$ is called an $F$-copy. For any graph $G$, the $F$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,F)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects the vertex sets of the $F$-copies contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $F$-copy). Thus, $\iota(G,K_1)$ is the domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$, and $\iota(G,K_2)$ is the vertex-edge domination number of $G$. Settling a conjecture of Zhang and Wu, the first author proved that if $F$ is a $k$-edge graph, $\gamma(F) = 1$ (that is, $F$ has a vertex that is adjacent to all the other vertices of $F$), and $G$ is a connected $m$-edge graph, then $\iota(G,F) \leq \frac{m+1}{k+2} $ unless $G$ is an $F$-copy or $F$ is a $3$-path and $G$ is a $6$-cycle. We prove another conjecture of Zhang and Wu by determining the graphs that attain the bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Samuel's conjecture on certain Graham positivity of the expansion coefficient of two double Schubert polynomials in three sets of variables by establishing a refined version of Graham's positivity theorem. As a corollary, we prove Kirillov's conjecture on the positivity of skew divided difference operators applied to Schubert polynomials.</description>

      <title>Partial independent transversals in multipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given integers $r&gt;d\ge 0$ and an $r$-partite graph, an independent $(r-d)$-transversal or $(r-d)$-IT is an independent set of size $r-d$ that intersects each part in at most one vertex. We show that every $r$-partite graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ and parts of size $n$ contains an $(r-d)$-IT if $n&gt; 2\Delta (1-\frac{1}{q})$, provided $q= \lfloor \frac{r}{d+1}\rfloor\ge \frac{4r}{4d+5}$. This is tight when $q$ is even and extends a classical result of Haxell in the $d=0$ case. When $q= \lfloor \frac{r}{d+1} \rfloor\ge \frac{6r+6d+7}{6d+7}$ is odd, we show that $n&gt; 2\Delta(1-\frac{1}{q-1})$ guarantees an $(r-d)$-IT in any $r$-partite graph. This is also tight and extends a result of Haxell and Szab\'o in the $d=0$ case. In addition, we show that $n&gt; 5\Delta/4$ guarantees a $5$-IT in any $6$-partite graph and this bound is tight, answering a question of Lo, Treglown and Zhao.</description>

      <title>Minimal hypergraph non-jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-uniform hypergraph, or $r$-graph, has density $|E(G)|/|V(G)^{(r)}|$. We say $\alpha$ is a jump for $r$-graphs if there is some constant $\delta=\delta(\alpha)$ such that, for each $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $n\geq r$, any sufficiently large $r$-graph of density at least $\varepsilon$ has a subgraph of order $n$ and density at least $\alpha+\delta$. For $r=2$, all $\alpha$ are jumps. For $r\geq 3$, Erd\H{o}s showed all $[0,\frac{r!}{r^r})$ are jumps, and conjectured all $[0,1)$ are jumps. Since then, a variety of non-jumps have been proved, using a method introduced by Frankl and R\"odl.
  Our aim in this paper is to provide a general setting for this method. As an application, we give several new non-jumps, which are smaller than any previously known. We also demonstrate that these are the smallest the current method can prove.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Faudree and Schelp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1976 Faudree and Schelp conjectured that in a hamiltonian-connected graph on $n$ vertices, any two distinct vertices are connected by a path of length $k$ for every $k \ge n/2$. In 1978 Thomassen constructed a (non-cubic and non-planar) family of counterexamples, showing that there exist hamiltonian-connected $n$-vertex graphs containing two vertices with no path of length $n-2$ between them. We complement this result by describing cubic planar counterexamples on $6p+16$ vertices, each containing vertices between which there is no path of any odd length greater than $1$ and at most $4p+9$. Motivated by a remark of Thomassen about a gap in the cycle spectrum of hamiltonian-connected graphs, we also describe an infinite family of hamiltonian-connected graphs with many gaps in the first half of their cycle spectra.</description>

      <title>Cycles and paths through vertices whose degrees are at least the bipartite-hole-number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bipartite-hole-number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that there exist positive integers $s$ and $t$ with $s + t = k + 1$, satisfying the property that for any two disjoint sets $A, B \subseteq V(G)$ with $|A| = s$ and $|B| = t$, there is at least one edge between $A$ and $B$. In 1992, Bollob\'as and Brightwell, and independently Shi, proved that every $2$-connected graph of order $n$ contains a cycle passing through all vertices whose degrees are at least $\frac{n}{2}$. Motivated by their result, we show that in any $2$-connected graph of order $n$, there exists a cycle containing all vertices whose degrees are at least $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$. Moreover, we prove that for any pair of vertices in a connected graph $G$, if their degrees are at least $\widetilde{\alpha}(G) + 1$, then there exists a path joining them that contains all vertices whose degrees are at least $\widetilde{\alpha}(G) + 1$. The results extend two existing ones.</description>

      <title>On saturation numbers of complete multipartite graphs and even cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given positive integer $n$ and graph $F$, the saturation number $\mathrm{sat}(n, F)$ is the minimum number of edges in an edge-maximal $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices. In this paper, we determine asymptotic behavior of $\mathrm{sat}(n, F)$ when $F$ is either a complete multipartite graph or a cycle graph whose length is even and large enough. This extends a result by Bohman, Fonoberova, and Pikhurko from 2010 as well as partially resolves a conjecture of F\"uredi and Kim from 2013.</description>

      <title>Immersions of large cliques in graphs with independence number 2 and bounded maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An immersion of a graph $H$ in a graph $G$ is a minimal subgraph $I$ of $G$ for which there is an injection ${{\rm i}} \colon V(H) \to V(I)$ and a set of edge-disjoint paths $\{P_e: e \in E(H)\}$ in $I$ such that the end vertices of $P_{uv}$ are precisely ${{\rm i}}(u)$ and ${{\rm i}}(v)$. The immersion analogue of Hadwiger Conjecture (1943), posed by Lescure and Meyniel (1985), asks whether every graph $G$ contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$. Its restriction to graphs with independence number 2 has received some attention recently, and Vergara (2017) raised the weaker conjecture that every graph with independence number 2 has an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$. This implies that every graph with independence number 2 has an immersion of $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$. In this paper, we verify Vergara Conjecture for graphs with bounded maximum degree. Specifically, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with independence number $2$, maximum degree less than $2n/3 - 1$ and clique covering number at most $3$, then $G$ contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$ (and thus of $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$). Using a result of Jin (1995), this implies that if $G$ is a graph with independence number $2$ and maximum degree less than $19n/29 - 1$, then $G$ contains an immersion of $K_{\chi(G)}$ (and thus of $K_{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we provide a simple inductive proof of the Poincar\'e inequality on the monotone sets, which is firstly established by Fei and Pinto Jr. using directed heat semigroup method. Such inequality improves the mixing time upper bound of the censored random walk on constant-density monotone sets from $O(n^3)$ by Ding and Mossel to $O(n^2)$.</description>

      <title>Study of $p^{k}$-Eulerian polynomials and $p^{k}$-Fibonacci numbers for every odd prime $p$ and $k\geq0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the notion of descent for the paths in the $p$-Bratteli diagram. This leads to the definition of $p^{k}$-Eulerian polynomials, whose coefficients count the number of paths with a given number of descents. We provide a method for constructing the $p^{k}$-Eulerian polynomials at each vertex. Furthermore, we compute the total number of descents of all paths ending at a given vertex as the corresponding $p^{k}$-Fibonacci numbers. We show that the derivative of the $p^{k}$-Eulerian polynomial evaluated at 1 for a fixed vertex equals the corresponding $p^{k}$-Fibonacci number. Finally, we discuss the generating function for the sequence of $p^{k}$-Fibonacci numbers and the recurrence relations they satisfy.</description>

      <title>Crossing numbers of dense graphs on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on the crossing numbers of dense graphs on surfaces, which match up to constant factors. First, we prove that if $G$ is a dense enough graph with $m$ edges and $\Sigma$ is a surface of genus $g$, then any drawing of $G$ on $\Sigma$ incurs at least $\Omega \left(\frac{m^2}{g} \log ^2 g\right)$ crossings. The poly-logarithmic factor in this lower bound is new even in the case of complete graphs and disproves a conjecture of Shahrokhi, Sz\'ekely and Vrt'o from 1996. Then we prove a geometric converse to this lower bound: we provide an explicit family of hyperbolic surfaces such that for any graph $G$, sampling the vertices uniformly at random on this surface and connecting them with shortest paths yields $O\left(\frac{m^2}{g} \log ^2 g\right)$ crossings in expectation.</description>

      <title>The bunkbed conjecture still holds for cactus graphs and for graphs with certain biconnected components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the bunkbed conjecture has been shown to be false, which naturally prompts questions on how to classify the graphs that still satisfy the conjecture. We distinguish between a weak version of the bunkbed conjecture where all the horizontal edges of the bunkbed graph are present with the same probability and a strong version of the conjecture where the edge weights on the underlying graph may be assigned individually. We show that any given graph satisfies either version of the conjecture if and only if all of its biconnected components do. Moreover, we show that all cactus graphs satisfy the strong version, and by combining previous results of other authors, any graph $G$ such that every biconnected component of $G$ is either a cycle, complete, complete bipartite, symmetric complete $k$-partite or an edge difference of a complete graph and a complete subgraph satisfies the weak version. Furthermore, we apply the aforementioned results to show that any counterexample to the strong version of the bunkbed conjecture contains a non-trivial subdivision of the diamond graph as a minor and demonstrate how this result might be strengthened in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study binomial ideals generated by an arbitrary collection of corner-interval $2$-minors of a generic matrix. We determine the minimal prime ideals of such ideals and characterize their radicality in the special case of corner minors. Moreover, we discuss connectivity properties of contingency tables in algebraic statistics. We compute the Hilbert-Poincar\'e polynomial of the ideal generated by the set of all corner-interval minors and we derive the formula for the regularity in the case of corner minors.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the superpotentials and slices of tropical currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the question of the continuity of slices of currents and explain how it relates to several seemingly unrelated problems in tropical geometry. On the one hand, through this lens, we show that the continuity of superpotentials constitutes a very general instance of stable intersection theory in tropical geometry. On the other hand, questions concerning tropicalisation with respect to a non-trivial valuation and the commutativity of tropicalisation with intersections offer insights to the problem of the continuity of slices of currents converging to a tropical current. Within our framework, we reformulate and reprove known theorems in tropical geometry and derive new results and techniques in both tropical geometry and complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A strengthened bound on the number of states required to characterize maximum parsimony distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the distance $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ between two unrooted binary phylogenetic trees $T_1, T_2$ on the same set of taxa can be defined by a character that is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$ and which has at most $2k$ states. This significantly improves upon the previous bound of $7k-5$ states. We also show that for every $k \geq 1$ there exist two trees $T_1, T_2$ with $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ such that at least $k+1$ states are necessary in any character that achieves this distance and which is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$.</description>

      <title>Atoms for signed permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.09805v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a natural analogue of weak Bruhat order on the involutions in any Coxeter group. The saturated chains of intervals in this order correspond to reduced words for a certain set of group elements called atoms. Brion gives a general formula for the cohomology class of a $K$-orbit closure in an arbitrary flag variety, where $K$ is a symmetric subgroup of a complex algebraic group. In type A, the terms in this formula are indexed by atoms for permutations. We study the combinatorics of atoms for involutions in the group of signed permutations. In particular, we give a compact description of the atom set for any signed involution and endow it with the structure of a graded poset. Our main result, as an application, is to identify explicitly the terms in Brion's cohomology formula in types B and C. These descriptions apply to all $K$-orbits in these types and are the first of their kind outside of type A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.07894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two simplicial complexes arising from a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with two chosen vertices $s$ and $t$: the *path-free complex*, consisting of all subsets $F \subseteq E$ that contain no path from $s$ to $t$, and the *path-missing complex*, its Alexander dual. Using discrete Morse theory, we prove that both complexes have well-behaved homotopy types -- either contractible or homotopy-equivalent to spheres.</description>

      <title>Classifying one-dimensional discrete models with maximum likelihood degree one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a classification of all one-dimensional discrete statistical models with maximum likelihood degree one based on their rational parametrization. We show how all such models can be constructed from members of a smaller class of 'fundamental models' using a finite number of simple operations. We introduce 'chipsplitting games', a class of combinatorial games on a grid which we use to represent fundamental models. This combinatorial perspective enables us to show that there are only finitely many fundamental models in the probability simplex $\Delta_n$ for $n\leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of sets of equiangular lines with common angle $\arccos(1/3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, Sz\"{o}ll\H{o}si and \"{O}sterg\r{a}rd used a computer to enumerate sets of equiangular lines with common angle $\arccos(1/3)$ in dimension $7$. They observed that the numbers $\omega(n)$ of sets of $n$ equiangular lines with common angle $\arccos(1/3)$ in dimension $7$ are almost symmetric around $n=14$. In this paper, we prove without a computer that the numbers $\omega(n)$ are indeed almost symmetric by considering isometries from root lattices of rank at most $8$ to the root lattice $\sE_8$ of rank $8$ and type $E$. Also, they determined the number $s(n)$ of sets of $n$ equiangular lines with common angle $\arccos(1/3)$ for $n \leq 13$. We construct all the sets of equiangular lines with common angle $\arccos(1/3)$ in dimension greater than $7$ from root lattices of type $A$ or $D$ with the aid of switching roots. As an application, we determine the number $s(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.</description>

      <title>The number of cliques in hypergraphs with forbidden subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the maximum number of $r$-vertex cliques in $(r-1)$-uniform hypergraphs not containing complete $r$-partite hypergraphs $K_r^{(r-1)}(a_1, \dots, a_r)$. By using the hypergraph removal lemma, we show that this maximum is $o( n^{r - 1/(a_1 \cdots a_{r-1})} )$. This immediately implies the corresponding results of Mubayi and Mukherjee and of Balogh, Jiang, and Luo for graphs. We also provide a lower bound by using hypergraph Tur\'an numbers.</description>

      <title>Genus distribution polynomials for bicellular bicolored maps all with real zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enumerating bicolored maps and maps according to the numbers (and possibly types) of edges, faces, white vertices, black vertices and genus has been an important topic arising in many fields of mathematics and physics. In particular, Jackson (1987), Zagier (1995) and Stanley (2011) respectively obtained some expressions for the generating polynomial of the numbers of one-face bicolored maps with given number of edges and white vertex degree distribution while tracking the number of black vertices. The cases for multiple faces are harder. In this paper,
  we first obtain the number for that of bicolored maps with two faces, i.e., bicellular, of arbitrary length distribution, and then derive an explicit formula for the corresponding generating polynomial with respect to genus. We next prove that the generating polynomial essentially has only real zeros and thus the genus distribution is log-concave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any power series with unit constant term can be factored into an infinite product of the form $\prod_{n\geq 1} (1-q^n)^{-a_n}$. We give direct formulas for the exponents $a_n$ in terms of the coefficients of the power series, and vice versa, as sums over partitions. As examples, we prove identities for certain partition enumeration functions. Finally, we note $q$-analogues of our enumeration formulas.</description>

      <title>Invariant theory for wreath products acting on superpolynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite group $G$ acting linearly on the variables $V$ of a polynomial algebra, or an exterior algebra, or superpolynomial algebra with both commuting and anticommuting variables. In this setting, the Hilbert series for the $G$-invariant subalgebra turns out to determine the analogous Hilbert series for the wreath product $P[G]$ acting on $V^n$ for any permutation group $P$ inside the symmetric group $S_n$ on $n$ letters.
  This leads to a structural result: one can collate the direct sum for all $n$ of the $S_n[G]$-invariant subalgebras to form a graded ring via an external shuffle product, whose structure turns out to be a superpolynomial algebra generated by the $G$-invariants. A parallel statement holds for the direct sum of all $S_n[G]$-antiinvariants, which forms a graded ring via an external signed shuffle product, isomorphic to the superexterior algebra generated by the $G$-invariants.</description>

Abstract: A graph is said to be orthogonalisable if the set of real symmetric matrices whose off-diagonal pattern is prescribed by its edges contains an orthogonal matrix. We determine some necessary and some sufficient conditions on the sizes of the connected components of two graphs for their join to be orthogonalisable. In some cases, those conditions coincide, and we present several families of joins of graphs that are orthogonalisable.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Combinatorial Riemann Boundary Value Problem and Lattice Walks Avoiding a Quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework of matrix-form combinatorial Riemann boundary value problem (cRBVP) to characterize the integrability of functional equations arising in lattice walk enumerations. A matrix cRBVP is defined as integrable if it can be reduced to enough polynomial equations with one catalytic variable. Our central results establish that the integrability depends on the eigenspace of some matrix associated to the problem. For lattice walks in three quadrants, we demonstrate how the obstinate kernel method transforms a discrete difference equation into a $3\times 3$ matrix cRBVP. The special double-roots eigenvalue $1/4$ yields two independent polynomial equations in the problem. The other single-root eigenvalue yields a linear equation. We obtain three independent equations from a $3\times 3$ system. Crucially, our framework generalizes three-quadrant walks with Weyl symmetry to models satisfying only orbit-sum conditions. It explains many criteria about the orbit-sum proposed by various researchers and it also explains the counter-example of lattice walks starting outside the quadrant.</description>

      <title>A Counterexample to a Conjecture of Lov\'asz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1975 Lov\'{a}sz conjectured that every $r$-partite, $r$-uniform hypergraph contains $r-1$ vertices whose deletion reduces the matching number. If true, this statement would imply a well-known conjecture of Ryser from 1971, which states that every $r$-partite, $r$-uniform hypergraph has a vertex cover of size at most $r-1$ times its matching number. When $r=2$, Ryser's conjecture is simply K\H{o}nig's theorem, and the conjecture of Lov\'asz is an immediate corollary. Ryser's conjecture for $r=3$ was proven by Aharoni in 2001, and remains open for all $r\geq 4$.
  Here we show that the conjecture of Lov\'asz is false in the case $r=3$. Our counterexample is the line hypergraph of the Biggs-Smith graph, a highly symmetric cubic graph on 102 vertices.</description>

      <title>An example showing that Schrijver's $\vartheta$-function need not upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter addresses an open question concerning a variant of the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ function, which was introduced by Schrijver and independently by McEliece et al. (1978). The question of whether this variant provides an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph was explicitly stated by Bi and Tang (2019). This letter presents an explicit example of a Tanner graph on 32 vertices, which shows that, in contrast to the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ function, this variant does not necessarily upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph. The example, previously outlined by the author in a recent paper (2024), is presented here in full detail, making it easy to follow and verify. By resolving this question, the note clarifies a subtle but significant distinction between these two closely related graph invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bipartite independence number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$, is defined as the smallest integer $q$ for which there exist positive integers $s$ and $t$ with $s + t = q + 1$, such that for any two disjoint subsets $A, B \subseteq V(G)$ with $|A| = s$ and $|B| = t$, there exists an edge between $A$ and $B$. In this paper, we prove that for a 2-connected graph $G$ of order at least three, if $\max\{d_G(x), d_G(y)\} \ge \widetilde{\alpha}(G)$ for every pair of nonadjacent vertices $x, y$ at distance two, then $G$ is hamiltonian. Moreover, we prove that if $G$ is 3-connected and $\max\{d_G(x), d_G(y)\} \ge \widetilde{\alpha}(G)+1$ for every pair of nonadjacent vertices $x, y$ at distance two, then $G$ is hamiltonian-connected. Our results generalize the recent work by Li and Liu.</description>

Abstract: We identify a link between regular matroids and torus representations all of whose isotropy groups have an odd number of components. Applying Seymour's 1980 classification of the former objects, we obtain a classification of the latter. In addition, we prove optimal upper bounds for the cogirth of regular matroids up to rank nine, and we apply this to prove the existence of fixed-point sets of circles with large dimension in a torus representation with this property up to rank nine. Finally, we apply these results to prove new obstructions to the existence of Riemannian metrics with positive sectional curvature and torus symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special
  structures. In this series of two papers, we characterize entropy functions on the 2-dimensional faces of the polymatroidal region of degree 4. In Part I, we formulate the problem, enumerate all 59 types of 2-dimensional faces of the region by an algorithm, and fully characterize entropy functions on 49 types of them. Among them, those non-trivial cases are mainly characterized by the graph-coloring technique. The entropy functions on the remaining 10 types of faces will be characterized in Part II, among which 8 types are fully characterized, and 2 types are partially characterized.</description>

  Moreover, we show that for all $2\le k \le n$ a set $A$ avoiding $k$ pairwise orthogonal vectors has measure at most $\exp(-c_1 \min\{\sqrt{n}, n/k\})$ for some $c_1&gt;0$. Proofs rely on the harmonic analysis on the sphere and the hypercontractive inequality.</description>

      <title>Graphs with single interval Cayley configuration spaces in 3-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjectured graph theoretic characterization of a geometric property of 3 dimensional linkages posed 15 years ago by Sitharam and Gao, motivated by their equivalent characterization for $d\le 2$ that does not generalize to $d\ge 3$. A linkage $(G,\ell)$ contains a finite simple undirected graph $G$ and a map $\ell$ that assigns squared Euclidean lengths to the edges of $G$. A \emph{$d$-realization} of $(G,\ell)$ is an assignment of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the vertices of $G$ for which pairwise squared distances between points agree with $\ell$. For any positive integer $d \leq 3$, we characterize pairs $(G,f)$, where $f$ is a nonedge of $G$, such that, for any linkage $(G,\ell)$, the lengths attained by $f$ form a single interval - over the (typically a disconnected set of) $d$-realizations of $(G,\ell)$.
  Although related to the minor closed class of $d$-flattenable graphs, the class of pairs $(G,f)$ with the above property is not closed under edge deletions, has no obvious well quasi-ordering, and there are infinitely many minimal graph-nonedge pairs - with respect to edge contractions - in the complement class. Our characterization overcomes these obstacles, is based on the forbidden minors for $d$-flattenability for $d \leq 3$, and contributes to the theory of Cayley configurations with many applications. Helper results and corollaries provide new tools for reasoning about configuration spaces and completions of partial 3-tree linkages, (non)convexity of Euclidean measurement sets in $3$-dimensions, their projections, fibers and sections. Generalizations to higher dimensions and efficient algorithmic characterizations are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Community detection with the Bethe-Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Hessian matrix, introduced by Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014), is a Hermitian matrix designed for applying spectral clustering algorithms to sparse networks. Rather than employing a non-symmetric and high-dimensional non-backtracking operator, a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix is conjectured to also reach the Kesten-Stigum detection threshold in the sparse stochastic block model (SBM). We provide the first rigorous analysis of the Bethe-Hessian spectral method in the SBM under both the bounded expected degree and the growing degree regimes. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) When the expected degree $d\geq 2$, the number of negative outliers of the Bethe-Hessian matrix can consistently estimate the number of blocks above the Kesten-Stigum threshold, thus confirming a conjecture from Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014) for $d\geq 2$. (ii) For sufficiently large $d$, its eigenvectors can be used to achieve weak recovery. (iii) As $d\to\infty$, we establish the concentration of the locations of its negative outlier eigenvalues, and weak consistency can be achieved via a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic arithmetic progressions in the Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and Rudin-Shapiro words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the lengths and starting positions of the longest monochromatic arithmetic progressions for a fixed difference in the Fibonacci word. We provide a complete classification for their lengths in terms of a simple formula. Our strongest results are proved using methods from dynamical systems, especially the dynamics of circle rotations. We also employ computer-based methods in the form of the automatic theorem-proving software Walnut. This allows us to extend recent results concerning similar questions for the Thue-Morse word and the Rudin-Shapiro word. This also allows us to obtain some results for the Fibonacci word that do not seem to be amenable to dynamical methods.</description>

      <title>Transductions of Graph Classes Admitting Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a quest to thoroughly understand the first-order transduction hierarchy of hereditary graph classes, some questions in particular stand out; such as, what properties hold for graph classes that are first-order transductions of planar graphs (and of similar classes)? When addressing this (so-far wide open) question, we turn to the concept of a product structure - being a subgraph of the strong product of a path and a graph of bounded tree-width, introduced by Dujmovic et al. [JACM 2020]. Namely, we prove that any graph class which is a first-order transduction of a class admitting such product structure, up to perturbations also meets a structural description generalizing the concept of a product structure in a dense hereditary way - the latter concept being introduced just recently by Hlineny and Jedelsky under the name of H-clique-width [MFCS 2024]. Using this characterization, we show that the class of the 3D grids, as well as a class of certain modifications of 2D grids, are not first-order transducible from classes admitting a product structure, and in particular not from the class of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer between real pure states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>Coxeter codes: Extending the Reed-Muller family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary Reed-Muller (RM) codes are defined via evaluations of Boolean-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$. We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the RM family by replacing the domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Like RM codes, this class is closed under duality, forms a nested code sequence, satisfies a multiplication property, and has asymptotic rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. Coxeter codes also give rise to a family of quantum codes for which transversal diagonal $Z$ rotations can perform non-trivial logic.</description>
