      <title>KH-PINN: Physics-informed neural networks for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability with spatiotemporal and magnitude multiscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is crucial across various fields, requiring extensive high-fidelity data. However, experimental data are often sparse and noisy, while simulated data may lack credibility due to discrepancies with real-world configurations and parameters. This underscores the need for field reconstruction and parameter inference from sparse, noisy data, which constitutes inverse problems. Based on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the KH-PINN framework is established in this work to solve the inverse problems of KHI flows. By incorporating the governing physical equations, KH-PINN reconstructs continuous flow fields and infer unknown transport parameters from sparse, noisy observed data. The 2D unsteady incompressible flows with both constant and variable densities are studied. To our knowledge, this is the first application of PINNs to unsteady incompressible flows with variable densities. To address the spatiotemporal multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-scale structures, the multiscale embedding (ME) strategy is adopted. To address the magnitude multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-magnitude velocities, which are critical for KHI problems, the small-velocity amplification (SVA) strategy is proposed. The results demonstrate that KH-PINN can accurately reconstruct the fields with complex, evolving vortices and infer unknown parameters across a broad range of Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the energy-decaying and entropy-increasing curves are accurately obtained. The effectiveness of ME and SVA is validated through comparative studies, and the anti-noise and few-shot learning capabilities of KH-PINN are also validated. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/CAME-THU/KH-PINN.</description>

      <title>Differentially heated turbulent channel flow two-point correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the behavior of a differentially heated channel flow by means of a direct numerical simulations (DNS) with variable thermophysical properties under low-speed conditions focusing on the impact of the temperature gradient on the turbulence structures near the channel walls. The simulations were conducted at a mean friction Reynolds number of Re{\tau}m = 400 with a temperature ratio between the walls of Thot/Tcold = 2. Results show significant differences between the hot and cold walls that lead to an increased heat transfer at the hot wall and a higher turbulent production in the cold wall.</description>

      <title>A low-dissipation numerical method based on boundary variation diminishing principle for compressible gas-liquid two-phase flows with phase change on unstructured grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-dissipation numerical method for compressible gas-liquid two-phase flow with phase change on unstructured grids is proposed. The governing equations adopt the six-equation model. The non-conservative terms included in the volume fraction and total energy equations of the six-equation model are defined on cell boundaries using second-order accurate approximations and calculated without interpolating the spatial derivatives. To capture discontinuities such as contact discontinuities and gas-liquid interfaces with low dissipation, the MUSCL-THINC/QQ-BVD scheme, which combines the Monotone Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) method and the Tangent Hyperbola for INterface Capturing method with Quadratic surface representation and Gaussian Quadrature (THINC/QQ) method, is employed. The MUSCL method is one of the mainstream numerical solvers for compressible flows, achieving second-order accuracy for smooth solutions, but it introduces excessive numerical dissipation errors near discontinuous solutions. The THINC/QQ method uses a reconstruction function developed for interface capturing on unstructured grids, making use of a sigmoidal function with a quadratic surface. By combining these reconstruction functions according to the Boundary Variation Diminishing (BVD) principle, the MUSCL method is selected for smooth solutions, while the THINC/QQ method is chosen for discontinuous solutions, preserving the solution structure accurately. Several benchmark tests are solved, demonstrating that the MUSCL-THINC/QQ-BVD scheme not only captures contact discontinuities with low dissipation but also resolves dynamically generated gas-liquid interfaces due to phase changes clearly.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the Rayleigh-B\'enard system by injection of thermal inertial particles and bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of a dispersed particulate phase on the onset of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a fluid layer is studied theoretically by means of a two-fluid Eulerian modelization. The particles are non-Brownian, spherical, with inertia and heat capacity, and they interact with the surrounding fluid mechanically and thermally. We study both the cases of particles denser and lighter than the fluid that are injected uniformly at the system's horizontal boundaries with their settling terminal velocity and prescribed temperatures. The performed linear stability analysis shows that the onset of thermal convection is stationary, i.e., the system undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation as in the classical single-phase RB problem. Remarkably, the mechanical coupling due to the particle motion always stabilizes the system, increasing the critical Rayleigh number ($Ra_c$) of the convective onset. Furthermore, the particle to fluid heat capacity ratio provides an additional stabilizing mechanism, that we explore in full by addressing both the asymptotic limits of negligible and overwhelming particle thermal inertia. The overall resulting stabilization effect on $Ra_c$ is significant: for a particulate volume fraction of 0.1% it reaches up to a factor 30 for the case of the lightest particle density (i.e. bubbles) and 60 for the heaviest one. The present work extends the analysis performed by Prakhar &amp; Prosperetti (Phys. Rev. Fluids 6, 083901, 2021) where the thermo-mechanical stabilization effect has been first demonstrated for highly dense particles. Here, by including the effect of the added-mass force in the model system, we succeed in exploring the full range of particle densities. Finally, we critically discuss the role of the particle injection boundary conditions which are adopted in this study and how their modification may lead to different dynamics, that deserve to be studied in the future.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of Geomechanical Deformation, Fluid Flow and Reactive Transport in Shale Rough-Walled Microfractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving hydrocarbon production with hydraulic fracturing from unconventional reservoirs requires investigating transport phenomena at the single fracture level. In this study, we simulated geomechanical deformation, fluid flow, and reactive transport to understand the effect of hydraulic fracturing treatment on permeability evolution in shale rough-walled fractures. Using concepts of fractional Brownian motion and surface roughness characterizations with laser profilometer, we first generated three rough-walled microfractures consistent with three laboratory experiments (i.e., E4, E5 and E6). After that, the generated microfractures were subjected to a confining pressure in accord with experimental conditions, and geomechanical deformation was simulated. We used the OpenFOAM software package to simulate the fluid flow and permeability. By comparing the simulated permeability values with the experimentally measured ones we found relative errors equal to 28, 15 and 200% respectively for the experiments E4, E5 and E6. After calibration, however, the relative error dropped below 4%. We next simulated the reactive transport using the GeoChemFOAM solver and investigated permeability evolution in the deformed microfractures. We found that after 10 hrs of reactive transport simulations, permeability increased by 47%, on average, in all cases studied here.</description>

      <title>Modeling and scaling spontaneous imbibition with generalized fractional flow theory and non-Boltzmann transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous imbibition (SI) is a process by which liquid is drawn into partially saturated porous media by capillary forces, relevant for subsurface processes like underground fluid storage and withdrawal. Accurate modeling and scaling of counter-current SI have long been challenging. In this study, we proposed a generalized fractional flow theory (GFFT) using the Hausdorff fractal derivative, combined with non-Boltzmann scaling. The model links imbibition distance to time through the power law exponent alpha/2, where alpha is the fractal index (0 &lt; alpha &lt; 2 in this study). We applied the GFFT to various experimental and stimulated datasets of both porous and fractured media, finding that alpha varied with factors such as contact angle (of the imbibing fluid), dynamic viscosity, pore structure, and fracture properties. By analyzing SI data from sandstones, diatomite, carbonate, and synthetic porous media, we demonstrated that the non-Boltzmann scaling provided a better collapse of the SI data than the traditional Boltzmann approach alpha = 1), with alpha values ranging from 0.88 to 1.54. These deviations illustrate the model's adaptability to different porous materials. Using the GFFT, we expect to better predict fluid imbibition rates when properties like porosity, permeability, initial and maximum saturations, viscosity, and wettability are known, offering a more accurate alternative to traditional models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and structure-preservation in summation by parts methods for the moist compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moist thermodynamics is a fundamental driver of atmospheric dynamics across all scales, making accurate modeling of these processes essential for reliable weather forecasts and climate change projections. However, atmospheric models often make a variety of inconsistent approximations in representing moist thermodynamics. These inconsistencies can introduce spurious sources and sinks of energy, potentially compromising the integrity of the models.
  Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent and structure preserving formulation of the moist compressible Euler equations. When discretised with a summation by parts method, our spatial discretisation conserves: mass, water, entropy, and energy. These properties are achieved by discretising a skew symmetric form of the moist compressible Euler equations, using entropy as a prognostic variable, and the summation-by-parts property of discrete derivative operators. Additionally, we derive a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method with energy and tracer variance stable numerical fluxes, and experimentally verify our theoretical results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Wave reflections and resonance in a Mach 0.9 turbulent jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to provide a more complete understanding of the resonance mechanisms that occur in turbulent jets at high subsonic Mach number, as shown by Towne et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 825, 2017, pp. 1113-1152). Resonance was suggested by that study to exist between upstream- and downstream-travelling guided waves. Five possible resonance mechanisms were postulated, each involving different families of guided waves that reflect in the nozzle exit plane and at a number of downstream turning points. However, that study did not identify which of the five resonance mechanisms underpin the observed spectral peaks. In this work, the waves underpinning resonance are identified via a biorthogonal projection of Large Eddy Simulation data on eigenbases provided by a locally parallel linear stability analysis. Two of the five scenarios postulated by Towne et al. are thus confirmed to exist in the turbulent jet. The reflection-coefficients in the nozzle exit and turning-point planes are, furthermore, identified. Such information is required as input for simplified resonance-modelling strategies such as developed in Jordan et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 853, 2018, pp. 333-358) for jet-edge resonance, and in Mancinelli et al. (Exp. Fluids, vol. 60, 2019, pp. 1-9) for supersonic screech.</description>

      <title>A comparison of different approaches to compute surface tension contribution in incompressible two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Level-Set Method for free surface flow applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a solver using the Level-Set method for incompressible two phase flows with surface tension. A one fluid approach is adopted where both phases share the same velocity and pressure field. The Level Set method has been coupled with the Ghost Fluid Method. An efficient and pragmatic solution is proposed to avoid interface displacement during the reinitialization of the level-Set fields. A solver called LSFoam has been implemented in the OpenFOAM framework with consistent Rhie &amp; Chow interpolation. This solver has been tested on several test cases covering different scales and flow configurations: rising bubble test case, Rayleigh-Taylor instability simulations, Ogee spillway flow, 3D dambreak simulation with a square cylinder obstacle and KVLCC2 steady resistance calculations. Overall results are in excellent agreement with reference data and the present approach is very promising for moderate free surface deformations.</description>

      <title>On the fractal dimension of non-Newtonian Hele-Shaw flow subject to Saffman-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete numerical method based on the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) approach to simulate two-fluid Hele-Shaw flow subject to the Saffman-Taylor interfacial instability, in the case where the displaced fluid is non-Newtonian. Focusing on fluids for which the most relevant non-Newtonian aspect of the thin-gap flow is shear-thinning, we introduce a history-dependent aspect into the algorithm, modeling shear-rate-dependent fluid viscosity. The main finding is that the morphology of the emerging patterns, characterized by the fractal dimension, is modified in a nontrivial manner by the shear-thinning nature of the displaced fluid. In particular, we consistently find that shear-thinning leads to the formation of patterns characterized by a smaller fractal dimension, compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid.</description>

      <title>Duality of the Navier-Stokes dynamics and lack of finite-time explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the duality of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics in three dimensions, leading to its reformulation in terms of a one-dimensional momentum loop equation. \textbf{The momentum loop equation does not have finite-time blow-up solutions.} The decaying turbulence is a solution of this equation equivalent to a string theory with discrete target space made of regular star polygons and Ising degrees of freedom on the sides. This string theory is solvable in the turbulent limit, equivalent to the quasiclassical approximation in a nontrivial calculable background. \textbf{As a result, the spectrum of decay indexes is analytically computed, and it agrees very well with real and numerical experiments. } Among the decay indexes, there are complex conjugate pairs related to zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The Kolmogorov scaling laws are replaced by certain number theory functions, which are nonlinear in the log-log scale.</description>
