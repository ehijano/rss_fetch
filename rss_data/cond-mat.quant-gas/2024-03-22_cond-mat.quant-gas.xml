      <title>Self-Assembled Chains and Solids of Dipolar Atoms in a Multilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict that ultracold bosonic dipolar gases, confined within a multilayer geometry, may undergo self-assembling processes, leading to the formation of chain gases and solids. These dipolar chains, with dipoles aligned across different layers, emerge at low densities and resemble phases observed in liquid crystals, such as nematic and smectic phases. We calculate the phase diagram using quantum Monte Carlo methods, introducing a newly devised trial wave function designed for describing the chain gas, where dipoles from different layers form chains without in-plane long-range order. We find gas, solid, and chain phases, along with quantum phase transitions between these states. Specifically, we predict a quantum phase transition from a gaseous to a self-ordered phase, which occurs at a critical interlayer distance. Remarkably, in the self-organized phases, the mean interparticle distance can significantly exceed the characteristic length of the interaction potential, yielding solids and chain gases with densities several orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional quantum solids.</description>

      <title>Probing Goldstino excitation through the tunneling transport in a Bose-Fermi mixture with explicitly broken supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the tunneling transport in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. A two-terminal model is applied to such a mixture and the supersymmetric-like tunneling current through the junction can be induced by the bias of fermion chemical potential between two reservoirs. The Goldstino, which is the Nambu-Goldstone fermionic mode associated with the spontaneous sypersymmetry breaking and appears as a gapped mode in the presence of the explicit supersymmetry breaking in existing Bose-Fermi mixtures, is found to contribute to the tunneling transport as a supercharge exchanging process. Our study provides a potential way to detect the Goldstino transport in cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Miscibility-Immiscibility transition of strongly interacting bosonic mixtures in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant. Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square optical lattice. Particularly we examine the transition when both the components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF) or supersolid (SS) phases. Our study prevails that, similar to the contact interactions, the MIT can be influenced by competing intra and inter-component density induced tunnelings and off-site interactions. To probe the MIT in the strongly interacting regime, we study the extended version of the Bose-Hubbard model with the density induced tunneling and nearest-neighbouring interaction terms, and focus in the regime where the hopping processes are considerably weaker than the on-site interaction. We solve this model through site-decoupling mean-field theory with Gutzwiller ansatz and characterize the miscibility through the site-wise co-existence of the two-component across the lattice. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.</description>

      <title>dc atomtronic quantum interference device: quantum superposition of persistent-current states and a parity-protected qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized Bose-Hubbard model in a two-mode approximation is applied to study the rotational dynamics of a direct-current atomtronic quantum interference device. Modified values of on-site interaction and pair-tunneling parameters of the Hamiltonian, derived from the small-oscillation periods of the Josephson modes, are shown to provide an excellent agreement to the Gross-Pitaevskii simulation results for the whole rotational frequency range, reaching also the critical values of imbalance and current. This amounts to a full validation of the semiclassical approximation of the modified Hamiltonian, whose quantization is employed to investigate the quantum features of the stationary states. Focusing on the frequency interval where the potential energy presents two minima, it is shown that the central frequency, at which such minima are symmetric, yields an atom number parity-protected qubit with a maximum entanglement of both persistent-current states, similar to those of superconducting circuits threaded by a half-quantum of applied flux. Such a parity protection scheme survives within a small interval around the central frequency, which sets the minimum rotational frequency precision that should be required to implement the qubit. It is found that such a maximum admissible error in the frequency determination turns out to be inversely proportional to the qubit quality factor that measures the gap between the qubit energy levels and the following levels. It is shown that the chemical potential or condensate particle number could be employed as suitable control parameters to achieve the best trade-off between such qubit characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a Bose--Einstein Condensate illuminated by a far off-resonant optical pump field and its retroreflection from a feedback mirror can produce stable, localised structures known as optomechanical droplets. We show that these droplets could be used to measure the acceleration of a BEC via continuous monitoring of the position of the droplet via the optical intensity distribution.</description>

      <title>Anomaly in open quantum systems and its implications on mixed-state quantum phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic way to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework and calculate their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed.
  Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial long-time dynamics, specifically steady states of Lindbladians, in open quantum systems. Notably, we identify a new exotic phase in $(1+1)$-D where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We discuss the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Quantum Quench in Dipole-constrained Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quench dynamics in the dipolar Bose-Hubbard model (DBHM) in one dimension. The boson hopping is constrained by dipole conservation and show fractonic dynamics. The ground states at large Hubbard interaction $U$ are Mott insulators at integer filling and a period-2 charge density wave (CDW) at half-integer filling. We focus on Mott-to-Mott and CDW-to-CDW quenches and find that dipole correlation spreading shows the light-cone behavior with the Lieb-Robinson (LR) velocity proportional to the dipole kinetic energy $J$ and the square of the density in the case of Mott quench at integer filling. Effective model for post-quench dynamics is constructed under the dilute-dipole approximation and fits the numerical results well. For CDW quench we observe a much reduced LR velocity of order $J^2/U$ and additional periodic features in the time direction. The emergence of CDW ground state and the reduced LR velocity at half-integer filling can both be understood by careful application of the second-order perturbation theory. The oscillatory behavior arises from quantum scars in the quadrupole sector of the spectrum and is captured by a PXP-like model that we derive by projecting the DBHM to the quadrupolar sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Exact hole-induced $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in certain $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the motion of a single hole induces $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in the $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ (Fermi) Hubbard model on a Husimi-like tree graph. The result is also generalized to certain $t$-$J$ models with antiferromagnetic interactions and singlet hopping terms typically neglected in the literature. This is an $SU(N)$ generalization of the "counter-Nagaoka theorem" introduced in [Phys. Rev. B 107, L140401 (2023)]. Our results suggest the existence of antiferromagnetic or resonating-valence-bond (RVB)-like polarons in the $t$-$J$ models on a more realistic non-bipartite lattice. Such antiferromagnetic/RVB polarons may be relevant for a novel strong-coupling mechanism of superconductivity or other exotic fractionalized phases of matter.</description>

      <title>A method to discriminate between localized and chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study whether a generic isolated quantum system initially set out of equilibrium can be considered as localized close to its initial state. Our approach considers the time evolution in the Krylov basis, which maps the dynamics onto that of a particle moving in a one-dimensional lattice where both the energy in the lattice sites and the tunneling from one lattice site to the next are inhomogeneous. By tying the dynamical propagation in the Krylov basis to that in the basis of microstates, we infer qualitative criteria to distinguish systems that remain localized close to their initial state from systems that undergo quantum thermalization. These criteria are system-dependent and involve the expectation values and standard deviations of both the coupling strengths between Krylov states and their energy. We verify their validity by inspecting two cases: Anderson localization as a function of dimension and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body dipolar spin system. We finally investigate the Wigner surmise and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which have both been proposed to characterize quantum chaotic systems. We show that when the average value of the non-diagonal terms in the Lanczos matrix is large compared to their fluctuations and to the fluctuations of the energy expectation values, which typically corresponds to delocalized quantum systems according to our criteria, there can be level repulsion of eigen-energies (also known as spectral rigidity), similar to that of the Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy levels; and we also demonstrate that in the same regime, the expectation values of typical local observables only weakly vary as a function of eigenstates, an important condition for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Our demonstration assumes that, in the chaotic regime, the observable is sufficiently diagonal in the basis of Krylov states.</description>

      <title>Probing Chiral-Symmetric Higher-Order Topological Insulators with Multipole Winding Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between crystalline symmetry and band topology gives rise to unprecedented lower-dimensional boundary states in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). However, the measurement of the topological invariants of HOTIs remains a significant challenge. Here, we define a {multipole winding number} (MWN) for chiral-symmetric HOTIs by applying a corner twisted boundary condition. The MWN, arising from both bulk and boundary states, accurately captures the bulk-corner correspondence including boundary-obstructed topological phases. To address the measurement challenge, we leverage the perturbative nature of the corner twisted boundary condition and develop a real-space approach for determining the MWN in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. The real-space formula provides an experimentally viable strategy for directly probing the topology of chiral-symmetric HOTIs through dynamical evolution. Our findings not only highlight the twisted boundary condition as a powerful tool for investigating HOTIs, but also establish a paradigm for exploring real-space formulas for the topological invariants of HOTIs.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e., spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.</description>

      <title>Signatures of metal to insulator crossover in the repulsive Fermi Hubbard model through static correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold atom systems provide a rich platform to realize strongly interacting condensed matter systems, and recent progress in fluorescence imaging technique has enabled identification of nontrivial doublon, singlon, and holon correlation functions. We show that these correlators can be used to identify the conditions under which local moments form in an interacting electronic system. Toward this end, we report a Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) study of such correlation functions in the two-dimensional repulsive Fermi Hubbard model on a square lattice as a function of doping, interaction strength and temperature. We find definite signatures of the crossover from small U(band regime) to large U(correlated insulator regime). Our key findings are: (1) An opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states is accompanied by the appearance of temperature insensitive points in the equation of state at finite doping, which can be used to distinguish the band regime in cold atom experiments. (2) Nearest neighbor doublon holon correlations track the opening of charge gap; these compete with density correlations to generate moment moment correlations that show different behavior in the metallic and correlated insulator regime. (3) Non local correlation functions can be used to distinguish between the two regimes, both at and away from half filling. Our results allow comparisons of different correlation functions with recent experimental findings and guide further experimental investigations.</description>
