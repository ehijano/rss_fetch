      <title>Efficient Dynamic Image Reconstruction with motion estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic inverse problems are challenging to solve due to the need to identify and incorporate appropriate regularization in both space and time. Moreover, the very large scale nature of such problems in practice presents an enormous computational challenge.
  In this work, in addition to the use of edge-enhancing regularization of spatial features, we propose a new regularization method that incorporates a temporal model that estimates the motion of objects in time. In particular, we consider the optical flow model that simultaneously estimates the motion and provides an approximation for the desired image, and we incorporate this information into the cost functional as an additional form of temporal regularization. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm to solve the jointly regularized problem that leverages a generalized Krylov subspace method. We illustrate the effectiveness of the prescribed approach on a wide range of numerical experiments, including limited angle and single-shot computerized tomography.</description>

      <title>A Finite Element Implementation of the SRTD Algorithm for an Oldroyd 3-Parameter Viscoelastic Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a finite element implementation of the SRTD algorithm described by Girault and Scott for the steady-state case of a certain 3-parameter subset of the Oldroyd models. We compare it to the well-known EVSS method, which, though originally described for the upper-convected Maxwell model, can easily accommodate the Oldroyd 3-parameter model. We obtain numerical results for both methods on two benchmark problems: the lid-driven cavity problem and the journal-bearing, or eccentric rotating cylinders, problem. We find that the resulting finite element implementation of SRTD is stable with respect to mesh refinement and is generally faster than EVSS, though is not capable of reaching as high a Weissenberg number as EVSS.</description>

      <title>Conservative, pressure-equilibrium-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method for compressible, multicomponent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns preservation of velocity and pressure equilibria in smooth, compressible, multicomponent flows in the inviscid limit. First, we derive the velocity-equilibrium and pressure-equilibrium conditions of a standard discontinuous Galerkin method that discretizes the conservative form of the compressible, multicomponent Euler equations. We show that under certain constraints on the numerical flux, the scheme is velocity-equilibrium-preserving. However, standard discontinuous Galerkin schemes are not pressure-equilibrium-preserving. Therefore, we introduce a discontinuous Galerkin method that discretizes the pressure-evolution equation in place of the total-energy conservation equation. Semidiscrete conservation of total energy, which would otherwise be lost, is restored via the correction terms of [Abgrall, J. Comput. Phys., 372, 2018, pp. 640-666] and [Abgrall et al., J. Comput. Phys., 453, 2022, 110955]. Since the addition of the correction terms prevents exact preservation of pressure and velocity equilibria, we propose modifications that then lead to a velocity-equilibrium-preserving, pressure-equilibrium-preserving, and (semidiscretely) energy-conservative discontinuous Galerkin scheme, although there are certain tradeoffs. Additional extensions are also introduced. We apply the developed scheme to smooth, interfacial flows involving mixtures of thermally perfect gases initially in pressure and velocity equilibria to demonstrate its performance in one, two, and three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving parametric finite element methods for anisotropic surface diffusion flow with minimal deformation formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High mesh quality plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of solutions in geometric flow problems. Duan and Li [Duan &amp; Li, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 46 (1) (2024) A587-A608] applied the minimal deformation (MD) formulation to propose an artificial tangential velocity determined by harmonic mapping to improve mesh quality. In this work, we extend the method to anisotropic surface diffusion flows, which, similar to isotropic curvature flow, also preserves excellent mesh quality. Furthermore, developing a numerical algorithm for the flow with MD formulation that guarantees volume conservation and energy stability remains a challenging task. We, in this paper, successfully construct several structure-preserving algorithms, including first-order and high-order temporal discretization methods. Extensive numerical experiments show that our methods effectively preserve mesh quality for anisotropic SDFs, ensuring high-order temporal accuracy, volume conservation or/and energy stability.</description>

      <title>A quantitative comparison of high-order asymptotic-preserving and asymptotically-accurate IMEX methods for the Euler equations with non-ideal gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative comparison between two different Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) approaches for the Euler equations of gas dynamics, specifically tailored for the low Mach limit. In this regime, a classical IMEX-RK approach involves an implicit coupling between the momentum and energy balance so as to avoid the acoustic CFL restriction, while the density can be treated in a fully explicit fashion. This approach leads to a mildly nonlinear equation for the pressure, which can be solved according to a fixed point procedure. An alternative strategy consists of employing a semi-implicit temporal integrator based on IMEX-RK methods (SI-IMEX-RK). The stiff dependence is carefully analyzed, so as to avoid the solution of a nonlinear equation for the pressure also for equations of state (EOS) of non-ideal gases. The spatial discretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which naturally allows high-order accuracy. The asymptotic-preserving (AP) and the asymptotically-accurate (AA) properties of the two approaches are assessed on a number of classical benchmarks for ideal gases and on their extension to non-ideal gases.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Implicit Runge-Kutta Methods for Stochastic Poisson Systems with Multiple Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta methods and transformed Runge-Kutta methods for stochastic Poisson systems with multiple noises. We prove that the first methods can preserve the Poisson structure, Casimir functions, and quadratic Hamiltonian functions in the case of constant structure matrix. Darboux-Lie theorem combined with coordinate transformation is used to construct the transformed Runge-Kutta methods for the case of non-constant structure matrix that preserve both the Poisson structure and the Casimir functions. Finally, through numerical experiments on stochastic rigid body systems and linear stochastic Poisson systems, the structure-preserving properties of the proposed two kinds of numerical methods are effectively verified.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear reduction strategies for data compression: a comprehensive comparison from diffusion to advection problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an overview of several nonlinear reduction strategies for data compression from various research fields, and a comparison of their performance when applied to problems characterized by diffusion and/or advection terms. We aim to create a common framework by unifying the notation referring to a common two-stage pipeline. At the same time, we underline their main differences and objectives by highlighting the diverse choices made for each stage. We test the considered approaches on three test cases belonging to the family of Advection-Diffusion problems, also focusing on the pure Advection and pure Diffusion benchmarks, studying their reducibility while varying the latent dimension. Finally, we interpret the numerical results under the lens of the discussed theoretical considerations, offering a comprehensive landscape for nonlinear reduction methods for general Advection-Diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Systems of ODEs Parameters Estimation by Using Stochastic Newton-Raphson and Gradient Descent Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to describe the time evolution of natural phenomena across various scientific fields. Estimating the parameters of these systems from data is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with nonlinear and high-dimensional models. In this paper, we propose novel methodologies for parameter estimation in systems of ODEs by using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method and Gradient Descent (GD) method. By leveraging the discrete derivative and Taylor expansion, the problem is formulated in a way that enables the application of both methods, allowing for flexible, efficient solutions. Additionally, we extend these approaches to stochastic versions - Stochastic Newton-Raphson (SNR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) - to handle large-scale systems with reduced computational cost. The proposed methods are evaluated by using numerical examples, including both linear and nonlinear parameter models, and compare the results to the well-known Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) method. While NR converges rapidly to the optimal solution, GD demonstrates robustness in handling chaotic systems, though it may occasionally lead to suboptimal results. Overall, the proposed methods provide improved accuracy in parameter estimation for ODE systems, outperforming NLS in terms of error metrics such as bias, mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination R2. These methods offer a valuable tool for fitting ODE models, particularly in scenarios involving big data and complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>A function approximation algorithm using multilevel active subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Active Subspace (AS) method is a widely used technique for identifying the most influential directions in high-dimensional input spaces that affect the output of a computational model. The standard AS algorithm requires a sufficient number of gradient evaluations (samples) of the input output map to achieve quasi-optimal reconstruction of the active subspace, which can lead to a significant computational cost if the samples include numerical discretization errors which have to be kept sufficiently small. To address this issue, we propose a multilevel version of the Active Subspace method (MLAS) that utilizes samples computed with different accuracies and yields different active subspaces across accuracy levels, which can match the accuracy of single-level AS with reduced computational cost, making it suitable for downstream tasks such as function approximation. In particular, we propose to perform the latter via optimally-weighted least-squares polynomial approximation in the different active subspaces, and we present an adaptive algorithm to choose dynamically the dimensions of the active subspaces and polynomial spaces. We demonstrate the practical viability of the MLAS method with polynomial approximation through numerical experiments based on random partial differential equations (PDEs).</description>

      <title>A spline-based hexahedral mesh generator for patient-specific coronary arteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a spline-based hexahedral mesh generator for tubular geometries commonly encountered in haemodynamics studies, in particular coronary arteries. We focus on techniques for accurately meshing stenoses and non-planar bifurcations. Our approach incorporates several innovations, including a spline-based description of the vessel geometry in both the radial and the longitudinal directions, and the use of Hermite curves for modeling non-planar bifurcations. This method eliminates the need for a concrete vessel surface, grid smoothing, and other post-processing techniques. A generalization to non-planar intersecting branches is discussed. We validate the generated meshes using commonly-employed quality indices and present numerical results with physiological boundary conditions, demonstrating the potential of the proposed framework. Patient-specific geometries are reconstructed from invasive coronary angiographies performed in the Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 2 (FAME 2) trial.</description>

      <title>Algorithms of very high space-time orders of accuracy for hyperbolic equations in the semidiscrete WENO-DeC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a deep investigation of a family of arbitrary high order numerical methods for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), with particular emphasis on very high order versions, i.e., with order higher than 5. More in detail, within the context of a generic Finite Volume (FV) semidiscretization, we consider Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization.The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we want to demonstrate the possibility of utilizing very high order schemes in concrete situations and highlight the related advantages. On the other one, we want to debunk the myth according to which, in the context of numerical resolution of hyperbolic PDEs with very high order spatial discretizations, the adoption of lower order time discretizations, e.g., strong stability preserving (SSP) or linearly strong stability preserving ($\lSSP$) Runge--Kutta (RK) schemes, does not affect the overall accuracy of the resulting approach and consequently its computational efficiency. Numerical results are reported for the linear advection equation (LAE) and for the Euler equations of fluid dynamics, showing the advantages and the critical aspects of the adoption of very high order numerical methods. Overall, the results indicate the potential for their use in real--life applications, offering advantages in terms of efficiency, such as requiring shorter computational times to achieve a prescribed error, even in problems involving discontinuities. Furthermore, the results confirm order degradation and efficiency loss when coupling very high order space discretizations with lower order SSPRK time discretizations.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical framework for the control of production-destruction differential systems. The general finite horizon optimal control problem is formulated and addressed through the dynamic programming approach. We develop a parallel in space conservative scheme for the corresponding backward-in-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Furthermore, we provide a suitable reconstruction algorithm for optimal controls and trajectories. The application to two case studies, specifically enzyme catalyzed biochemical reactions and infectious diseases, highlights the advantages of the proposed methodology over classical semi-Lagrangian discretizations.</description>

      <title>Euler--Poincar\'e reduction and the Kelvin--Noether theorem for discrete mechanical systems with advected parameters and additional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler--Poincar\'e equations, firstly introduced by Henri Poincar\'e in 1901, arise from the application of Lagrangian mechanics to systems on Lie groups that exhibit symmetries, particularly in the contexts of classical mechanics and fluid dynamics. These equations have been extended to various settings, such as semidirect products, advected parameters, and field theory, and have been widely applied to mechanics and physics. In this paper, we introduce the discrete Euler--Poincar\'e reduction for discrete Lagrangian systems on Lie groups with advected parameters and additional dynamics, utilizing the group difference map technique. Specifically, the group difference map is defined using either the Cayley transform or the matrix exponential. The continuous and discrete Kelvin--Noether theorems are extended accordingly, that account for Kelvin--Noether quantities of the corresponding continuous and discrete Euler--Poincar\'e equations. As an application, we show both continuous and discrete Euler--Poincar\'e formulations about the dynamics of underwater vehicles, followed by numerical simulations. Numerical results illustrate the scheme's ability to preserve geometric properties over extended time intervals, highlighting its potential for practical applications in the control and navigation of underwater vehicles, as well as in other domains.</description>

      <title>Uniform relations between the Gauss-Legendre nodes and weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four different relations between the Legendre nodes and weights are presented which, unlike the circle and trapezoid theorems for Gauss-Legendre quadrature, hold uniformly in the whole interval $(-1,1)$. These properties are supported by strong asymptotic evidence. The study of these results was originally motivated by the role some of them play in certain finite difference schemes used in the discretization of the angular Fokker-Planck diffusion operator.</description>

      <title>Second-order flows for approaching stationary points of a class of non-convex energies via convex-splitting schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the exploration of a recently introduced computational paradigm known as second-order flows, which are characterized by novel dissipative hyperbolic partial differential equations extending accelerated gradient flows to energy functionals defined on Sobolev spaces, and exhibiting significant performance particularly for the minimization of non-convex energies. Our approach hinges upon convex-splitting schemes, a tool which is not only pivotal for clarifying the well-posedness of second-order flows, but also yields a versatile array of robust numerical schemes through temporal (and spatial) discretization. We prove the convergence to stationary points of such schemes in the semi-discrete setting. Further, we establish their convergence to time-continuous solutions as the timestep tends to zero. Finally, these algorithms undergo thorough testing and validation in approaching stationary points of representative non-convex variational models in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>A stochastic perturbation approach to nonlinear bifurcating problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating probabilistic terms in mathematical models is crucial for capturing and quantifying uncertainties in real-world systems. However, stochastic models typically require large computational resources to produce meaningful statistics. For this reason, the development of reduction techniques becomes essential for enabling efficient and scalable simulations of complex scenarios while quantifying the underlying uncertainties. In this work, we study the accuracy of Polynomial Chaos (PC) surrogate expansion of the probability space on a bifurcating phenomenon in fluid dynamics, namely the Coanda effect. In particular, we propose a novel non-deterministic approach to generic bifurcation detection problems, where the stochastic setting provides a different perspective on the non-uniqueness of the solution, also avoiding expensive simulations for many instances of the parameter. Thus, starting from the formulation of the Spectral Stochastic Finite Element Method (SSFEM), we extend the methodology to deal with solutions of a bifurcating problem, by working with a perturbed version of the deterministic model. We discuss the link between deterministic and stochastic bifurcation diagrams, highlighting the surprising capability of PC polynomial coefficients to give insights into the deterministic solution manifold.</description>

      <title>Finite element approximation of parabolic SPDEs with Whittle--Mat\'ern noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new type of fully discrete finite element approximation of a class of linear stochastic parabolic evolution equations with additive noise. Our discretization differs from previous ones in that we use a finite element approximation of the noise, as opposed to an $L^2$ projection. This approximation is tailored for equations where the noise has covariance operator defined in terms of (negative powers of) elliptic operators, like Whittle--Mat\'ern random fields. Strong convergence rates up to order $2$ in space and $1$ in time are shown and verified by numerical experiments in dimension $1$ and $2$.</description>

      <title>A new rational approximation algorithm via the empirical interpolation method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new rational approximation algorithm based on the empirical interpolation method for interpolating a family of parametrized functions to rational polynomials with invariant poles, leading to efficient numerical algorithms for space-fractional differential equations, parameter-robust preconditioning, and evaluation of matrix functions. Compared to classical rational approximation algorithms, the proposed method is more efficient for approximating a large number of target functions. In addition, we derive a convergence estimate of our rational approximation algorithm using the metric entropy numbers. Numerical experiments are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A uniquely solvable and positivity-preserving finite difference scheme for the Flory-Huggins-Cahn-Hilliard equation with dynamical boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and analyze a finite difference numerical scheme for the Flory-Huggins-Cahn-Hilliard equation with dynamical boundary condition. The singular logarithmic potential is included in the Flory-Huggins energy expansion. Meanwhile, a dynamical evolution equation for the boundary profile corresponds to a lower-dimensional singular energy potential. In turn, a theoretical analysis for the coupled system becomes very challenging, since it contains nonlinear and singular energy potentials for both the interior region and on the boundary. In the numerical design, a convex splitting approach is applied to the chemical potential associated with the energy both at the interior region and on the boundary: implicit treatments for the singular and logarithmic terms, as well as the surface diffusion terms, combined with an explicit treatment for the concave expansive term. In addition, the discrete boundary condition for the phase variable is coupled with the evolutionary equation of the boundary profile. The resulting numerical system turns out to be highly nonlinear, singular and coupled. A careful finite difference approximation and convexity analysis reveals that such a numerical system could be represented as a minimization of a discrete numerical energy functional, which contains both the interior and boundary integrals. More importantly, all the singular terms correspond to a discrete convex functional. As a result, a unique solvability and positivity-preserving analysis could be theoretically justified, based on the subtle fact that the singular nature of the logarithmic terms around the singular limit values prevent the numerical solutions reaching these values. The total energy stability analysis could be established by a careful estimate over the finite difference inner product. Some numerical results are presented in this article.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.
  In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</description>

Abstract: Lee and Seung (2000) introduced numerical solutions for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) using iterative multiplicative update algorithms. These algorithms have been actively utilized as dimensionality reduction tools for high-dimensional non-negative data and learning algorithms for artificial neural networks. Despite a considerable amount of literature on the applications of the NMF algorithms, detailed explanations about their formulation and derivation are lacking. This report provides supplementary details to help understand the formulation and derivation of the proofs as used in the original paper.</description>

      <title>Coseparable Nonnegative Tensor Factorization With T-CUR Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an important unsupervised learning method to extract meaningful features from data. To address the NMF problem within a polynomial time framework, researchers have introduced a separability assumption, which has recently evolved into the concept of coseparability. This advancement offers a more efficient core representation for the original data. However, in the real world, the data is more natural to be represented as a multi-dimensional array, such as images or videos. The NMF's application to high-dimensional data involves vectorization, which risks losing essential multi-dimensional correlations. To retain these inherent correlations in the data, we turn to tensors (multidimensional arrays) and leverage the tensor t-product. This approach extends the coseparable NMF to the tensor setting, creating what we term coseparable Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF). In this work, we provide an alternating index selection method to select the coseparable core. Furthermore, we validate the t-CUR sampling theory and integrate it with the tensor Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (t-DEIM) to introduce an alternative, randomized index selection process. These methods have been tested on both synthetic and facial analysis datasets. The results demonstrate the efficiency of coseparable NTF when compared to coseparable NMF.</description>

      <title>Statistical algorithms for low-frequency diffusion data: A PDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of making nonparametric inference in a class of multi-dimensional diffusions in divergence form, from low-frequency data. Statistical analysis in this setting is notoriously challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood and its gradient, and computational methods have thus far largely resorted to expensive simulation-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new computational approach which is motivated by PDE theory and is built around the characterisation of the transition densities as solutions of the associated heat (Fokker-Planck) equation. Employing optimal regularity results from the theory of parabolic PDEs, we prove a novel characterisation for the gradient of the likelihood. Using these developments, for the nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the diffusivity, we then show that the numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient can be reduced to standard elliptic eigenvalue problems, solvable by powerful finite element methods. This enables the efficient implementation of a large class of popular statistical algorithms, including (i) preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and Langevin-type methods for posterior sampling, and (ii) gradient-based descent optimisation schemes to compute maximum likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimates. We showcase the effectiveness of these methods via extensive simulation studies in a nonparametric Bayesian model with Gaussian process priors, in which both the proposed optimisation and sampling schemes provide good numerical recovery.
