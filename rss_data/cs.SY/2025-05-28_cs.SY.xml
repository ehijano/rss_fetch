      <title>Design and Analysis of a Grid-connected DC Fast Charging Station for Dhaka-Chittagong Highway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates the development of efficient and reliable charging infrastructure, particularly fast charging stations (FCS) for addressing challenges such as range anxiety and long charging times. This paper presents the design and feasibility analysis of a grid-connected DC fast charging station for the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, a critical transportation corridor in Bangladesh. The proposed system incorporates advanced components, including a step-down transformer, Vienna Rectifier, and LC filter, to convert high-voltage AC power from the grid into a stable DC output. Simulated using MATLAB Simulink, the model delivers a peak output of 400V DC and 120 kW power, enabling rapid and efficient EV charging. The study also evaluates the system's performance, analyzing charging times, energy consumption, and distance ranges for representative EVs. By addressing key technical, environmental, and economic considerations, this paper provides a comprehensive roadmap for deploying fast charging infrastructure, fostering EV adoption, and advancing sustainable transportation in Bangladesh.</description>

      <title>Convergent Anthropocene Systems-of-Systems: Overcoming the Limitations of System Dynamics with Hetero-functional Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complexity and interdependence of systems in the Anthropocene is essential for making informed decisions about societal challenges spanning geophysical, biophysical, sociocultural, and sociotechnical domains. This paper explores the potential of Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT) as a quantification tool for converting Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), stated in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), into dynamic simulations-offering a comprehensive alternative to System Dynamics (SD) for representing interdependent systems of systems in the Anthropocene. The two approaches are compared in terms of systems thinking abstractions, methodological flexibility, and their ability to represent dynamic, multi-functional systems. Through a comparative study, the Mono Lake system is simulated in Northern California using both SD, and MBSE and HFGT, to highlight technical, conceptual and analytical differences. The simulations show equivalent results. However, MBSE and HFGT provide distinct advantages in capturing the nuances of the system through a broader set of systems thinking abstractions and in managing adaptive, multi-functional system interactions. These strengths position MBSE and HFGT as a powerful and flexible approach for representing, modeling, analyzing, and simulating heterogeneous and complex systems-of-systems in the Anthropocene.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Tracking Perimeter Control for Two-region Macroscopic Traffic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the concept of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), perimeter control can alleviate network-level congestion by identifying critical intersections and regulating them effectively. Considering the time-varying nature of travel demand and the equilibrium of accumulation state, we extend the conventional set-point perimeter control (SPC) problem for the two-region MFD system as an optimal tracking perimeter control problem (OTPCP). Unlike the SPC schemes that stabilize the traffic dynamics to the desired equilibrium point, the proposed tracking perimeter control (TPC) scheme regulates the traffic dynamics to a desired trajectory in a differential framework. Due to the inherent network uncertainties, such as heterogeneity of traffic dynamics and demand disturbance, the system dynamics could be uncertain or even unknown. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach to solving the OTPCP without utilizing the well-calibrated system dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADP-based TPC. Compared with the SPC scheme, the proposed TPC scheme achieves a 20.01% reduction in total travel time and a 3.15% improvement in cumulative trip completion. Moreover, the proposed adaptive TPC approach can regulate the accumulation state under network uncertainties and demand disturbances to the desired time-varying equilibrium trajectory that aims to maximize the trip completion under a nominal demand pattern. These results validate the robustness of the adaptive TPC approach.</description>

      <title>Nonadaptive Output Regulation of Second-Order Nonlinear Uncertain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robust output regulation problem of second-order nonlinear uncertain systems with an unknown exosystem. Instead of the adaptive control approach, this paper resorts to a robust control methodology to solve the problem and thus avoid the bursting phenomenon. In particular, this paper constructs generic internal models for the steady-state state and input variables of the system. By introducing a coordinate transformation, this paper converts the robust output regulation problem into a nonadaptive stabilization problem of an augmented system composed of the second-order nonlinear uncertain system and the generic internal models. Then, we design the stabilization control law and construct a strict Lyapunov function that guarantees the robustness with respect to unmodeled disturbances. The analysis shows that the output zeroing manifold of the augmented system can be made attractive by the proposed nonadaptive control law, which solves the robust output regulation problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonadaptive internal model approach by its application to the control of the Duffing system.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Learning Framework to Solve the Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework to solve the infinite-horizon optimal control problem of nonlinear systems. In particular, since PINNs are generally able to solve a class of partial differential equations (PDEs), they can be employed to learn the value function of the infinite-horizon optimal control problem via solving the associated steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, an issue here is that the steady-state HJB equation generally yields multiple solutions; hence if PINNs are directly employed to it, they may end up approximating a solution that is different from the optimal value function of the problem. We tackle this by instead applying PINNs to a finite-horizon variant of the steady-state HJB that has a unique solution, and which uniformly approximates the optimal value function as the horizon increases. An algorithm to verify if the chosen horizon is large enough is also given, as well as a method to extend it -- with reduced computations and robustness to approximation errors -- in case it is not. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed technique works well with non-polynomial basis functions, does not require prior knowledge of a stabilizing controller, and does not perform iterative policy evaluations. Simulations are performed, which verify and clarify theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Online distributed optimization for spatio-temporally constrained real-time peer-to-peer energy trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of distributed renewable energy triggers the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market formations. To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Solving Economic Dispatch Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capability of off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) to solve the economic dispatch (ED) problem. ED is a hard-constrained optimization problem solved on a day-ahead timescale by grid operators to minimize electricity generation costs while accounting for physical and engineering constraints. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but these typically require either mathematical formulations, face convergence issues, or depend on extensive labeled data and training time. This work implements LLMs enhanced with reasoning capabilities to address the classic lossless ED problem. The proposed approach avoids the need for explicit mathematical formulations, does not suffer from convergence challenges, and requires neither labeled data nor extensive training. A few-shot learning technique is utilized in two different prompting contexts. The IEEE 118-bus system with 19 generation units serves as the evaluation benchmark. Results demonstrate that various prompting strategies enable LLMs to effectively solve the ED problem, offering a convenient and efficient alternative. Consequently, this approach presents a promising future solution for ED tasks, particularly when foundational power system models are available.</description>

      <title>Dynamic State-Feedback Control for LPV Systems: Ensuring Stability and LQR Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic state-feedback controller for polytopic linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems with constant input matrix. The controller employs a projected gradient flow method to continuously improve its control law and, under established conditions, converges to the optimal feedback gain of the corresponding linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem associated with constant parameter trajectories. We derive conditions for quadratic stability, which can be verified via convex optimization, to ensure exponential stability of the LPV system even under arbitrarily fast parameter variations. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the boundedness of the trajectories of the dynamic controller for any parameter trajectory and the convergence of its feedback gains to the optimal LQR gains for constant parameter trajectories. Furthermore, we show that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable for constant parameter trajectories under these conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the controller maintains stability and improves transient performance.</description>

      <title>A memristive model of spatio-temporal excitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a model of excitability that unifies the mechanism of an important neuronal property both in time and in space. As a starting point, we revisit both a key model of temporal excitability, proposed by Hodgkin and Huxley, and a key model of spatial excitability, proposed by Amari. We then propose a novel model that captures the temporal and spatial properties of both models. Our aim is to regard neuronal excitability as a property across scales, and to explore the benefits of modeling excitability with one and the same mechanism, whether at the cellular or the population level.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the data usage and predictive behavior of data-driven predictive control (DPC) with 1-norm regularization. Our analysis enables the offline removal of unused data and facilitates a comparison between the identified symmetric structure and data usage against prior knowledge of the true system. This comparison helps assess the suitability of the DPC scheme for effective control.</description>

      <title>A Multi-output Gaussian Process Regression with Negative Transfer Mitigation for Generating Boundary Test Scenarios of Multi-UAV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive sampling based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) has already been applied with considerable success to generate boundary test scenarios for multi-UAV systems (MUS). One of the key techniques in such researches is leveraging the accurate prediction of the MUS performance through GPR in different test scenarios. Due to the potential correlations among the multiple MUS performance metrics, current researches commonly utilize a multi-output GPR (MOGPR) to model the multiple performance metrics simultaneously. This approach can achieve a more accurate prediction, rather than modeling each metric individually. However, MOGPR still suffers from negative transfer. When the feature of one output variable is incorrectly learned by another, the models training process will be negatively affected, leading to a decline in prediction performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel adaptive regularization approach into the conventional MOGPR training process. Unlike existing regularization approaches for mitigating negative transfer in MOGPR, our method penalizes the inconsistencies among output-specific characteristic parameters using adaptively adjustable regularization weights. This mechanism helps each set of output parameters avoid local optima. Consequently, it yields simultaneous improvements in predictive accuracy across all outputs. Finally, we validate our approach on a numerical case and on a boundary test scenario generation case for a MUS multi-objectives search task.</description>

      <title>State Constrained Model Reference Adaptive Control with Input Amplitude and Rate Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) for uncertain multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant (LTI) plants with user-defined constraints on the plant states, input amplitude, and input rate. The proposed two-layer barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based control design considers the input and the input rate as states that are constrained using two BLFs in the first layer, while another BLF in the second layer constrains the plant states. The adaptive control law ensures that the plant states, input amplitude, and input rate remain within the user-defined safe sets despite unmatched bounded disturbances. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a feasible control policy are also provided. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first optimization-free method that imposes user-defined constraints on the state, input, and input rate and also provides verifiable feasibility conditions in the presence of parametric uncertainties and disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>State and Input Constrained Adaptive Tracking Control of Uncertain Euler-Lagrange Systems with Robustness and Feasibility Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive tracking controller for uncertain Euler-Lagrange (E-L) systems with user-defined state and input constraints in presence of bounded external disturbances. A barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is employed for state constraint satisfaction, integrated with a saturated controller that ensures the control input remains within pre-specified bounds. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first result on tracking control of state and input-constrained uncertain E-L systems that provides verifiable conditions for the existence of a feasible control policy. The efficacy of the proposed controller in terms of constraint satisfaction and tracking performance is demonstrated through simulation on a robotic manipulator system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel splitting algorithm is proposed for the numerical simulation of neuromorphic circuits. The algorithm is grounded in the operator-theoretic concept of monotonicity, which bears both physical and algorithmic significance. The splitting exploits this correspondence to translate the circuit architecture into the algorithmic architecture. The paper illustrates the many advantages of the proposed operator-theoretic framework over conventional numerical integration for the simulation of multiscale hierarchical events that characterize neuromorphic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Current trends and future directions in event-based control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The defining characteristic of event-based control is that feedback loops are only closed when indicated by a triggering condition that takes recent information about the system into account. This stands in contrast to periodic control where the feedback loop is closed periodically. Benefits of event-based control arise when sampling comes at a cost, which occurs, e.g., for Networked Control Systems or in other setups with resource constraints. A rapidly growing number of publications deals with event-based control. Nevertheless, some fundamental questions about event-based control are still unsolved. In this article, we provide an overview of current research trends in event-based control. We focus on results that aim for a better understanding of effects that occur in feedback loops with event-based control. Based on this summary, we identify important open directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Control of Continuous-Time LTI Systems via Non-Minimal Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes an approach to design output-feedback controllers for unknown continuous-time linear time-invariant systems using only input-output data from a single experiment. To address the lack of state and derivative measurements, we introduce non-minimal realizations whose states can be observed by filtering the available data. We first apply this concept to the disturbance-free case, formulating linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) from batches of sampled signals to design a dynamic, filter-based stabilizing controller. The framework is then extended to the problem of asymptotic tracking and disturbance rejection - in short, output regulation - by incorporating an internal model based on prior knowledge of the disturbance/reference frequencies. Finally, we discuss tuning strategies for a class of multi-input multi-output systems and illustrate the method via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Dexterous Control of an 11-DOF Redundant Robot for CT-Guided Needle Insertion With Task-Oriented Weighted Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsies are critical for diagnosing a range of conditions, including lung cancer, but present challenges such as limited in-bore space, prolonged procedure times, and radiation exposure. Robotic assistance offers a promising solution by improving needle trajectory accuracy, reducing radiation exposure, and enabling real-time adjustments. In our previous work, we introduced a redundant robotic platform designed for dexterous needle insertion within the confined CT bore. However, its limited base mobility restricts flexible deployment in clinical settings. In this study, we present an improved 11-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic system that integrates a 6-DOF robotic base with a 5-DOF cable-driven end-effector, significantly enhancing workspace flexibility and precision. With the hyper-redundant degrees of freedom, we introduce a weighted inverse kinematics controller with a two-stage priority scheme for large-scale movement and fine in-bore adjustments, along with a null-space control strategy to optimize dexterity. We validate our system through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy and enhanced manipulability in CT-guided procedures. The study provides a strong case for hyper-redundancy and null-space control formulations for robot-assisted needle biopsy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Power-Capping Metric Evaluation for Improving Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With high-performance computing systems now running at exascale, optimizing power-scaling management and resource utilization has become more critical than ever. This paper explores runtime power-capping optimizations that leverage integrated CPU-GPU power management on architectures like the NVIDIA GH200 superchip. We evaluate energy-performance metrics that account for simultaneous CPU and GPU power-capping effects by using two complementary approaches: speedup-energy-delay and a Euclidean distance-based multi-objective optimization method. By targeting a mostly compute-bound exascale science application, the Locally Self-Consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS), we explore challenging scenarios to identify potential opportunities for energy savings in exascale applications, and we recognize that even modest reductions in energy consumption can have significant overall impacts. Our results highlight how GPU task-specific dynamic power-cap adjustments combined with integrated CPU-GPU power steering can improve the energy utilization of certain GPU tasks, thereby laying the groundwork for future adaptive optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling payoffs in repeated games is one of the important topics in control theory of multi-agent systems. Recently proposed zero-determinant strategies enable players to unilaterally enforce linear relations between payoffs. Furthermore, based on the mathematics of zero-determinant strategies, regional payoff control, in which payoffs are enforced into some feasible regions, has been discovered in social dilemma situations. More recently, theory of payoff control was extended to multichannel games, where players parallelly interact with each other in multiple channels. However, properties of zero-determinant strategies specific to multichannel games are still not clear. In this paper, we elucidate properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games. First, we relate the existence condition of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games to that of zero-determinant strategies in each channel. We then show that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games requires the existence of zero-determinant strategies in some channels. This result implies that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games is tightly restricted by structure of games played in each channel.</description>

      <title>Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system.
  Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) are determined by the "diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the "off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dynamic Shielding for Parametric Safety Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shielding has emerged as a promising approach for ensuring safety of AI-controlled autonomous systems. The algorithmic goal is to compute a shield, which is a runtime safety enforcement tool that needs to monitor and intervene the AI controller's actions if safety could be compromised otherwise. Traditional shields are designed statically for a specific safety requirement. Therefore, if the safety requirement changes at runtime due to changing operating conditions, the shield needs to be recomputed from scratch, causing delays that could be fatal. We introduce dynamic shields for parametric safety specifications, which are succinctly represented sets of all possible safety specifications that may be encountered at runtime. Our dynamic shields are statically designed for a given safety parameter set, and are able to dynamically adapt as the true safety specification (permissible by the parameters) is revealed at runtime. The main algorithmic novelty lies in the dynamic adaptation procedure, which is a simple and fast algorithm that utilizes known features of standard safety shields, like maximal permissiveness. We report experimental results for a robot navigation problem in unknown territories, where the safety specification evolves as new obstacles are discovered at runtime. In our experiments, the dynamic shields took a few minutes for their offline design, and took between a fraction of a second and a few seconds for online adaptation at each step, whereas the brute-force online recomputation approach was up to 5 times slower.</description>

      <title>Learning to Pursue AC Optimal Power Flow Solutions with Feasibility Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on an AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem for distribution feeders equipped with controllable distributed energy resources (DERs). We consider a solution method that is based on a continuous approximation of the projected gradient flow - referred to as the safe gradient flow - that incorporates voltage and current information obtained either through real-time measurements or power flow computations. These two setups enable both online and offline implementations. The safe gradient flow involves the solution of convex quadratic programs (QPs). To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a novel framework that employs a neural network approximation of the optimal solution map of the QP. The resulting method has two key features: (a) it ensures that the DERs' setpoints are practically feasible, even for an online implementation or when an offline algorithm has an early termination; (b) it ensures convergence to a neighborhood of a strict local optimizer of the AC OPF. The proposed method is tested on a 93-node distribution system with realistic loads and renewable generation. The test shows that our method successfully regulates voltages within limits during periods with high renewable generation.</description>

      <title>Moving Obstacle Collision Avoidance via Chance-Constrained MPC with CBF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) with control barrier functions (CBF) is a promising solution to address the moving obstacle collision avoidance (MOCA) problem. Unlike MPC with distance constraints (MPC-DC), this approach facilitates early obstacle avoidance without the need to increase prediction horizons. However, the existing MPC-CBF method is deterministic and fails to account for perception uncertainties. This paper proposes a generalized MPC-CBF approach for stochastic scenarios, which maintains the advantages of the deterministic method for addressing the MOCA problem. Specifically, the chance-constrained MPC-CBF (CC-MPC-CBF) technique is introduced to ensure that a user-defined collision avoidance probability is met by utilizing probabilistic CBFs. However, due to the potential empty intersection between the reachable set and the safe region confined by CBF constraints, the CC-MPC-CBF problem can pose challenges in achieving feasibility. To address this issue, we propose a sequential implementation approach that involves solving a standard MPC optimization problem followed by a predictive safety filter optimization, which leads to improved feasibility. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative convex optimization scheme to further expedite the resolution of the predictive safety filter, which results in an efficient approach to tackling the non-convex CC-MPC-CBF problem. We apply our proposed algorithm to a double integrator system for MOCA, and we showcase its resilience to obstacle measurement uncertainties and favorable feasibility properties.</description>

Abstract: Although classical model predictive control with finite control sets (FCS-MPC) is quite a popular control method, particularly in the realm of power electronics systems, its direct data-driven predictive control (FCS-DPC) counterpart has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel reformulation of a commonly used DPC scheme that allows for the application of a modified sphere decoding algorithm, known for its efficiency and prominence in FCS-MPC applications. We test the reformulation on a popular electrical drive example and compare the computation times of sphere decoding FCS-DPC with an enumeration-based and a MIQP method.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parameters of the LinDistFlow Power Flow Approximation for Distribution Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as \mbox{LinDistFlow} (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy. % in optimization applications. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Robust Data-Driven Predictive Control for Mixed Platoons under Noise and Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling mixed platoons, which consist of both connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), poses significant challenges due to the uncertain and unknown human driving behaviors. Data-driven control methods offer promising solutions by leveraging available trajectory data, but their performance can be compromised by noise and attacks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control (RDeeP-LCC) framework based on data-driven reachability analysis. The framework over-approximates system dynamics under noise and attack using a matrix zonotope set derived from data, and develops a stabilizing feedback control law. By decoupling the mixed platoon system into nominal and error components, we employ data-driven reachability sets to recursively compute error reachable sets that account for noise and attacks, and obtain tightened safety constraints of the nominal system. This leads to a robust data-driven predictive control framework, solved in a tube-based control manner. Numerical simulations and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the RDeeP-LCC method significantly improves robustness against noise and attacks, while enhancing tracking accuracy, control efficiency, energy economy, and driving comfort.</description>

      <title>Robust Output Tracking for an Uncertain and Nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE System: Preventing Induced Seismicity in Underground Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust control strategy for output tracking of a nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE system, where the ODE has logistic-like dynamics. The output feedback control was developed by bounding the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional system and the nonlinear ODE. These bounds were then leveraged to ensure the boundedness of the control coefficient and the perturbations in the error dynamics. The mathematical framework proves the controller's ability to manage two output types within the system, overcoming model uncertainties and heterogeneities, using minimal system information, and a continuous control signal. A case study addressing induced seismicity mitigation while ensuring energy production in the Groningen gas reservoir highlights the control's effectiveness. The strategy guarantees precise tracking of target seismicity rates and pressures across reservoir regions, even under parameter uncertainties. Numerical simulations validate the approach in two scenarios: gas extraction while not exceeding the intrinsic seismicity of the region and the addition of CO2 injections, achieving net-zero environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Outlier-Robust Linear System Identification Under Heavy-tailed Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the state transition matrix of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, given access to multiple independent trajectories sampled from the system. Several recent papers have conducted a non-asymptotic analysis of this problem, relying crucially on the assumption that the process noise is either Gaussian or sub-Gaussian, i.e., "light-tailed". In sharp contrast, we work under a significantly weaker noise model, assuming nothing more than the existence of the fourth moment of the noise distribution. For this setting, we provide the first set of results demonstrating that one can obtain sample-complexity bounds for linear system identification that are nearly of the same order as under sub-Gaussian noise. To achieve such results, we develop a novel robust system identification algorithm that relies on constructing multiple weakly-concentrated estimators, and then boosting their performance using suitable tools from high-dimensional robust statistics. Interestingly, our analysis reveals how the kurtosis of the noise distribution, a measure of heavy-tailedness, affects the number of trajectories needed to achieve desired estimation error bounds. Finally, we show that our algorithm and analysis technique can be easily extended to account for scenarios where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a small fraction of the collected trajectory data. Our work takes the first steps towards building a robust statistical learning theory for control under non-ideal assumptions on the data-generating process.</description>

      <title>Deficient Excitation in Parameter Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter learning problems under deficient excitation (DE). The DE condition is a rank-deficient, and therefore, a more general evolution of the well-known persistent excitation condition. Under the DE condition, a proposed online algorithm is able to calculate the identifiable and non-identifiable subspaces, and finally give an optimal parameter estimate in the sense of least squares. In particular, the learning error within the identifiable subspace exponentially converges to zero in the noise-free case, even without persistent excitation. The DE condition also provides a new perspective for solving distributed parameter learning problems, where the challenge is posed by local regressors that are often insufficiently excited. To improve knowledge of the unknown parameters, a cooperative learning protocol is proposed for a group of estimators that collect measured information under complementary DE conditions. This protocol allows each local estimator to operate locally in its identifiable subspace, and reach a consensus with neighbours in its non-identifiable subspace. As a result, the task of estimating unknown parameters can be achieved in a distributed way using cooperative local estimators. Application examples in system identification are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Optimal Output Feedback Learning Control for Discrete-Time Linear Quadratic Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based MPC for Fuel Efficient Control of Autonomous Vehicles with Discrete Gear Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Co-optimization of both vehicle speed and gear position via model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to offer benefits for fuel-efficient autonomous driving. However, optimizing both the vehicle's continuous dynamics and discrete gear positions may be too computationally intensive for a real-time implementation. This work proposes a learning-based MPC scheme to address this issue. A policy is trained to select and fix the gear positions across the prediction horizon of the MPC controller, leaving a significantly simpler continuous optimization problem to be solved online. In simulation, the proposed approach is shown to have a significantly lower computation burden and a comparable performance, with respect to pure MPC-based co-optimization.</description>

      <title>Structure Identification of NDS with Descriptor Subsystems under Asynchronous, Non-Uniform, and Slow-Rate Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networked dynamic systems (NDS) exhibit collective behavior shaped by subsystem dynamics and complex interconnections, yet identifying these interconnections remains challenging due to irregularities in sampled data, including asynchronous, non-uniform, and low-rate sampling. This paper proposes a novel two-stage structure identification algorithm that leverages system zero-order moments, a concept traditionally used in model order reduction, to bridge system identification and model reduction. First, zero-order moments are estimated from steady-state time-domain outputs; second, subsystem interconnections are explicitly reconstructed from these moments. The method generalizes existing approaches by handling asynchronous, non-uniform, and slow sampling simultaneously, eliminating constraints on input signal periodicity and extending applicability to multi-input multi-output NDS with arbitrary interconnections. Unlike black-box identification techniques, our approach explicitly recovers subsystem interconnection structures. Validation on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in recovering subsystem interconnections from irregular sampling data.</description>

      <title>Novelty Detection in Reinforcement Learning with World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08731v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using world models has found significant recent successes. However, when a sudden change to world mechanics or properties occurs then agent performance and reliability can dramatically decline. We refer to the sudden change in visual properties or state transitions as novelties. Implementing novelty detection within generated world model frameworks is a crucial task for protecting the agent when deployed. In this paper, we propose straightforward bounding approaches to incorporate novelty detection into world model RL agents, by utilizing the misalignment of the world model's hallucinated states and the true observed states as an anomaly score. We provide effective approaches to detecting novelties in a distribution of transitions learned by an agent in a world model. Finally, we show the advantage of our work in a novel environment compared to traditional machine learning novelty detection methods as well as currently accepted RL focused novelty detection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Chaos Expanded Gaussian Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In complex and unknown processes, global models are initially generated over the entire experimental space but often fail to provide accurate predictions in local areas. A common approach is to use local models, which requires partitioning the experimental space and training multiple models, adding significant complexity. Recognizing this limitation, this study addresses the need for models that effectively represent both global and local experimental spaces. It introduces a novel machine learning (ML) approach: Polynomial Chaos Expanded Gaussian Process (PCEGP), leveraging polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to calculate input-dependent hyperparameters of the Gaussian process (GP). This provides a mathematically interpretable approach that incorporates non-stationary covariance functions and heteroscedastic noise estimation to generate locally adapted models. The model performance is compared to different algorithms in benchmark tests for regression tasks. The results demonstrate low prediction errors of the PCEGP, highlighting model performance that is often competitive with or better than previous methods. A key advantage of the presented model is its interpretable hyperparameters along with training and prediction runtimes comparable to those of a GP.</description>

      <title>Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Submodular Optimization in Robot Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a communication- and computation-efficient method for distributed submodular optimization in robot mesh networks. Submodularity is a property of diminishing returns that arises in active information gathering such as mapping, surveillance, and target tracking. Our method, Resource-Aware distributed Greedy (RAG), introduces a new distributed optimization paradigm that enables scalable and near-optimal action coordination. To this end, RAG requires each robot to make decisions based only on information received from and about their neighbors. In contrast, the current paradigms allow the relay of information about all robots across the network. As a result, RAG's decision-time scales linearly with the network size, while state-of-the-art near-optimal submodular optimization algorithms scale cubically. We also characterize how the designed mesh-network topology affects RAG's approximation performance. Our analysis implies that sparser networks favor scalability without proportionally compromising approximation performance: while RAG's decision time scales linearly with network size, the gain in approximation performance scales sublinearly. We demonstrate RAG's performance in simulated scenarios of area detection with up to 45 robots, simulating realistic robot-to-robot (r2r) communication speeds such as the 0.25 Mbps speed of the Digi XBee 3 Zigbee 3.0. In the simulations, RAG enables real-time planning, up to three orders of magnitude faster than competitive near-optimal algorithms, while also achieving superior mean coverage performance. To enable the simulations, we extend the high-fidelity and photo-realistic simulator AirSim by integrating a scalable collaborative autonomy pipeline to tens of robots and simulating r2r communication delays. Our code is available at https://github.com/UM-iRaL/Resource-Aware-Coordination-AirSim.</description>

      <title>Adapting Gait Frequency for Posture-regulating Humanoid Push-recovery via Hierarchical Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current humanoid push-recovery strategies often use whole-body motion, yet they tend to overlook posture regulation. For instance, in manipulation tasks, the upper body may need to stay upright and have minimal recovery displacement. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhancing humanoid push-recovery performance under unknown disturbances and regulating body posture by tailoring the recovery stepping strategy. We propose a hierarchical-MPC-based scheme that analyzes and detects instability in the prediction window and quickly recovers through adapting gait frequency. Our approach integrates a high-level nonlinear MPC, a posture-aware gait frequency adaptation planner, and a low-level convex locomotion MPC. The planners predict the center of mass (CoM) state trajectories that can be assessed for precursors of potential instability and posture deviation. In simulation, we demonstrate improved maximum recoverable impulse by 131% on average compared with baseline approaches. In hardware experiments, a 125 ms advancement in recovery stepping timing/reflex has been observed with the proposed approach. We also demonstrate improved push-recovery performance and minimized body attitude change under 0.2 rad.</description>

      <title>Criticality and Safety Margins for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State of the art reinforcement learning methods sometimes encounter unsafe situations. Identifying when these situations occur is of interest both for post-hoc analysis and during deployment, where it might be advantageous to call out to a human overseer for help. Efforts to gauge the criticality of different points in time have been developed, but their accuracy is not well established due to a lack of ground truth, and they are not designed to be easily interpretable by end users. Therefore, we seek to define a criticality framework with both a quantifiable ground truth and a clear significance to users. We introduce true criticality as the expected drop in reward when an agent deviates from its policy for n consecutive random actions. We also introduce the concept of proxy criticality, a low-overhead metric that has a statistically monotonic relationship to true criticality. Safety margins make these interpretable, when defined as the number of random actions for which performance loss will not exceed some tolerance with high confidence. We demonstrate this approach in several environment-agent combinations; for an A3C agent in an Atari Beamrider environment, the lowest 5% of safety margins contain 47% of agent losses; i.e., supervising only 5% of decisions could potentially prevent roughly half of an agent's errors. This criticality framework measures the potential impacts of bad decisions, even before those decisions are made, allowing for more effective debugging and oversight of autonomous agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of interactive text-to-image (T2I) generation, designing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent which iteratively improves a set of generated images for a user through a sequence of prompt expansions. Using human raters, we create a novel dataset of sequential preferences, which we leverage, together with large-scale open-source (non-sequential) datasets. We construct user-preference and user-choice models using an EM strategy and identify varying user preference types. We then leverage a large multimodal language model (LMM) and a value-based RL approach to suggest an adaptive and diverse slate of prompt expansions to the user. Our Preference Adaptive and Sequential Text-to-image Agent (PASTA) extends T2I models with adaptive multi-turn capabilities, fostering collaborative co-creation and addressing uncertainty or underspecification in a user's intent. We evaluate PASTA using human raters, showing significant improvement compared to baseline methods. We also open-source our sequential rater dataset and simulated user-rater interactions to support future research in user-centric multi-turn T2I systems.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Sampling-Based MPC for Collision Avoidance in Uncertain Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating safely in dynamic and uncertain environments is challenging due to uncertainties in perception and motion. This letter presents the Chance-Constrained Unscented Model Predictive Path Integral (C2U-MPPI) framework, a robust sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that addresses these challenges by leveraging the U-MPPI control strategy with integrated probabilistic chance constraints, enabling more reliable and efficient navigation under uncertainty. Unlike gradient-based MPC methods, our approach (i) avoids linearization of system dynamics by directly applying non-convex and nonlinear chance constraints, enabling more accurate and flexible optimization, and (ii) enhances computational efficiency by leveraging a deterministic form of probabilistic constraints and employing a layered dynamic obstacle representation, enabling real-time handling of multiple obstacles. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world human-shared environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm against baseline methods, showcasing its capability to generate feasible trajectories and control inputs that adhere to system dynamics and constraints in dynamic settings, enabled by unscented-based sampling strategy and risk-sensitive trajectory evaluation.

      <title>Gait-Net-augmented Implicit Kino-dynamic MPC for Dynamic Variable-frequency Humanoid Locomotion over Discrete Terrains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order-model-based optimal control techniques for humanoid locomotion struggle to adapt step duration and placement simultaneously in dynamic walking gaits due to their reliance on fixed-time discretization, which limits responsiveness to various disturbances and results in suboptimal performance in challenging conditions. In this work, we propose a Gait-Net-augmented implicit kino-dynamic model-predictive control (MPC) to simultaneously optimize step location, step duration, and contact forces for natural variable-frequency locomotion. The proposed method incorporates a Gait-Net-augmented Sequential Convex MPC algorithm to solve multi-linearly constrained variables by iterative quadratic programs. At its core, a lightweight Gait-frequency Network (Gait-Net) determines the preferred step duration in terms of variable MPC sampling times, simplifying step duration optimization to the parameter level. Additionally, it enhances and updates the spatial reference trajectory within each sequential iteration by incorporating local solutions, allowing the projection of kinematic constraints to the design of reference trajectories. We validate the proposed algorithm in high-fidelity simulations and on small-size humanoid hardware, demonstrating its capability for variable-frequency and 3-D discrete terrain locomotion with only a one-step preview of terrain data.</description>

      <title>UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Safe and Optimal Control of Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As autonomous systems become more ubiquitous in daily life, ensuring high performance with guaranteed safety is crucial. However, safety and performance could be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult. Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.</description>

Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

      <title>Digital-physical testbed for ship autonomy studies in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06787</link>

Abstract: The algorithms developed for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are often challenging to test on actual vessels due to high operational costs and safety considerations. Simulations offer a cost-effective alternative and eliminate risks, but they may not accurately represent real-world dynamics for the given tasks. Utilizing small-scale model ships and robotic vessels in conjunction with a laboratory basin provides an accessible testing environment for the early stages of validation processes. However, designing and developing a model vessel for a single test can be costly and cumbersome, and researchers often lack access to such infrastructure. To address these challenges and enable streamlined testing, we have developed an in-house testbed that facilitates the development, testing, verification, and validation of MASS algorithms in a digital-physical laboratory. This infrastructure includes a set of small-scale model vessels, a simulation environment for each vessel, a comprehensive testbed environment, and a digital twin in Unity. With this, we aim to establish a full design and verification pipeline that starts with high-fidelity simulation models of each model vessel, to the model-scale testing in the laboratory basin, allowing possibilities for moving towards semi-fullscale validation with R/V milliAmpere1 and full-scale validation with R/V Gunnerus. In this work, we present our progress on the development of this testbed environment and its components, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling ship guidance, navigation, and control (GNC), including autonomy.</description>
