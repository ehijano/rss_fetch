      <title>Nonequilibrium entropy from density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy is a central concept in physics, but can be challenging to calculate even for systems that are easily simulated. This is exacerbated out of equilibrium, where generally little is known about the distribution characterizing simulated configurations. However, modern machine learning algorithms can estimate the probability density characterizing an ensemble of images, given nothing more than sample images assumed to be drawn from this distribution. We show that by mapping system configurations to images, such approaches can be adapted to the efficient estimation of the density, and therefore the entropy, from simulated or experimental data. We then use this idea to obtain entropic limit cycles in a kinetic Ising model driven by an oscillating magnetic field. Despite being a global probe, we demonstrate that this allows us to identify and characterize stochastic dynamics at parameters near the dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Modified version of open TASEP with dynamic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the study of site-wise dynamically disordered totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). Motivated by the process of gene transcription, a study in ref. [39] introduced an extension of TASEP, where the defects (or obstacles) bind/un-bind dynamically to the sites of the lattice and the hopping of the particles on lattice faces a hindrance if the arrival site is occupied by an obstacle. In addition, the particle is only allowed to enter the lattice provided the first site is defect-free. In our study, we propose that the particle movement at the entry of the lattice must face an equal hindrance that is provided by the obstacles to the rest of the particles on the lattice. For open boundaries, the continuum mean-field equations are derived and solved numerically to obtain steady-state phase diagrams and density profiles. The presence of obstacles produces a shift in the phase boundaries obtained but the same three phases as obtained for the standard TASEP. Contrary to the model introduced in ref. \cite{waclaw2019totally}, the idea to introduce the modification at the entrance shows that the limiting case $p_d \rightarrow 1$ converges to the standard TASEP, where $p_d$ refers to the affected hopping rate due to presence of obstacle. The mean-field solutions are validated using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic spatial Lotka-Volterra predator-prey models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic, spatially extended models for predator-prey interaction display spatio-temporal structures that are not captured by the Lotka-Volterra mean-field rate equations. These spreading activity fronts reflect persistent correlations between predators and prey that can be analyzed through field-theoretic methods. Introducing local restrictions on the prey population induces a predator extinction threshold, with the critical dynamics at this continuous active-to-absorbing state transition governed by the scaling exponents of directed percolation. Novel features in biologically motivated model variants include the stabilizing effect of a periodically varying carrying capacity that describes seasonally oscillating resource availability; enhanced mean species densities and local fluctuations caused by spatially varying reaction rates; and intriguing evolutionary dynamics emerging when variable interaction rates are affixed to individuals combined with trait inheritance to their offspring. The basic susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-recovered models for infectious disease spreading near their epidemic thresholds are respectively captured by the directed and dynamic isotropic percolation universality classes. Systems with three cyclically competing species akin to spatial rock-paper-scissors games may display striking spiral patterns, yet conservation laws can prevent such noise-induced structure formation. In diffusively coupled inhomogeneous settings, one may observe the stabilization of vulnerable ecologies prone to finite-size extinction or fixation due to immigration waves emanating from the interfaces.</description>

      <title>An Imprecise Maxwell's Demon with Feedback Delay: An Exactly Solvable Information Engine Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite cycle time information engine based on a two-level system in contact with a thermal reservoir is studied analytically. The model for the engine incorporates an error in measuring the system's state and time delay between the measurement and the feedback process. The efficiency and power of the engine in steady state are derived as a function of level spacing, feedback delay time, engine cycle time, and measurement error. For a fixed value of level spacing and feedback delay, there is an upper bound on measurement error such that the engine can extract positive work. This threshold value of error is found to be independent of the cycle time. For a range of values of level spacing and feedback delay time, efficiency has a non-monotonic dependence on the measurement error, implying that there is an optimal measurement error for the information engine to operate efficiently. At high temperatures and with precise measurement, the engine's ability to extract positive work is extended over a larger range of feedback delay time.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for a class of Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent works have considered Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain special classes of initial states (e.g., states with particle-free regions or perturbations of stationary states), the velocity of information propagation was bounded by a constant in time, $v\leq C$, similarly to quantum spin systems. However, for the more general class of bounded-density initial states, the first-named author together with Vu and Saito derived the velocity bound $v\leq C t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial lattice dimension. For $D\geq 2$, this bound allows for accelerated information propagation. It has been known since the work of Eisert and Gross that some systems of lattice bosons are capable of accelerated information propagation. It is therefore a central question to understand under what conditions the bound $v\leq C t^{D-1}$ can be enhanced. Here, we prove that additional physical constraints, translation-invariance and a $p$-body repulsion of the form $n_x^p$ with $p&gt;D+1$, lead to a LRB with $v\leq C t^{\frac{D}{p-D-1}}$ for any initial state of bounded energy density. We also identify examples of quantum states which show that no further enhancement is possible without using additional dynamical constraints.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Solvent Viscosity Tune the Intermediates During the Collapse of a Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of a polymer chain in solution gets significantly affected by the temperature and the frictional forces arising due to solvent viscosity. Here, using an explicit solvent framework for polymer simulation with the liberty to tune the solvent viscosity, we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a flexible homopolymer when it is suddenly quenched from an extended coil state in good solvent to poor solvent conditions. Results from our extensive simulations reveal that depending on the temperature $T$ and solvent viscosity, one encounters long-lived sausage-like intermediates following the usual pearl-necklace intermediates. Use of shape factors of polymers allows us to disentangle these two distinct stages of the overall collapse process, and the corresponding relaxation times. The relaxation time $\tau_s$ of the sausage stage, which is the rate-limiting stage of the overall collapse process, follows an anti-Arrhenius behavior in the high-$T$ limit, and the Arrhenius behavior in the low-$T$ limit. Furthermore, the variation of $\tau_s$ with the solvent viscosity provides evidence of internal friction of the polymer, that modulates the overall collapse significantly, analogous to what is observed for relaxation rates of proteins during their folding. This suggests that the origin of internal friction in proteins is plausibly intrinsic to its polymeric backbone rather than other specifications.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Information Capacity in Random Circuits and Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-Andr\'e models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. Those numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, plays a central role in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). The generators of such symmetries have a close connection to non-abelian anyonic objects in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we revisit the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra "bulk semionization" which corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs. This is a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and can be interpreted as a version of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography has been expected to be applicable to the systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for a linear system with annealed disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a disordered multi-dimensional linear system in which the interaction parameters vary stochastically in time with defined temporal correlations. We refer to this type of disorder as "annealed", in contrast to quenched disorder in which couplings are fixed in time. We extend Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to accommodate annealed disorder and employ it to find the exact solution of the linear model in the limit of a large number of degrees of freedom. Our analysis yields analytical results for the non-stationary auto-correlation, the stationary variance, the power spectral density, and the phase diagram of the model. Interestingly, some unexpected features emerge upon changing the correlation time of the interactions. The stationary variance of the system and the critical variance of the disorder are generally found to be a non-monotonic function of the correlation time of the interactions. We also find that in some cases a re-entrant phase transition takes place when this correlation time is varied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00662v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstate thermalization in terms of a Hermitian operator and the complex eigenkets that follows Gaussian ensemble distribution. With the non-Hermitian open bipartite system, there are, however, some global restrictions such that the elements share some of the properties of Gaussian orthogonal ensemble in diagonal and off-diagonal perspective. Such global restrictions enforce that one of the subsystem contains a nullspace with non-defective degeneracies (the primary subsystem), and the another full-ranked subsystem (the secondary subsystem). For the primary subsystem, the mixed densities in Hermitian and non-Hermitian basis exhibits global fluctuation and unidirectional (non-Hermitian skin effect) fluctuation, respectively. The former is due to the global restrictions of the whole system which plays teh role of environmental disorder, while the latter is due to the nonlocal symmetries which is allowed in the restricted Hilbert space.
  We also investigate the integrablity-chaos transition with independent perturbations in terms of the Berry autocorrelation in semicalssical limit, where there is a phase space spanned by the momentum-like projection and the range of local wave function.</description>

      <title>Particle density and critical point for studying site percolation by finite size scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has recently achieved remarkable success in studying phase transitions. It is generally believed that the latent variables of unsupervised learning can capture the information related to phase transitions, which is usually achieved through the so-called order parameter. In most models, for instance the Ising, the order parameters are simply the particle number densities. The percolation, the simplest model which can generate a phase transition, however, has a unique order parameter which is not particle number density. In this paper, we use unsupervised learning to study the relationship between particle number density, critical point, and latent variables in the site percolation model. It is found that if the input of learning is the original configuration, then the output of unsupervised learning does not convey any information related to the phase transition. Therefore, the maximum cluster is employed in order to effectively capture the critical point of the model. Unsupervised learning yields reliable results consistent with Monte Carlo simulations. We also propose a method called Fake Finite Size Scaling (FFSS) to calculate the critical value, which improves the accuracy of fitting to a great extent.</description>

Abstract: Unraveling the universal principles governing the response of complex systems to environmental changes is crucial for predicting and controlling their behavior. While fluctuation-dissipation relations have been established for systems near equilibrium, a general framework for understanding the responsiveness of systems far from steady states remains elusive. Here, we introduce a novel approach based on the information geometry of stochastic trajectories to derive a set of universal thermodynamic bounds on the response of any Markov system, regardless of its proximity to steady states. This theory establishes a new paradigm in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, providing a unified perspective on the behavior of non-stationary systems, from biological processes to engineered devices, and paving the way for designing complex responsiveness in far-from-equilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: In a paper on ``the Brownian motion analog of the well-known Milne problem in radiative transfer theory'' [\textit{J Stat Phys} 25 (1981) 569--82], Burschka and Titulaer reported: ``The value we find for this `Milne extrapolation length' is, in the appropriate dimensionless units, approximately twice the value found in the radiative transfer problem.'' In a study [\textit{J Stat Phys} 65 (1991) 1217--33] describing the absorption, by a black sphere of radius $R$, of particles executing a Rayleigh flight (randomly directed displacements of equal length $l$), the extrapolation length $\gamma$ was found to be about half as small as the benchmark result (for $R\gg l)$. The first discrepancy is shown to result from the disparity of the two length scales; the second, from the zero variance of the jump lengths. Ziff's finding that $\gamma$ is independent of $R$ for $0&lt;l\leq 2R)$, cannot be reconciled with studies based on the Lorentz-Boltzmann equation and the Klein-Kramers equation.</description>

Abstract: Based on the variational field theory framework, we extend our previous mean-field formalism, taking into account the electrostatic correlations of the ions. We employ a general covariant approach and derive a total stress tensor that considers the electrostatic correlations of ions. This is accomplished through an additional term that depends on the autocorrelation function of local electric field fluctuations. Utilizing the derived total stress tensor and applying the mechanical equilibrium condition, we establish a general expression for the disjoining pressure of the Coulomb fluids, confined in a pore with a slit-like geometry. Using this equation, we derive an asymptotic expression for the disjoining pressure in a slit-like pore with non-electrified conductive walls. Present theory is the basis for future modeling of the mechanical stresses that occur in electrode pores with conductive charged walls, immersed in liquid phase electrolytes beyond the mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Truncation Crafted for UV-divergent QFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) to systematically study RG flows that require the renormalization of coupling constants. This is a necessary step towards making HT a fully general method for QFT calculations. We apply this theory to a number of QFTs defined as relevant deformations of $d=1+1$ CFTs. We investigated three examples of increasing complexity: the deformed Ising, Tricritical-Ising, and non-unitary minimal model $M(3,7)$. The first two examples provide a crosscheck of our methodologies against well established characteristics of these theories. The $M(3,7)$ CFT deformed by its $Z_2$-even operators shows an intricate phase diagram that we clarify. At a boundary of this phase diagram we show that this theory flows, in the IR, to the $M(3,5)$ CFT.</description>

Abstract: Unlike unitary dynamics, measurements of a subsystem can induce long-range entanglement via quantum teleportation. The amount of measurement-induced entanglement or mutual information depends jointly on the measurement basis and the entanglement structure of the state (before measurement), and has operational significance for whether the state is a resource for measurement-based quantum computing, as well as for the computational complexity of simulating the state using quantum or classical computers. In this work, we examine entropic measures of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) and information (MII) for the ground-states of quantum many-body systems in one- and two- spatial dimensions. From numerical and analytic analysis of a variety of models encompassing critical points, quantum Hall states, string-net topological orders, and Fermi liquids, we identify universal features of the long-distance structure of MIE and MII that depend only on the underlying phase or critical universality class of the state. We argue that, whereas in $1d$ the leading contributions to long-range MIE and MII are universal, in $2d$, the existence of a teleportation transition for finite-depth circuits implies that trivial $2d$ states can exhibit long-range MIE, and the universal features lie in sub-leading corrections. We introduce modified MIE measures that directly extract these universal contributions. As a corollary, we show that the leading contributions to strange-correlators, used to numerically identify topological phases, are in fact non-universal in two or more dimensions, and explain how our modified constructions enable one to isolate universal components. We discuss the implications of these results for classical- and quantum- computational simulation of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the five-vertex model with scalar-product boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous five-vertex model on a rectangle domain of the square lattice with so-called scalar-product boundary conditions. Peculiarity of these boundary conditions is that the configurations of the model are in an one-to-one correspondence with the 3D Young diagrams limited by a box of a given size. We address the thermodynamics of the model using a connection of the partition function with the $\tau$-function of the sixth Painlev\'e equation. We compute an expansion of the logarithm of the partition function to the order of a constant in the size of the system. We find that the geometry of the domain is crucial for phase transition phenomena. Two cases need to be considered separately: one is where the region has an asymptotically square shape and the second one is where it is of an arbitrary rectangle, but not square, shape. In the first case there are three regimes, which can be attributed to dominance in the configurations of a ferroelectric order, disorder, and anti-ferroelectric order. In the second case the third regime is absent.</description>

      <title>Solving the Yang-Baxter, tetrahedron and higher simplex equations using Clifford algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bethe Ansatz was discoverd in 1932. Half a century later its algebraic structure was unearthed: Yang-Baxter equation was discovered, as well as its multidimensional generalizations [tetrahedron equation and $d$-simplex equations]. Here we describe a universal method to solve these equations using Clifford algebras. The Yang-Baxter equation ($d=2$), Zamalodchikov's tetrahedron equation ($d=3$) and the Bazhanov-Stroganov equation ($d=4$) are special cases. Our solutions form a linear space. This helps us to include spectral parameters. Potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.</description>
