      <title>Algorithms and topological invariants for dynamic systems. III. Algorithms for Recognition and Classification of 2-Dimensional Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct algorithms and topological invariants that allow us to distinguish the topological type of a surface, as well as functions and vector fields for their topological equivalence. In the first part (arXiv:2501.15657), we discused basic concepts of diferential topology. In the second part (arXiv:2502.00506 ) we discused the main discrete topological structures used in the topological theory of dynamic systems. In third part we construct algorithms that allow us recognise 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds in simplicial complexes and regular CW-complex and detreminate topological type for 2-manifolds (connectivity, type of orientability, genus, number of boundary component).</description>

      <title>Diameter bounds for $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-orbits of origamis in $\mathcal{H}(2)$ and the Prym loci in $\mathcal{H}(4)$ and $\mathcal{H}(6)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using algorithms implicit in the classification of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-orbits of primitive origamis in the stratum $\mathcal{H}(2)$ due to Hubert-Leli\`evre and McMullen, we give diameter bounds on the resulting orbit graphs. Since the machinery of McMullen from $\mathcal{H}(2)$ is generalised and reused in Lanneau and Nguyen's classification of the orbits of Prym eigenforms in $\mathcal{H}(4)$ and $\mathcal{H}(6),$ we are also able to obtain diameter bounds for the orbit graphs in this setting as well. In each stratum, we obtain diameter bounds of the form $O(N^{2/3}\log N)$, where $N$ is the size of the orbit graph.</description>

      <title>Characterization of quasispheres via smooth approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every two-dimensional quasisphere is the limit of a sequence of smooth spheres that are uniform quasispheres. In the case of metric spheres of finite area we provide necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for a quasisphere, involving the doubling property, linear local connectivity, the Loewner property, conformal modulus, and reciprocity. In particular, although an arbitrary quasisphere does not satisfy necessarily all of those geometric conditions, we prove that every quasisphere can be approximated by uniform quasispheres that are uniformly doubling, linearly locally connected, 2-Loewner, reciprocal and satisfy a uniform bound for the modulus of annuli.</description>

      <title>Behaviour of the Schwarzian derivative on long complex projective tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzian derivative parametrizes the fibres of the space of complex projective structures on a surface as vector bundle over its Teichm\"uller space. We study its behaviour on long complex projective tubes, and get estimates for the pairing of its real part with infinitesimal earthquakes and graftings. As the real part of their Schwarzian coincides with the differential of the renormalized volume we obtain bounds for the variation of renormalized volume under complex earthquake paths, and its asymptotic behaviour under pinching a compressible curve.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometry classification of certain graph $2$-braid groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Oh22}, the second author defined a complex of groups decomposition of the fundamental group of a finitely generated 2-dimensional special group, called an \emph{intersection complex}, which is a quasi-isometry invariant. In this paper, using the theory of intersection complexes, we classify the class of 2-braid groups over graphs with circumference $\leq 1$ up to quasi-isometry. Moreover, we find a sufficient condition when such a graph 2-braid group is quasi-isometric to a right-angled Artin group or not. Finally, by applying the same method, we also find that there is an algorithm to determine whether two 4-braid groups over trees are quasi-isometric or not.</description>

      <title>Kauffman bracket skein modules of small 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proof of Witten's finiteness conjecture established that the Kauffman bracket skein modules of closed $3$-manifolds are finitely generated over $\mathbb Q(A)$. In this paper, we develop a novel method for computing these skein modules.
  We show that if the skein module $S(M,\mathbb Q[A^{\pm 1}])$ of $M$ is tame (e.g. finitely generated over $\mathbb Q[A^{\pm 1}]$), and the $SL(2,\mathbb
  C)$-character variety is reduced, then the dimension $\dim_{\mathbb Q(A)}\, S(M, \mathbb Q(A))$ is the number of closed points in this character variety. This, in particular, verifies a conjecture in the literature that relates the dimension $\dim_{\mathbb Q(A)}\, S(M, \mathbb Q(A))$ to the Abouzaid-Manolescu $SL(2,\mathbb C)$-Floer theoretic invariants, for large families of 3-manifolds.
  We also prove a criterion for reduceness of character varieties of closed $3$-manifolds and use it to compute the skein modules of Dehn fillings of $(2,2n+1)$-torus knots and of the figure-eight knot. The later family gives the first instance of computations of skein modules for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.
  We also prove that the skein modules of rational homology spheres have dimension at least $1$ over $\mathbb Q(A)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct for each conformal structure on a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2 a proper slice in the character variety of representations of the associated surface group into SL(3,R) that belongs to the Barbot component and show that the corresponding representations are Borel Anosov. We describe a fibered geometric structure in the space of full flags associated with these representations.</description>

      <title>Cohomological characterisation of hyperbolicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any geodesic metric space $X$, we give a complete cohomological characterisation of the hyperbolicity of $X$ in terms of vanishing of its second $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology. We extend this result to the relative setting of $X$ with a collection of uniformly hyperbolic subgraphs. As an application, we give a cohomological characterisation of acylindrical hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>
