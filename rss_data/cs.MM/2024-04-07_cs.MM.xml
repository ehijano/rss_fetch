      <title>InstructHumans: Editing Animated 3D Human Textures with Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present InstructHumans, a novel framework for instruction-driven 3D human texture editing. Existing text-based editing methods use Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill guidance from generative models. This work shows that naively using such scores is harmful to editing as they destroy consistency with the source avatar. Instead, we propose an alternate SDS for Editing (SDS-E) that selectively incorporates subterms of SDS across diffusion timesteps. We further enhance SDS-E with spatial smoothness regularization and gradient-based viewpoint sampling to achieve high-quality edits with sharp and high-fidelity detailing. InstructHumans significantly outperforms existing 3D editing methods, consistent with the initial avatar while faithful to the textual instructions.

      <title>Embedded Heterogeneous Attention Transformer for Cross-lingual Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual image captioning is a challenging task that requires addressing both cross-lingual and cross-modal obstacles in multimedia analysis. The crucial issue in this task is to model the global and the local matching between the image and different languages. Existing cross-modal embedding methods based on the transformer architecture oversee the local matching between the image region and monolingual words, especially when dealing with diverse languages. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Embedded Heterogeneous Attention Transformer (EHAT) to establish cross-domain relationships and local correspondences between images and different languages by using a heterogeneous network. EHAT comprises Masked Heterogeneous Cross-attention (MHCA), Heterogeneous Attention Reasoning Network (HARN), and Heterogeneous Co-attention (HCA). The HARN serves as the core network and it captures cross-domain relationships by leveraging visual bounding box representation features to connect word features from two languages and to learn heterogeneous maps. MHCA and HCA facilitate cross-domain integration in the encoder through specialized heterogeneous attention mechanisms, enabling a single model to generate captions in two languages. We evaluate our approach on the MSCOCO dataset to generate captions in English and Chinese, two languages that exhibit significant differences in their language families. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing advanced monolingual methods. Our proposed EHAT framework effectively addresses the challenges of cross-lingual image captioning, paving the way for improved multilingual image analysis and understanding.</description>

      <title>WaterVG: Waterway Visual Grounding based on Text-Guided Vision and mmWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perception of waterways based on human intent is significant for autonomous navigation and operations of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) in water environments. Inspired by visual grounding, we introduce WaterVG, the first visual grounding dataset designed for USV-based waterway perception based on human prompts. WaterVG encompasses prompts describing multiple targets, with annotations at the instance level including bounding boxes and masks. Notably, WaterVG includes 11,568 samples with 34,987 referred targets, whose prompts integrates both visual and radar characteristics. The pattern of text-guided two sensors equips a finer granularity of text prompts with visual and radar features of referred targets. Moreover, we propose a low-power visual grounding model, Potamoi, which is a multi-task model with a well-designed Phased Heterogeneous Modality Fusion (PHMF) mode, including Adaptive Radar Weighting (ARW) and Multi-Head Slim Cross Attention (MHSCA). Exactly, ARW extracts required radar features to fuse with vision for prompt alignment. MHSCA is an efficient fusion module with a remarkably small parameter count and FLOPs, elegantly fusing scenario context captured by two sensors with linguistic features, which performs expressively on visual grounding tasks. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations have been conducted on WaterVG, where our Potamoi archives state-of-the-art performances compared with counterparts.</description>

      <title>WorDepth: Variational Language Prior for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities, i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed, i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end, we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework, we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To "select" a specific reconstruction or depth map, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in the other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both.</description>
