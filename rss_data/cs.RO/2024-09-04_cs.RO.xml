      <title>SlipNet: Slip Cost Map for Autonomous Navigation on Heterogeneous Deformable Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous space rovers face significant challenges when navigating deformable and heterogeneous terrains during space exploration. The variability in terrain types, influenced by different soil properties, often results in severe wheel slip, compromising navigation efficiency and potentially leading to entrapment. This paper proposes SlipNet, an approach for predicting slip in segmented regions of heterogeneous deformable terrain surfaces to enhance navigation algorithms. Unlike previous methods, SlipNet does not depend on prior terrain classification, reducing prediction errors and misclassifications through dynamic terrain segmentation and slip assignment during deployment while maintaining a history of terrain classes. This adaptive reclassification mechanism has improved prediction performance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our model (DeepLab v3+ + SlipNet) achieves better slip prediction performance than the TerrainNet, with a lower mean absolute error (MAE) in five terrain sample tests.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Welding Defect Detection Using Audio And Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the application of AI to robotic welding. Robotic welding is a widely used technology in many industries, but robots currently do not have the capability to detect welding defects which get introduced due to various reasons in the welding process. We describe how deep-learning methods can be applied to detect weld defects in real-time by recording the welding process with microphones and a camera. Our findings are based on a large database with more than 4000 welding samples we collected which covers different weld types, materials and various defect categories. All deep learning models are trained in an unsupervised fashion because the space of possible defects is large and the defects in our data may contain biases. We demonstrate that a reliable real-time detection of most categories of weld defects is feasible both from audio and video, with improvements achieved by combining both modalities. Specifically, the multi-modal approach achieves an average Area-under-ROC-Curve (AUC) of 0.92 over all eleven defect types in our data. We conclude the paper with an analysis of the results by defect type and a discussion of future work.</description>

      <title>Kinesthetic Teaching in Robotics: a Mixed Reality Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As collaborative robots become more common in manufacturing scenarios and adopted in hybrid human-robot teams, we should develop new interaction and communication strategies to ensure smooth collaboration between agents. In this paper, we propose a novel communicative interface that uses Mixed Reality as a medium to perform Kinesthetic Teaching (KT) on any robotic platform. We evaluate our proposed approach in a user study involving multiple subjects and two different robots, comparing traditional physical KT with holographic-based KT through user experience questionnaires and task-related metrics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-orbit servicing (OOS) activities will power the next big step for sustainable exploration and commercialization of space. Developing robotic capabilities for autonomous OOS operations is a priority for the space industry. Visual Servoing (VS) enables robots to achieve the precise manoeuvres needed for critical OOS missions by utilizing visual information for motion control. This article presents an overview of existing VS approaches for autonomous OOS operations with space manipulator systems (SMS). We divide the approaches according to their contribution to the typical phases of a robotic OOS mission: a) Recognition, b) Approach, and c) Contact. We also present a discussion on the reviewed VS approaches, identifying current trends. Finally, we highlight the challenges and areas for future research on VS techniques for robotic OOS.</description>

      <title>YoloTag: Vision-based Robust UAV Navigation with Fiducial Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By harnessing fiducial markers as visual landmarks in the environment, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can rapidly build precise maps and navigate spaces safely and efficiently, unlocking their potential for fluent collaboration and coexistence with humans. Existing fiducial marker methods rely on handcrafted feature extraction, which sacrifices accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning pipelines for marker detection fail to meet real-time runtime constraints crucial for navigation applications. In this work, we propose YoloTag \textemdash a real-time fiducial marker-based localization system. YoloTag uses a lightweight YOLO v8 object detector to accurately detect fiducial markers in images while meeting the runtime constraints needed for navigation. The detected markers are then used by an efficient perspective-n-point algorithm to estimate UAV states. However, this localization system introduces noise, causing instability in trajectory tracking. To suppress noise, we design a higher-order Butterworth filter that effectively eliminates noise through frequency domain analysis. We evaluate our algorithm through real-robot experiments in an indoor environment, comparing the trajectory tracking performance of our method against other approaches in terms of several distance metrics.</description>

      <title>Coaching a Robotic Sonographer: Learning Robotic Ultrasound with Sparse Expert's Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound is widely employed for clinical intervention and diagnosis, due to its advantages of offering non-invasive, radiation-free, and real-time imaging. However, the accessibility of this dexterous procedure is limited due to the substantial training and expertise required of operators. The robotic ultrasound (RUS) offers a viable solution to address this limitation; nonetheless, achieving human-level proficiency remains challenging. Learning from demonstrations (LfD) methods have been explored in RUS, which learns the policy prior from a dataset of offline demonstrations to encode the mental model of the expert sonographer. However, active engagement of experts, i.e. Coaching, during the training of RUS has not been explored thus far. Coaching is known for enhancing efficiency and performance in human training. This paper proposes a coaching framework for RUS to amplify its performance. The framework combines DRL (self-supervised practice) with sparse expert's feedback through coaching. The DRL employs an off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) network, with a reward based on image quality rating. The coaching by experts is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which updates the policy parameters based on the correction by the expert. The validation study on phantoms showed that coaching increases the learning rate by $25\%$ and the number of high-quality image acquisition by $74.5\%$.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Wheeled Mobility on Vertically Challenging Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-road navigation on vertically challenging terrain, involving steep slopes and rugged boulders, presents significant challenges for wheeled robots both at the planning level to achieve smooth collision-free trajectories and at the control level to avoid rolling over or getting stuck. Considering the complex model of wheel-terrain interactions, we develop an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) system for an autonomous vehicle to learn wheeled mobility through simulated trial-and-error experiences. Using a custom-designed simulator built on the Chrono multi-physics engine, our approach leverages Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a terrain difficulty curriculum to refine a policy based on a reward function to encourage progress towards the goal and penalize excessive roll and pitch angles, which circumvents the need of complex and expensive kinodynamic modeling, planning, and control. Additionally, we present experimental results in the simulator and deploy our approach on a physical Verti-4-Wheeler (V4W) platform, demonstrating that RL can equip conventional wheeled robots with previously unrealized potential of navigating vertically challenging terrain.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Based Cooperative Transport for Concave Objects with a Swarm of Miniature Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An occlusion based strategy for collective transport of a concave object using a swarm of mobile robots has been proposed in this paper. We aim to overcome the challenges of transporting concave objects using decentralized approach. The interesting aspect of this task is that the agents have no prior knowledge about the geometry of the object and do not explicitly communicate with each other. The concept is to eliminate the concavity of the object by filling a number of robots in its cavity and then carry out an occlusion based transport strategy on the newly formed convex object or "pseudo object". We divide our work into two parts: concavity filling of various concave objects and occlusion based collective transport of convex objects.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Logic Control for Indoor Navigation of Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots have many applications in indoor unstructured environment, wherein optimal movement of the robot is needed. The robot therefore needs to navigate in unknown and dynamic environments. This paper presents an implementation of fuzzy logic controller for navigation of mobile robot in an unknown dynamically cluttered environment. Fuzzy logic controller is used here as it is capable of making inferences even under uncertainties. It helps in rule generation and decision making process in order to reach the goal position under various situations. Sensor readings from the robot and the desired direction of motion are inputs to the fuzz logic controllers and the acceleration of the respective wheels are the output of the controller. Hence, the mobile robot avoids obstacles and reaches the goal position. Keywords: Fuzzy Logic Controller, Membership Functions, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang FIS, Centroid Defuzzification</description>

      <title>USV-AUV Collaboration Framework for Underwater Tasks under Extreme Sea Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are valuable for ocean exploration due to their flexibility and ability to carry communication and detection units. Nevertheless, AUVs alone often face challenges in harsh and extreme sea conditions. This study introduces a unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-AUV collaboration framework, which includes high-precision multi-AUV positioning using USV path planning via Fisher information matrix optimization and reinforcement learning for multi-AUV cooperative tasks. Applied to a multi-AUV underwater data collection task scenario, extensive simulations validate the framework's feasibility and superior performance, highlighting exceptional coordination and robustness under extreme sea conditions. The simulation code will be made available as open-source to foster future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Dispelling Four Challenges in Inertial Motion Tracking with One Recurrent Inertial Graph-based Estimator (RING)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Recurrent Inertial Graph-based Estimator (RING), a novel neural-network-based solution for Inertial Motion Tracking (IMT), to generalize across a large range of sampling rates, and we demonstrate that it can overcome four real-world challenges: inhomogeneous magnetic fields, sensor-to-segment misalignment, sparse sensor setups, and nonrigid sensor attachment. RING can estimate the rotational state of a three-segment kinematic chain with double hinge joints from inertial data, and achieves an experimental mean-absolute-(tracking)-error of 8.10 +/- 1.19 degrees if all four challenges are present simultaneously. The network is trained on simulated data yet evaluated on experimental data, highlighting its remarkable ability to zero-shot generalize from simulation to experiment. We conduct an ablation study to analyze the impact of each of the four challenges on RING's performance, we showcase its robustness to varying sampling rates, and we demonstrate that RING is capable of real-time operation. This research not only advances IMT technology by making it more accessible and versatile but also enhances its potential for new application domains including non-expert use of sparse IMT with nonrigid sensor attachments in unconstrained environments.</description>

      <title>eRSS-RAMP: A Rule-Adherence Motion Planner Based on Extended Responsibility-Sensitive Safety for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving safety and responsibility determination are indispensable pieces of the puzzle for autonomous driving. They are also deeply related to the allocation of right-of-way and the determination of accident liability. Therefore, Intel/Mobileye designed the responsibility-sensitive safety (RSS) framework to further enhance the safety regulation of autonomous driving, which mathematically defines rules for autonomous vehicles (AVs) behaviors in various traffic scenarios. However, the RSS framework's rules are relatively rudimentary in certain scenarios characterized by interaction uncertainty, especially those requiring collaborative driving during emergency collision avoidance. Besides, the integration of the RSS framework with motion planning is rarely discussed in current studies. Therefore, we proposed a rule-adherence motion planner (RAMP) based on the extended RSS (eRSS) regulation for non-connected and connected AVs in merging and emergency-avoiding scenarios. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method can achieve faster and safer lane merging performance (53.0% shorter merging length and a 73.5% decrease in merging time), and allows for more stable steering maneuvers in emergency collision avoidance, resulting in smoother paths for ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles.</description>

      <title>Modular pipeline for small bodies gravity field modeling: an efficient representation of variable density spherical harmonics coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity operations to small bodies, such as asteroids and comets, demand high levels of autonomy to achieve cost-effective, safe, and reliable Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) solutions. Enabling autonomous GNC capabilities in the vicinity of these targets is thus vital for future space applications. However, the highly non-linear and uncertain environment characterizing their vicinity poses unique challenges that need to be assessed to grant robustness against unknown shapes and gravity fields. In this paper, a pipeline designed to generate variable density gravity field models is proposed, allowing the generation of a coherent set of scenarios that can be used for design, validation, and testing of GNC algorithms. The proposed approach consists in processing a polyhedral shape model of the body with a given density distribution to compute the coefficients of the spherical harmonics expansion associated with the gravity field. To validate the approach, several comparison are conducted against analytical solutions, literature results, and higher fidelity models, across a diverse set of targets with varying morphological and physical properties. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology, showing good performances in terms of modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. This research presents a faster and more robust framework for generating environmental models to be used in simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing of onboard GNC algorithms.</description>

      <title>Want a Ride? Attitudes Towards Autonomous Driving and Behavior in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research conducted previously has focused on either attitudes toward or behaviors associated with autonomous driving. In this paper, we bridge these two dimensions by exploring how attitudes towards autonomous driving influence behavior in an autonomous car. We conducted a field experiment with twelve participants engaged in non-driving related tasks. Our findings indicate that attitudes towards autonomous driving do not affect participants' driving interventions in vehicle control and eye glance behavior. Therefore, studies on autonomous driving technology lacking field tests might be unreliable for assessing the potential behaviors, attitudes, and acceptance of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Modelling, Design Optimization and Prototype development of Knee Exoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on enhancing the design of an existing knee exoskeleton by addressing limitations in the range of motion (ROM) during Sit-to-Stand (STS) motions. While current knee exoskeletons emphasize toughness and rehabilitation, their closed-loop mechanisms hinder optimal ROM, which is crucial for effective rehabilitation. This research aims to optimize the exoskeleton design to achieve the necessary ROM, improving its functionality in rehabilitation. This can be achieved by utilizing kinematic modeling and formulation, the existing design was represented in the non-linear and non-convex mathematical functions. Optimization techniques, considering constraints based on human leg measurements, were applied to determine the best dimensions for the exoskeleton. This resulted in a significant increase in ROM compared to existing models. A MATLAB program was developed to compare the ROM of the optimized exoskeleton with the original design.
  To validate the practicality of the optimized design, analysis was conducted using a mannequin with average human dimensions, followed by constructing a cardboard dummy model to confirm simulation results. The STS motion of an average human was captured using a camera and TRACKER software, and the motion was compared with that of the dummy model to identify any misalignments between the human and exoskeleton knee joints. Furthermore, a prototype of the knee joint exoskeleton is being developed to further investigate misalignments and improve the design. Future work includes the use of EMG sensors for more detailed analysis and better results.</description>

      <title>Mamba as a motion encoder for robotic imitation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning, particularly with the integration of LLM techniques, are set to significantly improve robots' dexterity and adaptability. In this study, we propose using Mamba, a state-of-the-art architecture with potential applications in LLMs, for robotic imitation learning, highlighting its ability to function as an encoder that effectively captures contextual information. By reducing the dimensionality of the state space, Mamba operates similarly to an autoencoder. It effectively compresses the sequential information into state variables while preserving the essential temporal dynamics necessary for accurate motion prediction. Experimental results in tasks such as cup placing and case loading demonstrate that despite exhibiting higher estimation errors, Mamba achieves superior success rates compared to Transformers in practical task execution. This performance is attributed to Mamba's structure, which encompasses the state space model. Additionally, the study investigates Mamba's capacity to serve as a real-time motion generator with a limited amount of training data.</description>

      <title>Causality-Aware Transformer Networks for Robotic Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning algorithms have garnered growing interest in developing versatile Embodied AI systems. However, current research in this domain reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Embodied AI tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Embodied AI. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost Real-Time Spiking System for Obstacle Detection based on Ultrasonic Sensors and Rate Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of mobile robots, obstacle detection has been a topic of great interest. It has also been a subject of study in neuroscience, where flying insects and bats could be considered two of the most interesting cases in terms of vision-based and sound-based mechanisms for obstacle detection, respectively. Currently, many studies focus on vision-based obstacle detection, but not many can be found regarding sound-based obstacle detection. This work focuses on the latter approach, which also makes use of a Spiking Neural Network to exploit the advantages of these architectures and achieve an approach closer to biology. The complete system was tested through a series of experiments that confirm the validity of the spiking architecture for obstacle detection. It is empirically demonstrated that, when the distance between the robot and the obstacle decreases, the output firing rate of the system increases in response as expected, and vice versa. Therefore, there is a direct relation between the two. Furthermore, there is a distance threshold between detectable and undetectable objects which is also empirically measured in this work. An in-depth study on how this system works at low level based on the Inter-Spike Interval concept was performed, which may be useful in the future development of applications based on spiking filters.</description>

      <title>Surgical Task Automation Using Actor-Critic Frameworks and Self-Supervised Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical robot task automation has recently attracted great attention due to its potential to benefit both surgeons and patients. Reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches have demonstrated promising ability to provide solutions to automated surgical manipulations on various tasks. To address the exploration challenge, expert demonstrations can be utilized to enhance the learning efficiency via imitation learning (IL) approaches. However, the successes of such methods normally rely on both states and action labels. Unfortunately action labels can be hard to capture or their manual annotation is prohibitively expensive owing to the requirement for expert knowledge. It therefore remains an appealing and open problem to leverage expert demonstrations composed of pure states in RL. In this work, we present an actor-critic RL framework, termed AC-SSIL, to overcome this challenge of learning with state-only demonstrations collected by following an unknown expert policy. It adopts a self-supervised IL method, dubbed SSIL, to effectively incorporate demonstrated states into RL paradigms by retrieving from demonstrates the nearest neighbours of the query state and utilizing the bootstrapping of actor networks. We showcase through experiments on an open-source surgical simulation platform that our method delivers remarkable improvements over the RL baseline and exhibits comparable performance against action based IL methods, which implies the efficacy and potential of our method for expert demonstration-guided learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>SOAR: Simultaneous Exploration and Photographing with Heterogeneous UAVs for Fast Autonomous Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant popularity in scene reconstruction. This paper presents SOAR, a LiDAR-Visual heterogeneous multi-UAV system specifically designed for fast autonomous reconstruction of complex environments. Our system comprises a LiDAR-equipped explorer with a large field-of-view (FoV), alongside photographers equipped with cameras. To ensure rapid acquisition of the scene's surface geometry, we employ a surface frontier-based exploration strategy for the explorer. As the surface is progressively explored, we identify the uncovered areas and generate viewpoints incrementally. These viewpoints are then assigned to photographers through solving a Consistent Multiple Depot Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (Consistent-MDMTSP), which optimizes scanning efficiency while ensuring task consistency. Finally, photographers utilize the assigned viewpoints to determine optimal coverage paths for acquiring images. We present extensive benchmarks in the realistic simulator, which validates the performance of SOAR compared with classical and state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>CONClave -- Secure and Robust Cooperative Perception for CAVs Using Authenticated Consensus and Trust Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles have great potential to improve automobile safety and traffic flow, especially in cooperative applications where perception data is shared between vehicles. However, this cooperation must be secured from malicious intent and unintentional errors that could cause accidents. Previous works typically address singular security or reliability issues for cooperative driving in specific scenarios rather than the set of errors together. In this paper, we propose CONClave, a tightly coupled authentication, consensus, and trust scoring mechanism that provides comprehensive security and reliability for cooperative perception in autonomous vehicles. CONClave benefits from the pipelined nature of the steps such that faults can be detected significantly faster and with less compute. Overall, CONClave shows huge promise in preventing security flaws, detecting even relatively minor sensing faults, and increasing the robustness and accuracy of cooperative perception in CAVs while adding minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Imitation-Learning Motion Planner for Urban Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the release of open source datasets such as nuPlan and Argoverse, the research around learning-based planners has spread a lot in the last years. Existing systems have shown excellent capabilities in imitating the human driver behaviour, but they struggle to guarantee safe closed-loop driving. Conversely, optimization-based planners offer greater security in short-term planning scenarios. To confront this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid motion planner that integrates both learning-based and optimization-based techniques. Initially, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) generates a human-like trajectory, which is then refined by an optimization-based component. This component not only minimizes tracking errors but also computes a trajectory that is both kinematically feasible and collision-free with obstacles and road boundaries. Our model effectively balances safety and human-likeness, mitigating the trade-off inherent in these objectives. We validate our approach through simulation experiments and further demonstrate its efficacy by deploying it in real-world self-driving vehicles.</description>

      <title>RoboTwin: Dual-Arm Robot Benchmark with Generative Digital Twins (early version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective collaboration of dual-arm robots and their tool use capabilities are increasingly important areas in the advancement of robotics. These skills play a significant role in expanding robots' ability to operate in diverse real-world environments. However, progress is impeded by the scarcity of specialized training data. This paper introduces RoboTwin, a novel benchmark dataset combining real-world teleoperated data with synthetic data from digital twins, designed for dual-arm robotic scenarios. Using the COBOT Magic platform, we have collected diverse data on tool usage and human-robot interaction. We present a innovative approach to creating digital twins using AI-generated content, transforming 2D images into detailed 3D models. Furthermore, we utilize large language models to generate expert-level training data and task-specific pose sequences oriented toward functionality. Our key contributions are: 1) the RoboTwin benchmark dataset, 2) an efficient real-to-simulation pipeline, and 3) the use of language models for automatic expert-level data generation. These advancements are designed to address the shortage of robotic training data, potentially accelerating the development of more capable and versatile robotic systems for a wide range of real-world applications.

      <title>Deep Neural Implicit Representation of Accessibility for Multi-Axis Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main concerns in design and process planning for multi-axis additive and subtractive manufacturing is collision avoidance between moving objects (e.g., tool assemblies) and stationary objects (e.g., a part unified with fixtures). The collision measure for various pairs of relative rigid translations and rotations between the two pointsets can be conceptualized by a compactly supported scalar field over the 6D non-Euclidean configuration space. Explicit representation and computation of this field is costly in both time and space. If we fix $O(m)$ sparsely sampled rotations (e.g., tool orientations), computation of the collision measure field as a convolution of indicator functions of the 3D pointsets over a uniform grid (i.e., voxelized geometry) of resolution $O(n^3)$ via fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) scales as in $O(mn^3 \log n)$ in time and $O(mn^3)$ in space. In this paper, we develop an implicit representation of the collision measure field via deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that our approach is able to accurately interpolate the collision measure from a sparse sampling of rotations, and can represent the collision measure field with a small memory footprint. Moreover, we show that this representation can be efficiently updated through fine-tuning to more efficiently train the network on multi-resolution data, as well as accommodate incremental changes to the geometry (such as might occur in iterative processes such as topology optimization of the part subject to CNC tool accessibility constraints).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Situation awareness is essential for understanding and reasoning about 3D scenes in embodied AI agents. However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Deep Brain Ultrasound Ablation Thermal Dose Modeling with in Vivo Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracorporeal needle-based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU) is a minimally invasive option for intervening in malignant brain tumors, commonly used in thermal ablation procedures. This technique is suitable for both primary and metastatic cancers, utilizing a high-frequency alternating electric field (up to 10 MHz) to excite a piezoelectric transducer. The resulting rapid deformation of the transducer produces an acoustic wave that propagates through tissue, leading to localized high-temperature heating at the target tumor site and inducing rapid cell death. To optimize the design of NBTU transducers for thermal dose delivery during treatment, numerical modeling of the acoustic pressure field generated by the deforming piezoelectric transducer is frequently employed. The bioheat transfer process generated by the input pressure field is used to track the thermal propagation of the applicator over time. Magnetic resonance thermal imaging (MRTI) can be used to experimentally validate these models. Validation results using MRTI demonstrated the feasibility of this model, showing a consistent thermal propagation pattern. However, a thermal damage isodose map is more advantageous for evaluating therapeutic efficacy. To achieve a more accurate simulation based on the actual brain tissue environment, a new finite element method (FEM) simulation with enhanced damage evaluation capabilities was conducted. The results showed that the highest temperature and ablated volume differed between experimental and simulation results by 2.1884{\deg}C (3.71%) and 0.0631 cm$^3$ (5.74%), respectively. The lowest Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for peak temperature was 0.7117, and the lowest Dice coefficient for the ablated area was 0.7021, indicating a good agreement in accuracy between simulation and experiment.</description>

      <title>Cog-GA: A Large Language Models-based Generative Agent for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) represents a frontier in embodied AI, demanding agents to navigate freely in unbounded 3D spaces solely guided by natural language instructions. This task introduces distinct challenges in multimodal comprehension, spatial reasoning, and decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Cog-GA, a generative agent founded on large language models (LLMs) tailored for VLN-CE tasks. Cog-GA employs a dual-pronged strategy to emulate human-like cognitive processes. Firstly, it constructs a cognitive map, integrating temporal, spatial, and semantic elements, thereby facilitating the development of spatial memory within LLMs. Secondly, Cog-GA employs a predictive mechanism for waypoints, strategically optimizing the exploration trajectory to maximize navigational efficiency. Each waypoint is accompanied by a dual-channel scene description, categorizing environmental cues into 'what' and 'where' streams as the brain. This segregation enhances the agent's attentional focus, enabling it to discern pertinent spatial information for navigation. A reflective mechanism complements these strategies by capturing feedback from prior navigation experiences, facilitating continual learning and adaptive replanning. Extensive evaluations conducted on VLN-CE benchmarks validate Cog-GA's state-of-the-art performance and ability to simulate human-like navigation behaviors. This research significantly contributes to the development of strategic and interpretable VLN-CE agents.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Navigation with Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language navigation (VLN) is a critical domain within embedded intelligence, requiring agents to navigate 3D environments based on natural language instructions. Traditional VLN research has focused on improving environmental understanding and decision accuracy. However, these approaches often exhibit a significant performance gap when agents are deployed in novel environments, mainly due to the limited diversity of training data. Expanding datasets to cover a broader range of environments is impractical and costly. We propose the Vision-Language Navigation with Continual Learning (VLNCL) paradigm to address this challenge. In this paradigm, agents incrementally learn new environments while retaining previously acquired knowledge. VLNCL enables agents to maintain an environmental memory and extract relevant knowledge, allowing rapid adaptation to new environments while preserving existing information. We introduce a novel dual-loop scenario replay method (Dual-SR) inspired by brain memory replay mechanisms integrated with VLN agents. This method facilitates consolidating past experiences and enhances generalization across new tasks. By utilizing a multi-scenario memory buffer, the agent efficiently organizes and replays task memories, thereby bolstering its ability to adapt quickly to new environments and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our work pioneers continual learning in VLN agents, introducing a novel experimental setup and evaluation metrics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive evaluations and establish a benchmark for the VLNCL paradigm. Comparative experiments with existing continual learning and VLN methods show significant improvements, achieving state-of-the-art performance in continual learning ability and highlighting the potential of our approach in enabling rapid adaptation while preserving prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>SurgTrack: CAD-Free 3D Tracking of Real-world Surgical Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-based surgical navigation has received increasing attention due to its non-invasive, cost-effective, and flexible advantages. In particular, a critical element of the vision-based navigation system is tracking surgical instruments. Compared with 2D instrument tracking methods, 3D instrument tracking has broader value in clinical practice, but is also more challenging due to weak texture, occlusion, and lack of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models for 3D registration. To solve these challenges, we propose the SurgTrack, a two-stage 3D instrument tracking method for CAD-free and robust real-world applications. In the first registration stage, we incorporate an Instrument Signed Distance Field (SDF) modeling the 3D representation of instruments, achieving CAD-freed 3D registration. Due to this, we can obtain the location and orientation of instruments in the 3D space by matching the video stream with the registered SDF model. In the second tracking stage, we devise a posture graph optimization module, leveraging the historical tracking results of the posture memory pool to optimize the tracking results and improve the occlusion robustness. Furthermore, we collect the Instrument3D dataset to comprehensively evaluate the 3D tracking of surgical instruments. The extensive experiments validate the superiority and scalability of our SurgTrack, by outperforming the state-of-the-arts with a remarkable improvement. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/wenwucode/SurgTrack.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Error Detection System for Advanced Vehicle Instrument Cluster Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automotive industry is currently expanding digital display options with every new model that comes onto the market. This entails not just an expansion in dimensions, resolution, and customization choices, but also the capability to employ novel display effects like overlays while assembling the content of the display cluster. Unfortunately, this raises the need for appropriate monitoring systems that can detect rendering errors and apply appropriate countermeasures when required. Classical solutions such as Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) will soon be no longer viable as any sort of alpha blending, warping of scaling of content can cause unwanted CRC violations. Therefore, we propose a novel monitoring approach to verify correctness of displayed content using telltales (e.g. warning signs) as example. It uses a learning-based approach to separate "good" telltales, i.e. those that a human driver will understand correctly, and "corrupted" telltales, i.e. those that will not be visible or perceived correctly. As a result, it possesses inherent resilience against individual pixel errors and implicitly supports changing backgrounds, overlay or scaling effects. This is underlined by our experimental study where all "corrupted" test patterns were correctly classified, while no false alarms were triggered.</description>

      <title>Human-Like Implicit Intention Expression for Autonomous Driving Motion Planning: A Method Based on Learning Human Intention Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key factors determining whether autonomous vehicles (AVs) can be seamlessly integrated into existing traffic systems is their ability to interact smoothly and efficiently with human drivers and communicate their intentions. While many studies have focused on enhancing AVs' human-like interaction and communication capabilities at the behavioral decision-making level, a significant gap remains between the actual motion trajectories of AVs and the psychological expectations of human drivers. This discrepancy can seriously affect the safety and efficiency of AV-HV (Autonomous Vehicle-Human Vehicle) interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a motion planning method for AVs that incorporates implicit intention expression. First, we construct a trajectory space constraint based on human implicit intention priors, compressing and pruning the trajectory space to generate candidate motion trajectories that consider intention expression. We then apply maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning to learn and estimate human trajectory preferences, constructing a reward function that represents the cognitive characteristics of drivers. Finally, using a Boltzmann distribution, we establish a probabilistic distribution of candidate trajectories based on the reward obtained, selecting human-like trajectory actions. We validated our approach on a real trajectory dataset and compared it with several baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our method excels in human-likeness, intention expression capability, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Invariant Smoothing for Localization: Including the IMU Biases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate smoothing (i.e., optimisation-based) estimation techniques for robot localization using an IMU aided by other localization sensors. We more particularly focus on Invariant Smoothing (IS), a variant based on the use of nontrivial Lie groups from robotics. We study the recently introduced Two Frames Group (TFG), and prove it can fit into the framework of Invariant Smoothing in order to better take into account the IMU biases, as compared to the state-of-the-art in robotics. Experiments based on the KITTI dataset show the proposed framework compares favorably to the state-of-the-art smoothing methods in terms of robustness in some challenging situations.</description>

      <title>MOKA: Open-World Robotic Manipulation through Mark-Based Visual Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-world generalization requires robotic systems to have a profound understanding of the physical world and the user command to solve diverse and complex tasks. While the recent advancement in vision-language models (VLMs) has offered unprecedented opportunities to solve open-world problems, how to leverage their capabilities to control robots remains a grand challenge. In this paper, we introduce Marking Open-world Keypoint Affordances (MOKA), an approach that employs VLMs to solve robotic manipulation tasks specified by free-form language instructions. Central to our approach is a compact point-based representation of affordance, which bridges the VLM's predictions on observed images and the robot's actions in the physical world. By prompting the pre-trained VLM, our approach utilizes the VLM's commonsense knowledge and concept understanding acquired from broad data sources to predict affordances and generate motions. To facilitate the VLM's reasoning in zero-shot and few-shot manners, we propose a visual prompting technique that annotates marks on images, converting affordance reasoning into a series of visual question-answering problems that are solvable by the VLM. We further explore methods to enhance performance with robot experiences collected by MOKA through in-context learning and policy distillation. We evaluate and analyze MOKA's performance on various table-top manipulation tasks including tool use, deformable body manipulation, and object rearrangement.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of GPU Sample-Based Stochastic Predictive Controllers for Legged Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots excel in mobility, navigating complex terrains with agility. However, their complex control systems present challenges that are still far from being fully addressed. In this paper, we introduce the use of Sample-Based Stochastic control strategies for quadrupedal robots, as an alternative to traditional optimal control laws. We show that Sample-Based Stochastic methods, supported by GPU acceleration, can be effectively applied to real quadruped robots. In particular, in this work, we focus on achieving gait frequency adaptation, a notable challenge in quadrupedal locomotion for gradient-based methods. To validate the effectiveness of Sample-Based Stochastic controllers we test two distinct approaches for quadrupedal robots and compare them against a conventional gradient-based Model Predictive Control system. Our findings, validated both in simulation and on a real 21Kg Aliengo quadruped, demonstrate that our method is on par with a traditional Model Predictive Control strategy when the robot is subject to zero or moderate disturbance, while it surpasses gradient-based methods in handling sustained external disturbances, thanks to the straightforward gait adaptation strategy that is possible to achieve within their formulation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Model Predictive Control for Legged Robots through Distributed Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance Model Predictive Control (MPC) for legged robots through Distributed Optimization. Our method focuses on decomposing the robot dynamics into smaller, parallelizable subsystems, and utilizing the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to ensure consensus among them. Each subsystem is managed by its own Optimal Control Problem, with ADMM facilitating consistency between their optimizations. This approach not only decreases the computational time but also allows for effective scaling with more complex robot configurations, facilitating the integration of additional subsystems such as articulated arms on a quadruped robot. We demonstrate, through numerical evaluations, the convergence of our approach on two systems with increasing complexity. In addition, we showcase that our approach converges towards the same solution when compared to a state-of-the-art centralized whole-body MPC implementation. Moreover, we quantitatively compare the computational efficiency of our method to the centralized approach, revealing up to a 75% reduction in computational time. Overall, our approach offers a promising avenue for accelerating MPC solutions for legged robots, paving the way for more effective utilization of the computational performance of modern hardware.</description>

      <title>Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</description>

      <title>Can Vehicle Motion Planning Generalize to Realistic Long-tail Scenarios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world autonomous driving systems must make safe decisions in the face of rare and diverse traffic scenarios. Current state-of-the-art planners are mostly evaluated on real-world datasets like nuScenes (open-loop) or nuPlan (closed-loop). In particular, nuPlan seems to be an expressive evaluation method since it is based on real-world data and closed-loop, yet it mostly covers basic driving scenarios. This makes it difficult to judge a planner's capabilities to generalize to rarely-seen situations. Therefore, we propose a novel closed-loop benchmark interPlan containing several edge cases and challenging driving scenarios. We assess existing state-of-the-art planners on our benchmark and show that neither rule-based nor learning-based planners can safely navigate the interPlan scenarios. A recently evolving direction is the usage of foundation models like large language models (LLM) to handle generalization. We evaluate an LLM-only planner and introduce a novel hybrid planner that combines an LLM-based behavior planner with a rule-based motion planner that achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark.</description>

      <title>GISR: Geometric Initialization and Silhouette-based Refinement for Single-View Robot Pose and Configuration Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous robotics, measurement of the robot's internal state and perception of its environment, including interaction with other agents such as collaborative robots, are essential. Estimating the pose of the robot arm from a single view has the potential to replace classical eye-to-hand calibration approaches and is particularly attractive for online estimation and dynamic environments. In addition to its pose, recovering the robot configuration provides a complete spatial understanding of the observed robot that can be used to anticipate the actions of other agents in advanced robotics use cases. Furthermore, this additional redundancy enables the planning and execution of recovery protocols in case of sensor failures or external disturbances. We introduce GISR - a deep configuration and robot-to-camera pose estimation method that prioritizes execution in real-time. GISR consists of two modules: (i) a geometric initialization module that efficiently computes an approximate robot pose and configuration, and (ii) a deep iterative silhouette-based refinement module that arrives at a final solution in just a few iterations. We evaluate GISR on publicly available data and show that it outperforms existing methods of the same class in terms of both speed and accuracy, and can compete with approaches that rely on ground-truth proprioception and recover only the pose.</description>

      <title>OpenVLA: An Open-Source Vision-Language-Action Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large policies pretrained on a combination of Internet-scale vision-language data and diverse robot demonstrations have the potential to change how we teach robots new skills: rather than training new behaviors from scratch, we can fine-tune such vision-language-action (VLA) models to obtain robust, generalizable policies for visuomotor control. Yet, widespread adoption of VLAs for robotics has been challenging as 1) existing VLAs are largely closed and inaccessible to the public, and 2) prior work fails to explore methods for efficiently fine-tuning VLAs for new tasks, a key component for adoption. Addressing these challenges, we introduce OpenVLA, a 7B-parameter open-source VLA trained on a diverse collection of 970k real-world robot demonstrations. OpenVLA builds on a Llama 2 language model combined with a visual encoder that fuses pretrained features from DINOv2 and SigLIP. As a product of the added data diversity and new model components, OpenVLA demonstrates strong results for generalist manipulation, outperforming closed models such as RT-2-X (55B) by 16.5% in absolute task success rate across 29 tasks and multiple robot embodiments, with 7x fewer parameters. We further show that we can effectively fine-tune OpenVLA for new settings, with especially strong generalization results in multi-task environments involving multiple objects and strong language grounding abilities, and outperform expressive from-scratch imitation learning methods such as Diffusion Policy by 20.4%. We also explore compute efficiency; as a separate contribution, we show that OpenVLA can be fine-tuned on consumer GPUs via modern low-rank adaptation methods and served efficiently via quantization without a hit to downstream success rate. Finally, we release model checkpoints, fine-tuning notebooks, and our PyTorch codebase with built-in support for training VLAs at scale on Open X-Embodiment datasets.</description>

      <title>BiKC: Keypose-Conditioned Consistency Policy for Bimanual Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bimanual manipulation tasks typically involve multiple stages which require efficient interactions between two arms, posing step-wise and stage-wise challenges for imitation learning systems. Specifically, failure and delay of one step will broadcast through time, hinder success and efficiency of each sub-stage task, and thereby overall task performance. Although recent works have made strides in addressing certain challenges, few approaches explicitly consider the multi-stage nature of bimanual tasks while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of inference speed. In this paper, we introduce a novel keypose-conditioned consistency policy tailored for bimanual manipulation. It is a hierarchical imitation learning framework that consists of a high-level keypose predictor and a low-level trajectory generator. The predicted keyposes provide guidance for trajectory generation and also mark the completion of one sub-stage task. The trajectory generator is designed as a consistency model trained from scratch without distillation, which generates action sequences conditioning on current observations and predicted keyposes with fast inference speed. Simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses baseline methods in terms of success rate and operational efficiency.

      <title>A unified theory and statistical learning approach for traffic conflict detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified theory and statistical learning approach for traffic conflict detection, addressing the long-existing call for a consistent and comprehensive methodology to evaluate the collision risk emerging in road user interactions. The proposed theory assumes context-dependent probabilistic collision risk and frames conflict detection as assessing this risk by statistical learning of extreme events in daily interactions. Experiments using real-world trajectory data are conducted for demonstration. Firstly, a unified metric for indicating conflicts is trained with lane-changing interactions on German highways. This metric and other existing metrics are then applied to near-crash events from the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study in the U.S. for performance comparison. Results of the experiments show that the trained metric provides effective collision warnings, generalises across distinct datasets and traffic environments, covers a broad range of conflict types, and delivers a long-tailed distribution of conflict intensity. Reflecting on these results, the proposed theory ensures consistent evaluation by a generic formulation that encompasses varying assumptions of traffic conflicts; the statistical learning approach then enables a comprehensive consideration of influencing factors such as motion states of road users, environment conditions, and participant characteristics. Therefore, the theory and learning approach jointly provide an explainable and adaptable methodology for conflict detection among different road users and across various interaction scenarios. This promises to reduce accidents and improve overall traffic safety, by enhanced safety assessment of traffic infrastructures, more effective collision warning systems for autonomous driving, and a deeper understanding of road user behaviour in different traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Magnetic Control of Medical Soft Continuum Robots for Deflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic soft continuum robots (MSCRs) have emerged as powerful devices in endovascular interventions owing to their hyperelastic fibre matrix and enhanced magnetic manipulability. Effective closed-loop control of tethered magnetic devices contributes to the achievement of autonomous vascular robotic surgery. In this article, we employ a magnetic actuation system equipped with a single rotatable permanent magnet to achieve closed-loop deflection control of the MSCR. To this end, we establish a differential kinematic model of MSCRs exposed to non-uniform magnetic fields. The relationship between the existence and uniqueness of Jacobian and the geometric position between robots is deduced. The control direction induced by Jacobian is demonstrated to be crucial in simulations. Then, the corresponding quasi-static control (QSC) framework integrates a linear extended state observer to estimate model uncertainties. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed QSC framework is validated through comparative trajectory tracking experiments with the PD controller under external disturbances. Further extensions are made for the Jacobian to path-following control at the distal end position. The proposed control framework prevents the actuator from reaching the joint limit and achieves fast and low error-tracking performance without overshooting.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-agent Navigation with Lightweight DRL Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16370</link>

Abstract: In this article, we present an end-to-end collision avoidance policy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multi-agent systems, demonstrating encouraging outcomes in real-world applications. In particular, our policy calculates the control commands of the agent based on the raw LiDAR observation. In addition, the number of parameters of the proposed basic model is 140,000, and the size of the parameter file is 3.5 MB, which allows the robot to calculate the actions from the CPU alone. We propose a multi-agent training platform based on a physics-based simulator to further bridge the gap between simulation and the real world. The policy is trained on a policy-gradients-based RL algorithm in a dense and messy training environment. A novel reward function is introduced to address the issue of agents choosing suboptimal actions in some common scenarios. Although the data used for training is exclusively from the simulation platform, the policy can be successfully transferred and deployed in real-world robots. Finally, our policy effectively responds to intentional obstructions and avoids collisions.

      <title>Augmented Reality without Borders: Achieving Precise Localization Without Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual localization is crucial for Computer Vision and Augmented Reality (AR) applications, where determining the camera or device's position and orientation is essential to accurately interact with the physical environment. Traditional methods rely on detailed 3D maps constructed using Structure from Motion (SfM) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which is computationally expensive and impractical for dynamic or large-scale environments. We introduce MARLoc, a novel localization framework for AR applications that uses known relative transformations within image sequences to perform intra-sequence triangulation, generating 3D-2D correspondences for pose estimation and refinement. MARLoc eliminates the need for pre-built SfM maps, providing accurate and efficient localization suitable for dynamic outdoor environments. Evaluation with benchmark datasets and real-world experiments demonstrates MARLoc's state-of-the-art performance and robustness. By integrating MARLoc into an AR device, we highlight its capability to achieve precise localization in real-world outdoor scenarios, showcasing its practical effectiveness and potential to enhance visual localization in AR applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the precision of the HTC VIVE Ultimate Tracker with robotic and human movements under varied environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The HTC VIVE Ultimate Tracker, utilizing inside-out tracking with internal stereo cameras providing 6 DoF tracking without external cameras, offers a cost-efficient and straightforward setup for motion tracking. Initially designed for the gaming and VR industry, we explored its application beyond VR, providing source code for data capturing in both C++ and Python without requiring a VR headset. This study is the first to evaluate the tracker's precision across various experimental scenarios. To assess the robustness of the tracking precision, we employed a robotic arm as a precise and repeatable source of motion. Using the OptiTrack system as a reference, we conducted tests under varying experimental conditions: lighting, movement velocity, environmental changes caused by displacing objects in the scene, and human movement in front of the trackers, as well as varying the displacement size relative to the calibration center. On average, the HTC VIVE Ultimate Tracker achieved a precision of 4.98 mm +/- 4 mm across various conditions. The most critical factors affecting accuracy were lighting conditions, movement velocity, and range of motion relative to the calibration center. For practical evaluation, we captured human movements with 5 trackers in realistic motion capture scenarios. Our findings indicate sufficient precision for capturing human movements, validated through two tasks: a low-dynamic pick-and-place task and high-dynamic fencing movements performed by an elite athlete. Even though its precision is lower than that of conventional fixed-camera-based motion capture systems and its performance is influenced by several factors, the HTC VIVE Ultimate Tracker demonstrates adequate accuracy for a variety of motion tracking applications. Its ability to capture human or object movements outside of VR or MOCAP environments makes it particularly versatile.</description>

      <title>Extending Structural Causal Models for Autonomous Embodied Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we aim to bridge the divide between autonomous embodied systems and causal reasoning. Autonomous embodied systems have come to increasingly interact with humans, and in many cases may pose risks to the physical or mental well-being of those they interact with. Meanwhile causal models, despite their inherent transparency and ability to offer contrastive explanations, have found limited usage within such systems. As such, we first identify the challenges that have limited the integration of structural causal models within autonomous embodied systems. We then introduce a number of theoretical extensions to the structural causal model formalism in order to tackle these challenges. This augments these models to possess greater levels of modularisation and encapsulation, as well presenting a constant space temporal causal model representation. While not an extension itself, we also prove through the extensions we have introduced that dynamically mutable sets can be captured within structural causal models while maintaining a form of causal stationarity. Finally we introduce two case study architectures demonstrating the application of these extensions along with a discussion of where these extensions could be utilised in future work.</description>
